            <p>An active shooter was reported on the Florida State University campus in Tallahassee, prompting a campus-wide alert and lockdown. Police responded to the student union area following reports of gunfire, and a suspect has been taken into custody. Multiple individuals were transported to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare Hospital for treatment, though details on their injuries remain unclear. Students reported hearing numerous shots fired near the student union, leading to widespread panic and evacuation as law enforcement investigates the scene. Classes and events were canceled for the remainder of the day, and students were advised to continue sheltering in place as the situation unfolds.</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-17 13:30:00 EDT</div>

            <p>A large-scale blind taste test conducted by NECTAR revealed that some plant-based meat products are rated as equal to or better than their animal meat counterparts. While animal meats generally received higher scores, 20 plant-based products were rated as high or higher than animal meat versions, especially those from Impossible Foods. Behavioral science suggests that consumer perception of plant-based meat is influenced by preconceived expectations and social norms, not just taste. To increase adoption, plant-based meat companies need to improve taste, lower prices, and address psychological barriers to change consumer behavior.</p>

            <p>Abdul El-Sayed, a former Michigan public health official, has announced his candidacy for the state's open U.S. Senate seat in 2026, setting the stage for a potentially contentious Democratic primary.

The race is expected to draw significant attention, especially concerning the Israel-Hamas conflict's impact on Democratic voters and potential intervention from pro-Israel lobby groups. El-Sayed emphasizes a platform focused on peace, justice, and domestic priorities, contrasting with what he views as excessive military spending abroad.</p>

Staffers at DOGE seemingly updated its claimed savings overnight on Tuesday, erasing approximately $962 million, according to NOTUS. The largest of the disappeared cuts made this week, identified using the Wayback Machine, appears to be a $1.1 billion contract with the Acacia Center for Justice. The group provided legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children who enter the U.S. DOGE initially claimed the termination would save $367 million, but now the contract isn’t listed at all.</p>

            <p>Tax attorneys are reporting that the IRS has become a "zombie" agency due to staff cuts and halted audits of the wealthy. With a significant reduction in staff expected, wealthy taxpayers and attorneys are struggling to navigate the new regime, but high earners may benefit from fewer audits and reviews. The IRS's efforts to target the wealthy are diminishing, and some taxpayers are considering aggressive tax-planning techniques. Studies suggest that the IRS staff cuts could lead to a substantial loss in tax revenue over the next decade.</p>

            <p>A United Airlines Boeing 737-800 experienced a fiery engine malfunction after hitting an animal during takeoff from Denver International Airport. The crew reported striking an animal, believed to be rabbits, prompting an emergency declaration and return to the airport. Fire trucks responded as a standard protocol, and the plane eventually taxied to the gate without further incident. Passengers were rebooked on a new plane to fly to Edmonton. Wildlife strikes are common at Denver International Airport, with over 800 incidents reported last year.</p>

The AIRUS system includes different cup sizes and a pump to collect urine, enhancing comfort and safety during long flights. The development was spurred by a Sky High Relief Challenge and aims to improve pilot performance by eliminating the need to avoid drinking water.</p>

            <p>Global Payments shares experienced a significant drop after announcing its acquisition of Worldpay for over $24 billion and the simultaneous sale of its Issuer Solutions business to Fidelity National Information Services (FIS). The acquisition of Worldpay is intended to expand Global Payments' reach, enabling it to serve over 6 million customers across more than 175 countries. However, investors reacted negatively to the deal. The sale of Issuer Solutions to FIS for $13.5 billion represents a divestiture of a stable growth provider for back-end financial processing.</p>

            <p>Recent literature, particularly from French authors, delves into the lives of the working class, focusing on blue-collar labor and the indignities faced by those in these jobs. Claire Baglin's "On the Clock" provides detailed insights into the realities of working in a fast-food restaurant, highlighting the exploitation of time and the devaluation of workers. In contrast to some American literature that examines white-collar office jobs, these French works often present a critical view of both the working-class origins and the middle-class worlds they ascend into. These narratives capture the complexities and humanity within various forms of labor.</p>

            <p>SpaceX, partnering with Palantir and Anduril, is a frontrunner to build key parts of Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense shield. The plan involves launching hundreds of satellites for missile detection and tracking, with a separate fleet of attack satellites. SpaceX proposes a "subscription service" model for government access to the technology. Some Pentagon officials have expressed concerns about relying on this subscription-based model for such a critical defense program. The potential contract would be a major win for Silicon Valley in defense contracting.</p>

            <p>An Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Nayib Bukele is described as a grotesque spectacle, highlighting both leaders' authoritarian tendencies and Trump's penchant for gaudy displays of wealth. The article critiques Trump's gold-laden redecoration of the Oval Office, drawing parallels to the destructive history of gold mining, particularly in Latin America. It also touches on Bukele's reversal of El Salvador's ban on metal mining, raising concerns about environmental and social consequences. The author connects these elements to argue that the meeting and its symbolism represent violence, displacement, and suffering.</p>
