          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released its final report on the 2023 Titan submersible incident, concluding that faulty engineering caused the fatal implosion. The report states that OceanGate, the operator, constructed the vessel with a carbon fiber composite that failed to meet strength requirements and was not adequately tested. Furthermore, the company misinterpreted real-time monitoring data from a previous dive, failing to recognize that the submersible was already damaged and should have been taken out of service, leading to the preventable deaths of all five passengers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing the need to stop drugs and criminals he alleges are being sent to the U.S. This confirmation follows a series of U.S. military strikes on suspected drug boats off the Venezuelan coast, which have resulted in at least 27 fatalities. The Venezuelan government condemned the announcement as "warmongering," accusing the U.S. of pursuing a regime change policy, while some U.S. lawmakers have questioned the legal authority for such military actions.</p>

          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, have successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their lawsuit against the local school district. A federal judge had ordered them to post the amount as a bond to cover the district's potential legal fees if the parents lose the case. The lawsuit stems from their sons being suspended and found responsible for sexual harassment after they objected to a transgender student using the boys' locker room. The funds will allow their legal challenge, which contests the school's disciplinary actions and policies, to proceed.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given assurances that India will stop purchasing oil from Russia, a move aimed at pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine. While Trump described it as a "big stop," he acknowledged that the halt would not be immediate and would involve a gradual process without a specified timeline. India, one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, has previously defended its purchases as necessary for stabilizing global energy prices, making this commitment a significant development in the U.S.-India relationship.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Jonathan Rinderknecht, the 29-year-old man accused of starting the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles, on three federal charges. He now faces a potential 45-year prison sentence for his alleged role in the blaze that killed 12 people. Prosecutors claim Rinderknecht, working as an Uber driver, ignited a brush fire that smoldered for nearly a week before erupting into one of the most destructive wildfires in the city's history. The indictment adds two new charges, significantly increasing his maximum potential sentence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new policy requiring a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B visa is already impacting the job market, particularly for startups and small businesses that rely on skilled foreign workers. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the high cost is slowing hiring and shrinking the talent pool for specialized roles, especially in fields like artificial intelligence. While the policy is intended to prioritize American workers, it is forcing smaller companies to reconsider their hiring strategies and explore alternatives like upskilling domestic talent and building relationships with U.S. universities.</p>

          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a new model to address the costly and controversial use of hotels for asylum seekers. The plan suggests the government should fund councils and housing associations to purchase properties, which would be added to the social housing stock. This would allow current social housing tenants to move into new homes, freeing up their previous residences for asylum seekers at a fraction of the cost of hotels. The proposal aims to provide a more sustainable and integrated solution while increasing the nation's overall housing supply.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit involving 3,000 people has been filed in the UK against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the company of knowingly selling baby powder contaminated with asbestos for decades. The legal claim, citing internal documents, alleges that J&J was aware of asbestos-like fibers in its talc-based product as early as the 1960s but failed to warn consumers. J&J denies the allegations, stating its product was safe, compliant with regulations, and did not cause cancer.
