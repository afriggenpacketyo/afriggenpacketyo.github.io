The situation highlights the importance of social media in shaping public opinion and political engagement, with some expressing concern that the feud detracts from pressing issues. The public's increased distrust and frustration with their elected leaders is reflected in the jokes and comments made by social media users.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from the U.S., has been returned to face charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for participating in a conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas. The decision to pursue the indictment led to the resignation of a high-ranking federal prosecutor due to concerns that the case was politically motivated. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador for returning Abrego Garcia, who faces a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment for each migrant he transported. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that the charges are an abuse of power to avoid admitting a mistake.</p>

          <p>Tesla faces significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, exacerbated by a public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. The conflict began over Trump's spending bill, leading to online insults and threats to end government contracts and subsidies for Musk's companies. This fallout caused Tesla shares to plummet, wiping out billions in value and damaging a previously beneficial relationship. Concerns are rising among investors and public officials, who are calling for Tesla's board to ensure the company's stability and address Musk's polarizing behavior, which is seen as detrimental to the brand. The company's failure to innovate and address quality issues, coupled with increasing competition, further complicates its situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Elon Musk, access to sensitive Social Security Administration records while legal challenges proceed. The conservative-majority court lifted an injunction, allowing DOGE to access the data to target waste and fraud. Critics, including labor unions and advocacy groups, express concern that this access could lead to misuse of personal information, and one justice dissented, noting the lack of privacy safeguards. The Trump administration claims the data is needed to fulfill DOGE's mission of eliminating bureaucratic tyranny, while opponents fear potential abuse of Americans' private data.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes are back on at San Diego beaches this week after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional and that teaching yoga was “protected speech”. The three-judge panel of the US ninth circuit court of appeals on Wednesday overruled a San Diego judge and decided in favor of two instructors who had sued over a law that San Diego passed in 2024 banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. The ruling stated that the ordinance violated the instructors’ rights, as it targets teaching yoga, implicating their first amendment right to speak. Outdoor yoga is a service to those who are disabled or cannot afford yoga classes elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches following a federal appeals court ruling that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional. The court found that teaching yoga is "protected speech" under the First Amendment. The city had argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as instructors received donations for the classes. One instructor who was cited multiple times for holding classes on the beach has resumed teaching, emphasizing the service outdoor yoga provides to those who are disabled or cannot afford classes elsewhere. The ruling is seen as a triumph of community over a few elites who did not want people disturbing their oceanfront views.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has escalated his feud with Elon Musk, accusing the tech mogul of "losing his mind" after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill. Trump dismissed a potential peacemaking phone call and threatened to cancel Musk's government contracts. The conflict, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's policies, has led to a significant drop in Tesla's stock value and a potential shift in the political landscape. Musk has hinted at starting a new political party, while Trump's allies have suggested Musk should be deported, highlighting the deep divide between the two figures.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo's campaign for New York City mayor received a surprising endorsement from rival Jessica Ramos, despite her previous criticisms of his mental acuity and allegations of sexual misconduct. Ramos cited Cuomo's experience and ability to deliver under pressure as reasons for her support, particularly in facing the Trump administration. The endorsement comes after Cuomo faced attacks over his handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations. The move has been met with dismay from Ramos's progressive allies, while Cuomo has stated he will not be returning the favor with an endorsement of Ramos.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's willingness to spend his fortune on elections gives him the ability to drive a brittle party system into chaos and loosen Trump’s hold on it. Musk's opposition to Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill has raised the specter of his funding primary challenges against Republicans who vote to support the legislation. He has also raised the possibility of starting a new political party, which could attract voters disenchanted with both parties, mostly the disillusioned young men who went to Trump in the 2024 election. The short-term effect would be to help Democrats, and in a 48-48 country, with only a few competitive states and districts, a targeted strike on these pivotal elections could completely upend the system.</p>

The injunction, issued by a federal judge in Massachusetts, prevents the administration from implementing an executive order to reduce staff and transfer programs. The administration argues that the cuts are part of an effort at "streamlining" and that the Executive Branch has the authority to make judgments about staffing levels. The case is a consolidation of two separate cases brought in response to the administration's plans to shrink the Education Department.</p>
