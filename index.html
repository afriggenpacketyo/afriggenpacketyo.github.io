          <p>A streetcar derailment in Lisbon, Portugal, has resulted in at least 15 deaths and 18 injuries, with several individuals in serious condition. Preliminary information suggests that a safety cable on the famed 'Elevador da Gloria' funicular broke, causing the car to go off the rails. The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities. In response to the tragedy, the mayor of Lisbon has declared a three-day period of mourning, and Portugal's Prime Minister's Office announced a national day of mourning.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser as part of an antitrust remedy, a decision that caused parent company Alphabet's stock to surge by 9%. While the judge deemed Google a monopolist, he opted for less severe measures, such as requiring Google to share some search data with rivals, calling a forced divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." The ruling is seen as a significant victory for Google, though the Department of Justice stated the imposed remedies are an important step forward for consumer protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents an analysis arguing that the Trump administration is actively working to rewrite the history of the January 6th Capitol attack, transforming it from an insurrection into a moment of triumph. The piece centers on the decision to grant military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the riot, as a key example of this effort. It also points to pardons for rioters and a proposed compensation fund as further evidence of an attempt to recast the perpetrators as victims.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for New York state, a judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing, specifically whole genome sequencing, can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This cutting-edge technology allowed investigators to extract DNA from degraded, rootless hair samples found on victims, linking them to Heuermann and his family. The ruling is a major victory for the prosecution, though the defense has challenged the decision, claiming the lab used is not licensed in New York.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that there are "no immediate plans" to send the National Guard to Chicago, following President Trump's recent suggestions that federal forces would be sent to the city. Vance stated that while the president believes he has the authority to act, the administration hopes to work with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has called the president's comments "unhinged." The discussion comes as the administration has deployed Guard forces in other major cities and is reportedly planning expanded immigration enforcement in Chicago.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have officially established a new subcommittee to conduct another investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Republican-led panel, chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, aims to "uncover the full truth," with supporters claiming the previous Democratic-led committee was biased. This move is criticized by Democrats as a partisan effort to exonerate former President Donald Trump and rewrite the narrative of the violent event, especially following his mass pardons of convicted rioters.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer has been found guilty of murder for a second time in the 2007 death of her husband, Todd Stermer, and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors argued she set their house on fire and then ran him over with a van as he escaped the blaze. Her initial 2010 conviction was overturned by a federal judge in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel, leading to her temporary release. The case has left her family deeply divided, with her sons believing she is guilty and her daughters maintaining her innocence.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, Britain's deputy prime minister and housing secretary, has admitted to underpaying stamp duty tax on a flat she purchased in Hove. She stated that the error was due to initial legal advice that did not properly account for complex provisions related to a family trust set up for her disabled son. Rayner has contacted tax authorities to resolve the underpayment and has referred herself to the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial interests for an investigation, while receiving backing from Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

The legislation combines several previous proposals and is supported by lawmakers across the political spectrum, from conservative Republicans to progressive Democrats. Supporters argue the ban is essential to eliminate conflicts of interest and address widespread public perception that lawmakers are profiting from their positions.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov survey reveals that American sentiment toward the U.S. economy remains predominantly negative, with most respondents describing it as "uncertain" and "struggling." The poll, which showed a slight dip in positive ratings over the last month, indicates that persistent concerns over rising prices are the main cause of this pessimism. Two-thirds of those surveyed reported that prices are still going up and expect them to continue to do so, contributing to a widespread belief that the economy is getting worse.

          <p>A decade after the 2015 migrant crisis, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared "we can do it," Europe's approach to migration has shifted dramatically towards restriction. This retrospective article examines how concerns about security, economic strain, and national identity have fueled the rise of far-right parties and prompted even centrist governments to implement tougher border controls. Policies now focus on deterrence and outsourcing asylum processing to non-EU countries, a stark contrast to the more welcoming attitudes seen ten years ago.</p>

The negotiated settlement, driven by the Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups, allows these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot when they vote, thereby protecting their right to participate in elections.</p>
