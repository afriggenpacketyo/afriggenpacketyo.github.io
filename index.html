          <p>Brian Wilson, the creative force behind the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82, leaving behind a remarkable musical legacy. Wilson's innovative approach to pop music, characterized by complex harmonies and intricate arrangements, propelled the Beach Boys to international fame. His mental health struggles, including schizoaffective and bipolar disorders, significantly impacted his career and personal life, leading to periods of seclusion and controversial therapeutic interventions. Despite these challenges, Wilson continued to create music and tour, solidifying his status as a pop music icon, and he will be remembered for his contributions to music history.

          <p>John Woeltz and William Duplessie, accused of torturing an Italian businessman in New York City to steal his cryptocurrency, have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, assault, and coercion charges.

The defense argued that video evidence contradicts the victim's account, showing him "having the time of his life."

          <p>A review of the live-action remake of "How to Train Your Dragon" finds the new version lacking the charm and magic of the original animated film. While the story of Hiccup and Toothless remains compelling, the remake is criticized for being longer and less visually stunning. The film's message of empathy and questioning assumptions is still relevant, but the transformation from cartoons to human cartoons offers little gain. The reviewer notes that the film's attempt at naturalism results in dark and cluttered visuals, ultimately making the remake inessential and less emotionally resonant.
