          <p>China and the European Union have scheduled a new round of trade talks to address their economic relationship before a high-level leaders' summit next month. The European Commission announced the talks after a meeting between Chinaâ€™s commerce minister and the EU trade chief in Paris. Both sides have expressed a desire to rebalance trade and level the playing field, but it remains to be seen whether they can resolve the existing economic deadlock. The talks aim to prepare for a summit in Beijing where European leaders will meet with President Xi Jinping to discuss pressing economic and trade issues. The current global economic climate necessitates these discussions, as both regions seek to stabilize and grow their economies.

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates following a disappointing ADP jobs report. Trump criticized Powell on Truth Social, asserting that the Fed chair was making a mistake by not lowering rates, which he believes puts the U.S. at an economic disadvantage compared to Europe and other countries. The ADP report indicated a private payroll increase of only 37,000 in May, significantly below expectations. This development occurred ahead of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' broader nonfarm payrolls report, adding further pressure on Powell and the Fed to consider monetary policy adjustments. Tensions between Trump and Powell remain high, with the President having previously hinted at potentially replacing the Fed chair. (not investment advice)</p>

Society of Sisters, a case that affirmed parental control over children's education. The rally also highlighted anticipation for decisions in two key cases affecting parental rights. One case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, concerns parents' right to opt their children out of exposure to LGBTQ+ content in school, while the other, United States v. Skrmetti, addresses state restrictions on medical treatments for transgender minors. Speakers at the event emphasized the importance of parental involvement in education and advocated for legislation protecting children from certain medical interventions related to gender identity.

Officials have labeled the fungus a potential agroterrorism agent, citing scientific literature that suggests its possible use as an agricultural weapon. Fusarium graminearum is a common fungus that infects various crops, including barley, oats, rice, and wheat, and its introduction could pose a significant threat to agriculture.</p>

The book challenges the notion that homelessness is primarily driven by personal failings, highlighting systemic inequalities and bipartisan policy decisions that have contributed to the crisis. It advocates for the Housing First model and calls for enshrining the human right to housing in law to ensure effective interventions and lasting change, asserting that homelessness is a societal choice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested Congress to rescind $9.4 billion in approved funding for foreign aid and public broadcasters like NPR and PBS. This action aligns with spending cuts identified by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge). The proposed cuts include $8.3 billion from the State Department and USAID, as well as $1.1 billion from NPR and PBS, which are consistent with the administration's ongoing conflict with the media. House Speaker Mike Johnson has pledged to pass the cuts, while NPR and PBS have filed lawsuits, alleging that the cuts violate the First Amendment.</p>

The prosecution argues that Monzo had a clear intention to kill multiple people, regardless of their age or identity, and that Daniel was simply walking to school when he was attacked. The court heard details of the attack, including that Monzo shouted about God during the incident and had previously killed and skinned a cat, and the defense claims that Monzo's behavior was triggered by drug-induced psychosis.</p>

          <p>China has lodged a protest against U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's criticism of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. The Chinese foreign ministry stated that Rubio's comments distorted historical facts and interfered in China's internal affairs. Rubio's statement, published on the State Department's website and social media, praised the courage of the Tiananmen protesters and emphasized the universality of freedom and democracy. Beijing has consistently rejected criticisms of its actions during the crackdown, viewing them as challenges to its political system.</p>
