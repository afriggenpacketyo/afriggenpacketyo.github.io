          <p>Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific AI chips sold in China in exchange for export licenses. This unprecedented arrangement allows the sale of Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export controls. The deal highlights the Trump administration's strategy of using tariffs and special exceptions as bargaining tools in its ongoing economic conflict with China.

          <p>A major wildfire has been burning on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy, forcing the closure of all hiking routes in the popular national park. Firefighting efforts involve numerous ground teams, Canadair planes, and the army creating fire breaks to control the blaze, which has affected over 1,200 acres. While the nearby Pompeii archaeological site remains open, authorities have suspended all park activities for safety. The event is highlighted within the context of increasing wildfire vulnerability across Europe due to climate change and summer heatwaves.</p>

          <p>Vice President J.D. Vance indicated that President Donald Trump is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a punitive measure for China's continued purchase of Russian oil. This potential action is part of the administration's broader strategy to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine. While no firm decision has been made, the move would utilize the same emergency powers invoked for recent tariffs on India. The administration acknowledges the complexity of the issue, given the wide-ranging effects of the U.S.-China economic relationship.</p>

The FDA has expressed concern, noting kratom's potential for abuse and its association with rare cases of death, though often in combination with other drugs. The manufacturer, Botanic Tonics, which previously settled a class-action lawsuit, maintains its product has a very low complaint rate.</p>

          <p>Designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following accusations of cultural appropriation for a shoe design inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was criticized by many, including Mexico's president, for being produced without consultation or credit to the Indigenous communities who originated the design. In response to the backlash, Adidas has removed promotional images and stated its commitment to a respectful dialogue to repair the damage. Chavarria expressed deep regret for not collaborating directly with the Oaxacan community on the project.</p>

          <p>In a rare departure from his anti-debt stance, financial personality Dave Ramsey advised a caller to take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC). The caller, a recently divorced father with a low 2.25% mortgage, needed to pay his ex-wife $150,000 for her share of their home's equity. Ramsey framed the HELOC not as new debt, but as a restructuring of an existing obligation to his ex-wife. He also questioned the caller's emotional attachment to the house, suggesting that selling might be a wiser long-term decision for a fresh start. (not investment advice)</p>

This push is supported by hardline nationalist ministers in the Israeli government, blurring the lines between settlers and the military.

The war resulted in the widespread destruction of infrastructure and communications systems that had been built in the preceding decades. According to Mitter, this devastation effectively forced China to rebuild from scratch in the post-war era, significantly influencing its subsequent political and societal path.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European leaders has publicly stated that Ukraine must be included in any peace negotiations between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The statement from leaders of France, Germany, Poland, the U.K., and the EU Commission came ahead of a planned summit in Alaska to discuss ending the war. While they welcomed diplomatic efforts to "stop the killing," they emphasized that a path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's participation. Vice President JD Vance described the planned summit as a "major breakthrough," though it remains unclear if Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will attend.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old man who reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for personal health issues. The shooter, who killed a DeKalb County police officer before dying at the scene, was armed with five guns and had tried to enter the CDC campus. His father told police his son had become fixated on his distrust of the vaccine. A union for CDC workers stated the attack was not random and demanded federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, which it says puts scientists at risk.</p>

          <p>A violent attack at a nightclub in Ecuador's coastal Guayas province has left eight people dead and three others injured. Authorities reported that heavily armed suspects arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles and opened fire on the patrons. This incident is the latest in a wave of violence sweeping the country, which authorities attribute to disputes between organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels. The country has recorded over 4,000 homicides in the first five months of 2025, with several coastal provinces currently under a state of emergency.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his plan for a military offensive in Gaza City, calling it the "best way" to end the war, while facing widespread condemnation at the UN Security Council. At an emergency meeting, representatives from the UK, France, and China, among others, warned the plan would trigger another humanitarian calamity and endanger hostages. Netanyahu asserted the operation would be swift and aimed to "free Gaza from Hamas," while also dismissing reports of starvation as false. The U.S. defended Israel at the council, stating the war could end if Hamas released the hostages.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. A Los Angeles Times article highlights the law's failures, pointing to an ineffective enforcement system and a recent critical state audit of Cal/OSHA. Advocates and lawmakers argue that the system is failing, as many agricultural employers do not provide adequate water, shade, or rest breaks. The situation is worsened by the fact that many farmworkers are undocumented and fear retaliation if they complain about unsafe working conditions.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched through central London to show support for Israel and demand the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. The protest, led by the UK's chief rabbi, featured Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages. Some participants expressed anger at the UK government's conditional plan to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas." The march occurred with a large security presence, and while mostly peaceful, the Metropolitan Police made three arrests for assault and a public order offense following minor scuffles.</p>

          <p>Actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, has shared that the only early warning sign he experienced was a change in his bowel movements. The 48-year-old "Dawson’s Creek" star said he was otherwise healthy and had no glaring red flags, initially attributing the symptom to his coffee consumption. His experience underscores the importance of cancer screening, as medical experts note that many colorectal cancers develop silently. The recommended screening age has dropped to 45, and doctors emphasize that paying attention to subtle changes can be life-saving.</p>

          <p>A new NPR series explores the significant shifts occurring in the "liberal international order" that has structured global affairs since World War II. The series notes that this system, once defined by U.S. leadership, globalization, and multilateralism, is now fracturing due to the resurgence of authoritarian powers and changing alliances. From a U.S. perspective, President Trump's policies on trade and security alliances are prompting many countries to forge new paths without relying on Washington. This creates an uncertain future as nations look to fill the perceived vacuum left by waning U.S. influence.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has escalated the conflict over a Republican-led redistricting plan, threatening to prolong the fight for "literally years" by calling continuous special legislative sessions. The statement comes as Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to prevent a quorum, blocking a vote on new maps that could give the GOP five additional U.S. House seats. Democratic governors from New York and Illinois, where the Texas lawmakers have sought refuge, have fiercely criticized the plan as anti-democratic cheating. The high-stakes battle has also drawn in figures like Beto O'Rourke and Bernie Sanders.</p>

The silence, held for former Liverpool player Diogo Jota's late brother, was cut short after shouts were heard from the Palace supporters' end. Slot suggested the noise was likely from an unaware fan cheering, which then led to other fans trying to quiet them, creating more noise. He described the incident as unlucky rather than malicious, expressing confidence that fans would be respectful in the future.</p>

The decision, a significant shift in German policy, has drawn criticism from within his own conservative party but support from coalition partners.
