            <p>A federal judge has criticized Justice Department attorneys for their inaction regarding the wrongful detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador. Despite court orders, the judge stated that the Trump administration appears to have done nothing to aid in Abrego Garcia's release. The judge ordered expedited discovery, including sworn testimony from government officials, to determine if the DOJ is complying with court orders. Abrego Garcia, alleged to be an MS-13 member, was deported despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution.</p>

            <p>A study indicates that the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes is declining in the UK before the ban on their sale takes effect on June 1, 2025. Researchers believe that vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban. The percentage of 16-24 year olds who mainly use disposable vapes has nearly halved in the last year. The ban aims to reduce littering and protect children from rising rates of youth vaping.</p>

            <p>The New Orleans Saints have won a legal battle over the fleur-de-lis trademark against a man claiming to be a descendant of French royalty. Michel J Messier argued that his family held intellectual property rights to the symbol due to their royal lineage. The court dismissed the appeal, stating that Messier had failed to demonstrate any commercial interest or injury from the Saints' use of the trademark. The decision affirms the Saints' right to use the fleur-de-lis on football helmets and merchandise.</p>
