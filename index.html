            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to pause the deportation of accused Venezuelan gang members under an 18th-century wartime law.

The Supreme Court ordered the government to "not remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court".

            <p>Congressional Republicans are advocating for the reauthorization of President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire later this year. Republicans argue that failing to make the tax cuts permanent would result in significant tax increases for many Americans and potentially trigger a recession. Democrats, however, criticize the tax cuts as primarily benefiting the wealthy and exacerbating income inequality. The debate centers on whether to extend the tax cuts for all, raise rates on the wealthy, or find a compromise that addresses both economic growth and fairness (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>US Vice President JD Vance met with Vatican officials following Pope Francis' criticism of the Trump administration's migration policies. Francis had rebuked Vance's theological justification for the administration's America-first approach to immigration, which prioritizes citizens over migrants. Vance, a Catholic convert, has defended the administration's policies by citing the concept of "ordo amoris," a hierarchy of care. Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept in a letter, emphasizing a universal fraternity without exception.</p>

            <p>Economists are concerned that President Trump's escalating trade war and tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, with companies using tariffs as an excuse to raise prices beyond actual cost increases. The fear is that businesses may inflate prices to increase profits, rather than simply passing on legitimate cost increases to consumers. This could result in a self-fulfilling cycle of inflation, as consumers expect higher prices and companies take advantage of the situation. Some experts suggest that the tariffs could lead to an average household loss of approximately $4,900 (not investment advice).</p>

The goal is to cultivate a sense of community within the country, representing it as diverse but unified, while respecting and accommodating differences.

            <p>President Trump posted an image, possibly digitally altered, claiming that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father deported to El Salvador, has an MS-13 tattoo on his knuckles. This action follows court orders demanding that the Trump administration facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., where he has lived for 14 years. Government attorneys have never referenced tattoos in court filings to support claims that Abrego Garcia is a gang member.

            <p>US senator Chris Van Hollen says 'traumatised' man deported to El Salvador moved to new prison. A Maryland man who the Trump administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador has been moved to a new prison, US Senator Chris Van Hollen has said. The Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar Ábrego García, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month. Mr Ábrego García was "traumatised" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the facility, Van Hollen said, adding that he was moved to another facility in the country over a week ago. The Supreme Court has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, however Trump administration officials have continued to push back against the order.</p>

            <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported from the US to El Salvador, has sparked a legal battle over immigration policy. Despite US courts ruling that Abrego Garcia was deported in error, the White House claims he is a member of MS-13. Abrego Garcia denies the allegation and has never been convicted of a crime. Police records show an incident in 2019 where Abrego Garcia was identified as an MS-13 member, but his lawyers argue that he has no criminal record and has lived in the US for 14 years with his family.</p>

            <p>President Trump stated that the US will "take a pass" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine peace talks if Moscow or Kyiv "make it very difficult" to reach a deal. This statement came hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks without clear signs of progress within days. Trump's direct diplomacy with Putin and criticism of Zelensky have raised concerns among NATO allies. Despite initial confidence, attempts to reach a ceasefire have yet to materialize, with Washington blaming both sides.</p>

            <p>A Somali film warning of revenge killings, 'Clan Vengeance,' has gained attention after one of its actors, Guudey Mohamed Geedi, was shot dead in a clan-related killing. Geedi played a character who intervened to stop a killing in the film, which aimed to highlight the futility of vendettas between rival clans. The director hopes the film will raise awareness about the humanitarian cost of clan violence in Somalia. Clan identity is deeply ingrained in Somali society, contributing to internal conflicts and displacement.</p>

Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home. He became a minister in prison, leading to a reduced sentence. Newsom's pardon follows efforts to help immigrants targeted for deportation. Newsom also offered a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a U.S. Army veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.</p>

Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The court's order does not rule on the merits of Boasberg's inquiry but sets deadlines for replies from both sides. Boasberg had found probable cause that the Trump administration acted in contempt of court when it defied his order to return the deportation flights to the U.S.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring US bond markets, which have experienced volatility due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade tariffs. Bond yields rose sharply as investors lost confidence in the US economy, demanding higher returns to compensate for increased risk. This can affect public spending, household finances, and business borrowing rates. Some analysts draw parallels to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, warning of a potential risk premium in US Treasury bonds (not investment advice).</p>
