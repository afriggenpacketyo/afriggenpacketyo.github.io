          <p>Over 20 individuals were arrested in London during a protest supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000. The demonstration in Westminster saw a small group holding placards with messages like "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action." Following a failed court bid to block the ban, supporting or being a member of the group is now a criminal offense, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrests as the new designation took effect.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, marine scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to shift public opinion about the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team examines shark stomach contents to understand both the animal's health and the broader ocean ecosystem, operating on the principle that healthy sharks indicate a healthy ocean. Despite the importance of their research for marine conservation, scientists face challenges in securing funding due to the public's ingrained fear of sharks, which hinders financial support for their work.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is exploring the idea of creating and funding a new political party, tentatively called the "America Party," to challenge the two-party system in the U.S. He suggests the party could gain significant influence by focusing on a few key House and Senate races, potentially becoming a deciding vote in a narrowly divided Congress. This consideration follows a public feud with President Donald Trump over a recent spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed. An informal poll on his social media platform, X, showed majority support for the idea among respondents.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a large-scale luxury tourist resort in Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amidst international sanctions and the pandemic. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features high-rise hotels and amenities for 20,000 guests, reflecting Kim Jong Un's goal of boosting the economy through tourism. However, the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors, with the exception of small, controlled groups from Russia. Analysts remain skeptical about the resort's economic impact, given North Korea's ongoing military ambitions and severe restrictions on its own citizens.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has resulted in at least 16 deaths, with rescue operations continuing for a second day. Emergency crews are searching for at least eight more people believed to be trapped in the rubble, though rescue efforts are hampered by the building's location on a narrow street. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards, substandard materials, and lax enforcement of safety regulations frequently lead to structural failures and tragic loss of life.</p>

          <p>A doctor at a public hospital details the immense challenges faced by low-income patients, arguing that new work requirements for Medicaid will be devastating. The article illustrates how bureaucratic hurdles disproportionately affect those who are homeless, disabled, or lack resources like phones and internet, making it nearly impossible for them to comply even if they qualify for exemptions. The author warns that these changes, projected to cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose insurance by 2034, are designed to cut costs by disenfranchising the most vulnerable, which will strain safety-net hospitals and ultimately harm public health.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google X executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for better emotional regulation. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. By consciously choosing not to re-engage with the negative thought after this period, individuals can prevent prolonged distress. Gawdat, who began his work after the tragic death of his son, advises asking practical questions to assess a situation's truth and one's ability to act, fostering a more resilient and fulfilled life.</p>

The experiment changed her definition of self-care from passive appointments to active, skill-building pursuits.

The author suggests that prosecutors resorted to trafficking charges due to weak domestic violence statutes.

          <p>Nestor Montalvo, a 61-year-old retired police officer, survived a major stroke after initially mistaking his symptoms of headache and blurred vision for a bad hangover. After collapsing at home, he was rushed to the hospital where doctors diagnosed a severe ischemic stroke and gave him a low chance of survival. Thanks to the hospital's rapid stroke protocol, he received clot-busting medication and underwent procedures that saved his life. The article details his difficult but successful road to recovery, which involved extensive speech and physical therapy to regain his ability to talk, swallow, and walk.</p>

          <p>A coalition of environmental groups, businesses, and residents in northern Florida has successfully campaigned for a new law banning oil and gas exploration near the ecologically vital Apalachicola River basin. The "Kill the Drill" movement formed after a state permit was granted for exploratory drilling, sparking fears of a repeat of the economic and environmental devastation threatened by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. After legal challenges and intense lobbying, the state legislature passed a bill, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, that prohibits drilling within 10 miles of sensitive estuaries in the region.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty and reduced consumer spending, fast-casual restaurant chains like Chipotle, Cava, and Starbucks are heavily investing in their loyalty programs to drive repeat business. With overall restaurant traffic declining, these programs have become essential for building customer habits and providing value beyond simple coupons.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Apple TV+ series "Murderbot," based on Martha Wells' novellas, presents a unique twist on the artificial intelligence narrative. Its protagonist is a security cyborg (played by Alexander Skarsgård) that hacks its own programming to achieve free will, only to use its autonomy to secretly watch soap operas and avoid human interaction. The show subverts the common trope of AI seeking to become more human; instead, Murderbot is content being a machine and finds humans to be an annoying inconvenience. This take offers a quirky and insightful departure from typical sci-fi stories about machine consciousness.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts their experience with Google's Gemini AI, which, with access to their Google Drive and Gmail data, was able to draft a startlingly personal and accurate birthday letter for a best friend. The essay explores the new frontier of hyper-personalized AI, where chatbots can mine years of a user's personal data—emails, documents, and photos—to generate intimate and context-aware content. While testing the AI's capabilities, the author found it could create a detailed "CIA dossier" on them, highlighting both the impressive potential and the profound privacy implications of this evolving technology.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the cultural significance of the British Royal Warrant, the seal of approval the monarchy grants to certain goods and services. As the Prince and Princess of Wales prepare to grant their own warrants, the article notes the diverse list of approved companies, from luxury brands like Bentley to practical services like chimney sweeps. The author suggests that this royal endorsement still carries significant weight, particularly with American consumers, citing a poll where a surprising number of young Americans favored being ruled by the British monarch, highlighting the monarchy's potent "soft power."</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has voiced her distrust in the electronic line-calling system being used at Wimbledon for the first time, calling some decisions "dodgy" and "very wrong." Following her third-round loss, she pointed to a specific call that she felt was incorrect and noted that the automated "out" calls were often too quiet to hear over the crowd noise. Raducanu is not alone in her criticism, with other players also questioning the system's accuracy. The All England Club's chair defended the technology, stating it was implemented in response to player demand for more accuracy than human line judges.</p>

          <p>Eight key OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective crude oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels and continues the process of unwinding voluntary supply cuts. The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories. This move further accelerates the pace at which the group is returning supply to the market after implementing significant cuts to support prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article profiles the Rev. William Barber and his revived Poor People's Campaign, a national "fusion movement" using nonviolent protest and moral framing to challenge systemic inequality. Rooted in the Black prophetic tradition, the movement confronts what Barber calls "policy murder"—legislation that slashes services for the poor while benefiting the wealthy. The piece follows a "Moral Monday" protest in Washington D.C., highlighting the campaign's strategy of disciplined civil disobedience to force a moral reckoning on issues like healthcare, food aid, and voting rights, arguing that true national healing requires addressing these fundamental injustices.</p>

However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could now negatively affect a person's credit score.

Additionally, farmers are struggling with rising land prices due to development, labor shortages for harvesting and processing, and the economic impact of tariffs.

While the strikes significantly damaged Iran's nuclear facilities, the country retains the knowledge, centrifuges, and enriched uranium to reconstitute its program. Tehran has already limited international inspectors' access and has vowed to rebuild. The war demonstrated Iran's ability to strike Israel with ballistic missiles, and the high cost of Israel's defense systems suggests a "mowing the grass" strategy may not be sustainable, setting the stage for a prolonged, tense standoff.</p>
