          <p>Six people were injured in a targeted act of violence at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails while yelling "free Palestine." The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, were outside the Boulder County Courthouse, and one was critically injured. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis condemning the attack. The event was organized by Run For Their Lives, which hosts weekly silent marches to raise awareness for hostages still in Gaza, and they have since cancelled upcoming events until further notice. The Boulder Jewish community expressed sadness and heartbreak over the attack, emphasizing the importance of community support and safety. </p>

          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic halted operations in 2020, with demand for luxury maritime journeys surging due to pent-up wanderlust and new investments. Japanese ports are seeing record domestic passenger numbers, boosting local economies that rely on tourism. Shipping giants like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines (MOL) are expanding their cruise ship fleets, with NYK Cruises launching the Asuka III and Mitsui Ocean Cruises adding a third ship. The Asuka III, Yokohama-based, will be the largest passenger ship in the Japanese fleet, featuring frescoes and private seaside balconies. These developments indicate a shift towards cruise ships as stable income streams for Japanese shipping companies amidst challenges in their core cargo business.</p>

          <p>With the Trump administration's increased focus on deportations, there is growing fear among U.S. residents, even those with legal status or citizenship, when traveling outside the country. Immigration attorney √Ålex G√°lvez notes that citizens should not fear questioning upon return, but residents may face scrutiny at the discretion of immigration officials. Residents staying abroad for more than six months may be considered to have abandoned their residency, and those with criminal records risk being denied entry. G√°lvez advises residents planning to stay abroad longer than six months to apply for a permit and consult an immigration attorney if they have a criminal record, as not all crimes lead to deportation.</p>

The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated it delivered aid without incident, dismissing reports of deaths and injuries, but previous GHF distributions have been marred by chaos, with witnesses reporting Israeli troops firing on crowds.</p>

She views the partial revocation of the U.S. government's license to Chevron as a welcome decision, emphasizing Venezuela's need for investments when democracy returns. Machado believes the Maduro regime is increasingly isolated and faces an unsustainable economic crisis, with projections indicating further economic contraction and dire living conditions for Venezuelans.

Trump suggested he would no longer be "Mr. NICE GUY" to China and would raise tariffs on steel imports, reversing a d√©tente in May that had lifted stocks. While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite enjoyed their best month since November 2023, investor sentiment could quickly change based on White House communications.

          <p>A Universities UK report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as institutions struggle with cost cuts and efficiency. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) acknowledges the financial challenges and aims to support collaboration where possible, but universities are hesitant due to competition laws. Sir Nigel Carrington suggests neighboring universities should agree on which courses to offer to maximize cost-effectiveness. University budgets are strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation, leading to course cutbacks and job losses. The government is reviewing higher education funding in England, with Skills Minister Jacqui Smith expressing support for universities contributing more to economic growth.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs, as widespread displacement of families occurs across the country. Their report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. The report highlights the struggles of families like Shanice Aird, who faces homelessness after rejecting unsuitable accommodation far from her children's school. More than 164,000 children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, impacting their education and well-being, and the Local Government Association is calling for increased temporary accommodation subsidies. The government says the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill aims to introduce better protections for vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing criticism after approving a law that allows the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation in rare circumstances, primarily for land reform. The law has drawn opposition from US President Donald Trump and local political parties, who view it as threatening property rights. Ramaphosa's government maintains that compensation will be paid in most cases and that the changes are necessary to increase black ownership of land, and the law is not aimed at rural land or farmland specifically, and could include land in urban areas. Legal experts suggest expropriation without compensation would only occur when land is unused or abandoned, with compensation still provided for buildings and natural resources.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete from Southern California, competed in the CIF track-and-field finals, winning first-place medals in high jump and triple jump and placing second in the long jump, amid national scrutiny and protests. The California Interscholastic Federation implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports, and President Trump threatened to pull federal funding from the state if Hernandez competed. Protests and counterprotests occurred at the event, with one arrest made following an altercation.</p>

          <p>Crystal McKinney, who previously sued Sean "Diddy" Combs for sexual assault, has filed an amended lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, accusing him of sexually assaulting her and a friend in 2003. Weinstein's lawyer denies the claims, suggesting they are opportunistic. McKinney alleges that Weinstein plied her and her roommate with alcohol before sexually assaulting them in a hotel room. In her lawsuit against Diddy, McKinney claims she was drugged and sexually assaulted at his studio in 2003, leading to a decline in her modeling career and subsequent mental health issues. Diddy is currently on trial for sex crimes and racketeering, while Weinstein faces a retrial after his 2020 conviction was overturned.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon, stating that it contributes to a false narrative. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons are inappropriate and damage Americans' views of the federal government. She has sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought pardons and used them in court. She expects her protest to garner attention from President Trump, and she has sparred with other Jan. 6 defendants over the riot's whitewashing.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is fighting to correct what he believes was a "robbery" of his military pension, an issue he has been pursuing since the 1980s. Williams claims he was unfairly discharged in 1970, missing out on a substantially improved pension that was introduced in 1972. Despite numerous appeals, the Ministry of Defence maintains that his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time. Williams' case is similar to other veterans who missed out on pension benefits due to rule changes, and he hopes that by speaking out, he can bring attention to his case and find others affected by the same issue.</p>

He points to various sectors, including tech, retail, and pharmaceuticals, where companies are facing challenges due to tariff policies and regulatory uncertainty. Cramer suggests that the administration's actions are creating instability and discouraging investment in American companies. He notes that the lack of predictability is driving investors to other markets, such as Europe, despite the strong performance of many U.S. companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The leading opposition candidate, Lee Jae-myung, has been campaigning in a bullet-proof vest due to death threats and a credible assassination plot. This election is seen as an opportunity to steer South Korea back onto safer, more stable ground and heal the fractures caused by the crisis. Lee is portraying himself as the only candidate who can prevent a recurrence of martial law, while his rival, Kim Moon-soo, has struggled to gain traction due to his association with the disgraced former president.</p>

The shortage is impacting over 61,000 patients in the UK, and some are skipping meals to ration their medication, according to the National Pharmacy Association (NPA). Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which reduces their ability to cope with treatment. The Department of Health and Social Care says there are European-wide supply issues and it is working to mitigate the impact on patients.

Ukrainian security sources claim the attack, called "Operation Spider's Web," took over a year and a half to execute and was supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, and the Security Service of Ukraine estimates damages at $7 billion. The attack comes as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site, and Zelenskyy is sending a delegation to Istanbul for talks with Russian representatives, prioritizing a ceasefire and the return of prisoners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study predicts that Earth's atmosphere will eventually revert to a state rich in methane and low in oxygen, likely within a billion years. This shift will return the planet to conditions similar to those before the Great Oxidation Event, making it uninhabitable for humans and most other life forms that rely on oxygen. Researchers ran detailed models of Earth's biosphere, factoring in changes in the brightness of the Sun and the corresponding drop in carbon dioxide levels. Less carbon dioxide means fewer photosynthesizing organisms such as plants, which would result in less oxygen. The study suggests that oxygen-rich atmospheres may not be a permanent feature of habitable worlds, impacting the search for life beyond Earth.</p>
