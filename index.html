          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance has warned of severe job cuts if the ongoing government shutdown is not swiftly resolved, with thousands of federal employees already on unpaid leave. Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked over the budget, with Democrats insisting on extending federal health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, a demand rejected by Republicans. The Trump administration previously announced layoffs across seven agencies, including the CDC, though some notices were later rescinded. Essential workers, such as federal law enforcement and air traffic controllers, continue to work without pay, while military personnel are being paid through redirected funds. The article highlights the growing impact on government services, including the closure of Smithsonian museums, as lawmakers struggle to find a resolution.</p>

          <p>A shooting incident at a crowded bar on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, resulted in at least four fatalities and 20 injuries early Sunday morning. Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office deputies responded to Willie’s Bar and Grill, finding numerous gunshot victims and a large crowd fleeing the scene. The preliminary investigation indicates hundreds were present when the gunfire erupted, causing many to seek refuge in nearby businesses and homes. Authorities have not yet released the names of the deceased or identified any suspects, with the circumstances leading to the violence remaining under active investigation. The sheriff’s office described the event as tragic and difficult, urging patience from the public.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has written to the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, demanding answers regarding the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry were dropped after the Director of Public Prosecutions stated that evidence referring to China as a national security threat could not be obtained from the government. Badenoch criticized the government's shifting narrative and accused them of weakness towards Beijing, raising questions about the involvement of Starmer's national security advisor. The opposition leader highlighted the importance of the matter, citing alleged spying on Members of Parliament and the need for clarity on the government's handling of national security intelligence. The article notes that the Conservatives have submitted an urgent parliamentary question, seeking a ministerial explanation for the trial's failure.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance confirmed that the Trump administration is 'looking at all options,' including invoking the Insurrection Act, to deploy military troops on US soil to quell domestic unrest. Vance's remarks came amid legal challenges to the administration's attempts to use federal National Guard forces in Democratic-run cities like Chicago. The Insurrection Act, last used in 1992, permits presidential deployment of military forces domestically in cases of insurrection or rebellion. Vance argued such measures are necessary due to perceived rampant crime in cities, despite evidence showing falling violent crime rates. The article highlights escalating tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic state leaders, with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accusing Vance of 'tidal wave of lies' and dismissing veiled threats of prosecution. This situation underscores a contentious debate over federal authority and states' rights.</p>

          <h2>China Accuses US of 'Double Standards' Over Tariff Threats and Rare Earth Curbs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's government has accused the US of 'double standards' after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, warning of unspecified 'countermeasures' if implemented. A commerce ministry spokesperson stated China is 'not afraid' of a trade war, criticizing US export restrictions on chips while defending its own tightening of rare earths export controls as necessary for national security. Trump later softened his tone, suggesting 'Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!' and that President Xi Jinping 'just had a bad moment.' The article highlights the renewed fears of a trade war, which previously saw both sides agree to drop triple-digit tariffs. This diplomatic exchange is seen by some as a tactic to strengthen positions ahead of potential future trade talks. China processes approximately 90% of the world's rare earths, critical for advanced technology.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology company Wingtech has reported that control of its Dutch subsidiary, Nexperia, a semiconductor manufacturer, has been effectively frozen by a Dutch court and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This intervention, cited for 'national security' reasons, aims to prevent a situation where Nexperia's crucial technological knowledge and capabilities could become unavailable in an emergency, posing a risk to Dutch and European economic security, particularly in the automotive sector. Wingtech's initial WeChat post, later deleted, lashed out at the Dutch move. The article highlights a growing trend of Western governments scrutinizing Chinese investments in sensitive technology sectors, reflecting heightened geopolitical tensions. This incident could further strain China's relations with the European Union. The Dutch government confirmed its action was due to 'serious governance shortcomings' within Nexperia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, drawing on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, identifies seven toxic habits that prevent children from developing mental strength. These include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection, silencing big feelings, prizing achievement above all, hoarding power, making kids responsible for parental emotions, and glorifying burnout. Instead, the article advocates for allowing children to face age-appropriate challenges, apologizing for parental mistakes, validating their emotions, and emphasizing effort over outcomes. It also stresses the importance of giving children a voice in decisions, managing one's own emotional regulation, and demonstrating the value of rest. The article suggests that mental strength is built through helping children navigate difficulties, feel their emotions, take ownership, and prioritize self-care while feeling unconditionally loved.

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced an attempt to illegally seize power, hours before an army unit, CAPSAT, claimed control of all armed forces. CAPSAT, which was instrumental in Rajoelina's 2009 rise to power, has now condemned the use of force against protesters and joined demonstrations. Youth-led protests, initially against water and power cuts, have escalated into widespread dissatisfaction over unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis. Rajoelina, whose whereabouts are unclear, condemned the destabilization attempt and called for national unity. The article reports clashes and a soldier's death, with Air France suspending flights due to the security situation. The African Union has expressed deep concern, urging dialogue to resolve the crisis in one of the world's poorest nations. This situation marks the biggest challenge to Rajoelina since his 2023 re-election. The protest movement, Gen Z Mada, has garnered significant support through social media.</p>
