          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine to be held in Istanbul on May 15th, hours after European leaders urged Moscow to agree to a 30-day ceasefire. Putin stated that Russia is seeking serious negotiations aimed at achieving a lasting peace, but did not directly address the ceasefire demands. European leaders, including representatives from the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, had visited Kyiv to pressure Russia to commit to an unconditional ceasefire, warning of new sanctions if Putin did not agree. The Ukrainian capital played host to the European leaders, who reaffirmed their support for Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Ree Drummond, star of "Pioneer Woman", has recommitted to her health journey after gaining weight due to a year-long break from her previous regimen. Drummond shared that she stopped exercising and paying attention to her diet at the end of 2023, leading to weight gain. She has now returned to a plan similar to the one she successfully used in 2021, focusing on building muscle through exercises like lunges and squats, and increasing her protein intake. Drummond also mentioned that she is no longer weighing her food or counting calories, relying on the awareness she gained from her previous efforts.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions arising from the trade war initiated by President Trump. The discussions, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, carry significant implications for the global economy, which has been destabilized by tariffs imposed by both nations. While Trump hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a swift resolution. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices, while China maintains it will not make concessions in response to tariffs.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece for the New York Times, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should embrace their flaws rather than strive for perfection. She contends that being a flawed mother is essential for children to learn to accept their own imperfections and understand the give-and-take nature of relationships. Ross criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to stop wondering if they are good enough, asserting that they already are.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has voted to reinstate Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership had sought to replace Kim, believing Han had a better chance of winning the upcoming elections. Kim, a former labor activist, denounced the attempt as a political coup and thanked his supporters for their support. The PPP has been in turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, and the opposition Democratic Party's candidate, Lee Jae-myung, is currently leading in the polls.</p>

Putin stated Russia was prepared for serious negotiations without preconditions, aiming to eliminate the root causes of the conflict, but did not directly address the European cease-fire proposal. The European leaders coordinated their efforts with President Trump, who signaled support for sanctions absent a cease-fire.

Harry's comments, made in a BBC interview, have drawn attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles can heal the rift with Harry, it could define his reign and undercut his messages of tolerance and inclusiveness.

          <p>President Trump has floated the idea of renaming the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf, a move that has united Iranians across the political spectrum in opposition. The Persian Gulf has been known by that name since at least 550 B.C., and Iranians view it as a core part of their national identity. Trump's suggestion has been condemned by Iranian government officials, analysts, and even opposition figures, who see it as an insult to Iranian history and culture. The proposal comes ahead of Trump's trip to the Middle East and amid ongoing negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States and China have made "great progress" in high-level trade talks held in Geneva, describing the discussions as constructive and a "total reset." The meeting, the first face-to-face contact between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since the United States significantly increased tariffs on Chinese goods, aimed to defuse trade tensions between the two countries. Trump expressed a desire to see China open up to American business, but provided no specific details about the discussions. U.S. officials have indicated that further rounds of talks are expected.</p>

The museum, located in a U.S. town accessible only through Canada, has seen a significant drop in Canadian visitors due to President Trump's trade policies and rhetoric. Owners Neil and Krystal King are moving the museum across the border to avoid the 145% tariffs on their Chinese-made ducks and to escape the uncertainty of international diplomacy, despite still calling Point Roberts their home.</p>

Ozturk, who was detained for over six weeks, spoke at a news conference alongside Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, expressing gratitude for the support she received. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was taken into custody.
