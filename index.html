          <p>According to the latest Henley Passport Index, Singapore once again holds the world's most powerful passport, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries. The 2025 ranking highlights a continued shift in global mobility, with Asian nations like Japan and South Korea also placing near the top. In contrast, the passports of the United States and the United Kingdom have continued their downward trend, falling to 10th and 6th place, respectively. The index assesses passport strength based on the number of destinations accessible without a prior visa.</p>

          <p>In response to new U.S. tariffs targeting transshipments, Chinese firms are being encouraged to deepen their economic roots within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The U.S. has warned that goods diverted through countries like Vietnam to circumvent tariffs on China will face steep levies. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office advised that Chinese companies should become more integrated with local economies. This strategy would help them navigate unpredictable trade policies and build more resilient, long-term business operations in the region.</p>

          <p>A preliminary autopsy has determined that 9-year-old Canadian Melina Galanis Frattolin died from asphyxia due to drowning, with her death officially ruled a homicide by New York State Police. Her father, Luciano Frattolin, has been charged with second-degree murder after allegedly fabricating a kidnapping story. The investigation revealed the pair crossed into the U.S. for a vacation, but authorities found no evidence to support the father's abduction claims. Melina's body was discovered in a pond less than a day after he reported her missing.</p>

          <p>One month after deadly Israeli airstrikes hit Iran's notorious Evin Prison, transferred detainees are reporting inhumane and unbearable conditions in other facilities. Accounts from family members describe severe overcrowding, a lack of beds and air conditioning, poor sanitation, and insect infestations. Amnesty International has labeled the initial attack a potential war crime, which Israel defended by claiming the prison was used for intelligence operations against it. The reports highlight a dire human rights situation for the prisoners.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will implement a "low double-digit" price increase across its candy portfolio to combat the soaring cost of cocoa. The company stated the change is a direct reflection of unprecedented ingredient costs, not trade policies. Global cocoa prices have skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa caused by adverse weather and crop diseases. In response, Hershey is also strategically shifting focus toward products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its broader snacking powerhouse vision.</p>

The article points to the recent removal of several high-ranking female officers, including the first female superintendent of the Naval Academy, as evidence of this pattern. It connects these actions to the stated views of the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, regarding women in the armed forces, suggesting a mission to roll back gender integration at the highest levels.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges has declined to permanently appoint Alina Habba, a personal lawyer for Donald Trump, as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, effectively ending her interim role. The decision is a rare judicial rebuke and follows strong opposition from New Jersey's two Democratic senators, who argued she had politicized the office and lacked prosecutorial experience. In a subsequent move, the Justice Department announced it had also removed the career prosecutor the court had selected to replace Habba.</p>

This move escalates a political firestorm surrounding the Trump administration's refusal to release its remaining files on the Epstein case.
