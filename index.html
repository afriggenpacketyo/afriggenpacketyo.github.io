          <p>The U.S. Senate is currently in a prolonged voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," to pass President Trump's sweeping budget legislation. The bill, which includes significant tax break extensions, defense spending increases, and deep cuts to welfare and healthcare programs, faces a precarious path to approval. Republican leadership is struggling to secure enough votes, as internal party divisions and criticism from figures like Elon Musk threaten its passage. The legislation's approval is uncertain, with the outcome depending on a few holdout senators and the potential for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President.</p>

          <p>In Far West Texas, a collaborative effort is underway to protect one of the world's largest 'dark sky reserves' from the growing threat of light pollution. The McDonald Observatory, a hub for both astronomical research and tourism, has spearheaded initiatives with local cities, counties, and even oil and gas companies to adopt dark-sky-friendly lighting. This 15,000-square-mile reserve is crucial not only for scientific study but also for the local economy and wildlife. As light pollution increases globally, this region's success in preserving its natural nighttime environment serves as a model for conservation and maintaining a connection to the cosmos.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's budget bill proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, potentially leaving millions of Americans without health insurance and threatening the stability of rural healthcare facilities. The Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured individuals by 11.8 million by 2034. A key provision imposes new work requirements on recipients, which experts from the UC Berkeley Labor Center warn could disproportionately harm older adults who face barriers to employment. Healthcare advocates also express concern that the drastic funding cuts could force the closure of rural hospitals and clinics that rely heavily on Medicaid revenue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polls from various outlets indicate that a majority of Americans oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," but public opinion is more divided on its specific components. Surveys from Quinnipiac, Fox News, and Pew show overall opposition ranging from 55% to 59%, with strong partisan splits. However, when asked about individual provisions, such as imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, voters are nearly evenly split. Similarly, support for extending tax cuts from the 2017 law is higher when framed for lower-income individuals. The data suggests that while the overall package is unpopular, the public holds more nuanced views on its specific policy changes.</p>

He specifically called out the conservative House Freedom Caucus for supporting what he termed a "DEBT SLAVERY bill." This public opposition marks a renewed clash between Musk and the Trump administration, which began when the billionaire departed his role in the administration while criticizing the bill.</p>

Those detained include members of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the city's former mayor, Tunc Soyer. The CHP has condemned the dawn arrests as a politically motivated move, drawing parallels to the recent arrest of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Opposition figures claim the detentions are part of a broader crackdown on dissent by President Erdogan's government, which is using the judiciary to target political rivals, a charge the government denies.</p>

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone increased slightly to 2% in June, aligning perfectly with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in months. The data from Eurostat met economists' expectations, following a period of fluctuating rates across major European economies. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like energy and food, remained steady at 2.3%, while the closely monitored services inflation saw a minor uptick. Following the announcement, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane suggested that the central bank's cycle of interventions to control peak inflation is likely complete, signaling a potential stabilization of monetary policy in the near future.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant monthly drop since February 2023. This decline is partly attributed to weaker demand following April's changes to stamp duty, which reduced tax relief for many homebuyers. Despite the monthly fall, annual price growth stood at 2.1%, though this represents the slowest yearly increase in nearly a year. Economists suggest this market softness may be temporary, anticipating that supportive factors like low unemployment, earnings growth outpacing inflation, and potential future interest rate cuts from the Bank of England will help stabilize activity.

Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts only a minor additional drop in October and notes that prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Regulator Ofgem is encouraging consumers to consider fixed-rate deals for more payment certainty and has provisionally approved a Â£24 billion investment to upgrade UK energy infrastructure, aiming for a more stable system in the long run.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has altered its controversial welfare reform bill after facing a potential rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. The changes offer greater protection for existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Universal Credit health benefits, shielding them from stricter new eligibility rules and ensuring their payments rise with inflation. However, new applicants after November 2026 will face significantly tougher criteria and lower payment rates, a move critics argue creates an unfair 'two-tier' system. While the concessions protect millions from immediate financial loss, disability charities argue the reforms were made without consultation and will harm future claimants.</p>

Churchill Downs was the setting for his seminal 1970 article on the Kentucky Derby, which gave birth to his signature "Gonzo journalism" style. Early in his career, The Courier Journal published his more traditional freelance work, offering a glimpse of his developing voice. The Louisville Free Public Library, where his mother worked, and the nearby Cherokee Park were formative spaces during his youth, fostering his love for literature and serving as the backdrop for a pivotal arrest that altered the course of his life.</p>

Paetongtarn, who will remain in the cabinet as culture minister, is the third member of the powerful Shinawatra political clan to face removal from power.

The Republican primary is already contentious, featuring a challenge by Attorney General Ken Paxton against incumbent Sen. John Cornyn. While Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994, they hope that shifting suburban demographics and a potentially divisive GOP primary could create a path to victory in the increasingly competitive state.</p>

          <p>A new research report published in The Lancet medical journal projects that the Trump administration's decision to cut over 80% of U.S. foreign humanitarian aid funding could lead to more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030. The study highlights that these cuts risk reversing two decades of health progress in low- and middle-income countries, with a third of the potential premature deaths being among children under five. The U.S., historically the world's largest aid provider, has significantly reduced its contributions, prompting other nations to follow suit and creating what the UN calls the deepest funding crisis ever for the humanitarian sector.</p>

          <h2>Conservative Commentator Argues NYC Socialist Victory Is a Warning to Right-Wing Populism</h2>

          <p>In an opinion piece for Fox News, a conservative commentator argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary serves as a dire warning for the American right. The author contends that when right-wing populism embraces state power and economic interventions, it cedes the ideological ground to left-wing populists who will always promise more. The article suggests that by moving away from traditional conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise, the right creates an environment where radical socialist policies like price controls and wealth taxes become more palatable, ultimately paving the way for candidates like Mamdani to succeed.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has appointed Chen Xiaojiang as the new party secretary for the Xinjiang region, a strategically important and sensitive area. Chen, 63, previously served as the executive deputy minister of the United Front Work Department, the party organ responsible for managing relations with non-party groups, including ethnic and religious organizations. This high-profile appointment could position Chen for further advancement within the party's hierarchy, as the Xinjiang party chief traditionally holds a seat on the powerful 24-member Politburo. The move signals a key leadership change in a region under intense international scrutiny for its human rights record.</p>

In-person voting saw a resurgence, with a majority of ballots cast either on Election Day or during the early voting period.

These findings reflect a period of deep national polarization and low confidence in political leadership, with President Trump holding a 43% approval rating and congressional Democrats receiving their lowest approval score in seven years.

In California, a bill is advancing that would require physicians to complete coursework on menopause to renew their licenses. This is part of a national trend, with 13 states introducing legislation this year to improve menopause-related care and education for both providers and patients. Experts note that less than a third of OB-GYN residency programs offer dedicated menopause training, leaving many doctors ill-equipped to treat common symptoms like hot flashes, mood changes, and cognitive issues.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board has warned that President Donald Trump's recent attacks on Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) could be a self-sabotaging move that puts his presidency at risk. The criticism came after Tillis, who has been critical of Trump's budget bill, announced he would not seek reelection in 2026. The Journal's board argues that Trump has a habit of undermining his own political success and that turning Tillis's seat into a competitive race creates an unnecessary pickup opportunity for Democrats. They conclude that losing the Senate in 2026 would render the Trump presidency "dead in the water."</p>

          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza on Monday resulted in at least 74 Palestinian deaths, according to health officials and witnesses. One airstrike hit a crowded seaside cafe in Gaza City, killing at least 30 people, including women and children. In separate incidents, Israeli forces reportedly opened fire on Palestinians attempting to access food aid, killing at least 23 people near distribution sites in southern and northern Gaza. The Israeli military stated it was reviewing the attacks, part of an intensified bombardment campaign across northern Gaza that has made many areas inaccessible for emergency services trying to reach the wounded.</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal achieved a historic 4-3 victory over English Premier League champions Manchester City in a thrilling Club World Cup match in Florida. The stunning upset marks the first time an Asian club has defeated a European side in an official FIFA tournament. Despite being without key players, Al-Hilal twice came from behind before a late winner from Marcos Leonardo secured the win. The result is seen as a significant moment for Saudi football, which has invested heavily to grow its global profile, and ends Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's previously perfect winning record in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Gemma Grainger, the head coach of Norway's women's national team, is the sole English manager at the Euro 2025 tournament. The 42-year-old from Middlesbrough, who previously coached Wales, has spent the last 18 months instilling a new, holistic culture in the Norwegian squad, focusing on player empowerment and open communication. Once a powerhouse in women's football, Norway has struggled in recent tournaments, but players like captain Ada Hegerberg have praised Grainger's empathetic and intelligent approach. Grainger aims to guide the team out of a competitive group stage, repaying the faith the Norwegian federation has placed in her.</p>
