          <p>Tesla has launched new, more affordable versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, with the Model Y standard priced just under $40,000. This move aims to attract buyers following the expiration of $7,500 federal EV tax credits and increased competition. Despite the company's efforts to boost sales with these new offerings, Tesla's stock experienced a decline. Investors were reportedly underwhelmed, having hoped for updates on other long-promised products like the next-generation Roadster.</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7th Hamas attacks, a survivor, Aviva Siegel, shared her harrowing 51-day experience as a hostage in Gaza. She described being shot during her kidnapping, enduring torture, starvation, and multiple transfers while her husband, Keith, was held for over 400 days. The attacks resulted in over 1,200 Israeli deaths and 251 hostages, with 48 still believed to be in Gaza, 20 of whom are thought to be alive. This personal testimony highlights the enduring trauma and ongoing hostage crisis.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell stated that while demand for computing power remains "tremendous," the proliferation of artificial intelligence data centers will eventually reach a saturation point. Despite this long-term outlook, he currently sees no immediate signs of overbuilding in the sector. Dell's server networking business has shown significant growth, leveraging Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra chips to supply customers like CoreWeave and xAI. The company's stock rose after it increased its expected long-term revenue and profit growth targets.</p>

          <p>New research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that inhalers for asthma and COPD contributed an estimated 24.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in the U.S. over the past decade. This amount is comparable to the annual emissions of approximately 530,000 gas-powered cars. Metered-dose inhalers, which use potent hydrofluoroalkane propellants, are the primary culprits. The study emphasizes the need for lower-emission alternatives to protect both patient health and the environment, as climate change exacerbates respiratory conditions.</p>

          <p>Israelis across the country marked two years since the October 7th Hamas attack, which killed over 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, as negotiations for a Gaza peace plan continued in Egypt. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to achieve war goals, including the return of all hostages and the elimination of Hamas. Meanwhile, the UN Secretary General called for agreement on President Donald Trump's peace plan. The ongoing conflict has reportedly killed over 67,000 people in Gaza, with intense Israeli bombardment continuing amidst difficult talks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a substantial increase in trash collection fees for many residents, aiming to address a severe fiscal crisis and a nearly $1-billion budget deficit. The city's trash program had been heavily subsidized for 17 years, incurring costs of $500,000 daily, which became unsustainable. Once implemented in mid-November, fees for single-family homes and smaller apartments will more than double or increase by approximately 50%, with further annual increases planned. This hike comes as residents already contend with rising living costs, drawing criticism from some council members and community groups.</p>

          <p>Democrats and a federal workers union are initiating legal challenges against the Trump administration for using politically charged language like "the Radical Left Democrat Shutdown" on federal websites and in government emails. They argue this partisan messaging violates the 1939 Hatch Act, which prohibits executive branch employees from engaging in partisan activities at work. A complaint filed with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel highlights concerns about politicizing public infrastructure. Retired federal land managers also expressed that such language casts a chilling effect on civil servants.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has issued a memo instructing U.S. intelligence agencies to review the feasibility of random polygraph examinations and intensify efforts to curb information leaks to the press. The directive emphasizes incorporating leak-related questions into standard security clearance polygraphs, reinforcing existing regulations. While officials state it doesn't establish new policies, critics argue it could create a chilling effect on whistleblowers and press freedoms. The move reflects the Trump administration's hard-line stance against unauthorized disclosures, citing potential damage to national security and alliances.</p>

          <p>UFC fighter Conor McGregor has accepted an 18-month ban for violating the organization's anti-doping policy, specifically missing three attempted biological sample collections in 2024. The ban, reduced from 24 months due to his cooperation, began on September 20, 2024, and will conclude in March 2026. This comes as McGregor recently claimed to have signed for a UFC fight in June 2026, a claim denied by UFC president Dana White. The article also notes that McGregor was previously ordered to pay damages in November 2024 for a sexual assault allegation from 2018.</p>

          <p>Amgen is the latest pharmaceutical company to launch a direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales model, offering its cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha at a 60% discount. This trend, also adopted by Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer, aligns with President Donald Trump's push to lower U.S. drug prices and bypass intermediaries like pharmacy benefit managers. Trump's administration has urged drugmakers to curb costs and is launching a website, TrumpRx.gov, for discounted direct purchases. The move aims to increase access and affordability for patients, with Medicare drug price negotiations also playing a role in the broader effort. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, investors are observing the stock market's reaction, with the S&P 500 showing resilience and even new highs. Historically, government shutdowns have rarely derailed equities, with the S&P 500 often experiencing gains during and after such periods. Experts advise investors to temper reactions to headlines and remain invested, as diversification typically outperforms reactive trading during political gridlock. While not universally positive, past data suggests that markets are forward-looking and tend to price in future conditions rather than immediate political noise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six former U.S. Surgeons General from both Republican and Democratic administrations have issued a joint warning that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies are "endangering the health of the nation." They criticize changes in vaccine policy, cuts to mRNA vaccine research, and a shift from science to ideology, leading to plummeting morale at health agencies. Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, which includes narrowing Covid-19 vaccine eligibility, is seen as undermining public health foundations. The former officials assert that Kennedy has "rejected science, misled the public and compromised the health of Americans."</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown persists, Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins, are facing increasing pressure to consider Democratic demands for an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. While Collins has circulated a proposal, she insists on negotiating the subsidies after the government reopens, a stance rejected by most Democrats who want the extension codified immediately. The subsidies, set to expire at year-end, are a key sticking point, with Democrats arguing against losing leverage if they agree to reopen the government first.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for car finance mis-selling, potentially leading to payouts for 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024. The scandal stems from "discretionary commission arrangements" where dealers received undisclosed commissions based on customer interest rates, incentivizing higher charges. The FCA expects average payouts of £700 per mis-sold agreement, totaling an estimated £8.2 billion. While a Supreme Court ruling narrowed the scope, lenders have already set aside over £2 billion for potential redress, with the scheme expected to be operational by early next year.
