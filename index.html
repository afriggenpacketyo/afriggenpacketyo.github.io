          <p>As of May 7, 2025, the REAL ID Act is officially in effect, requiring travelers to present a REAL ID-compliant driver's license, passport, or other approved identification to board domestic flights and enter federal facilities. The new regulations, stemming from the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, aim to standardize identification and enhance security. While travelers without a REAL ID may face additional screening, they will still be allowed to fly, according to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.

          <p>For the second time in eight days, a U.S. fighter jet has been lost from the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. An F/A-18F Super Hornet went overboard during a failed landing maneuver, but both pilots ejected safely with minor injuries. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024, including a collision with a merchant vessel and an accidental shoot-down of a fighter jet.</p>

          <p>CD (Certificate of Deposit) interest rates are currently elevated, offering savers an opportunity to secure high returns amidst economic uncertainty.

The article advises savers to consider online banks and short-term CDs to maximize their returns, highlighting the inverted yield curve where short-term CDs offer higher interest rates than longer-term ones. A practical approach is to ladder your CDs, buying some one year, some two years, some three years, etc.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chavín people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs, including DMT, during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including snuff tubes with traces of hallucinogenic substances, at Chavín de Huántar. The rituals, held in hidden rooms, likely involved select members of society, contributing to the creation of early class structures. This is compelling evidence that psychoactive plants were part of formalized and tightly-controlled rituals rather than individual vision-quests or shamanic healing practices.</p>
