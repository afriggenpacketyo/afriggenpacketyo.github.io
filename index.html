          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Leonard Leo, a conservative legal activist who previously advised him on Supreme Court selections, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This attack followed a ruling against Trump's tariffs by a panel of judges, including one appointed by Trump, which cited right-leaning legal theories. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, influenced by Leo, for allegedly providing poor judicial nomination advice. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of federal courts, considering it his most important legacy, amidst Trump's clashes with the judiciary over his policies. The situation highlights growing tensions between Trump and parts of the conservative legal movement. Optimism in this scenario is relatively low, considering the public dispute and potential implications for legal and political alliances.</p>

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly shifting its IPO plans from London to Hong Kong after facing regulatory hurdles in China, signaling increasing challenges for the company. The potential London listing faced scrutiny over forced labor allegations and consumer protection law breaches, including concerns about fake discounts and misleading sustainability claims. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods and potential similar measures in the EU and UK have added to Shein's difficulties. Analysts suggest a Hong Kong listing might be more palatable to a domestic audience given the controversies surrounding the company, as Shein continues to deny forced labor allegations. Given the regulatory and ethical issues, the overall sentiment surrounding Shein's IPO is cautious.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly engaging in mega drug-licensing deals with multinational pharmaceutical companies, driven by cost savings and the desire to avoid selling shares amid depressed valuations. These deals often utilize a "newco structure," combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through newly established corporate entities. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar licensing deals for its drug candidates, causing its shares to surge. This trend reflects a strategic shift in the Chinese biotech industry towards leveraging intellectual property to attract foreign investment and expertise. The increase in such deals suggests growing confidence in Chinese biotech innovation and potential for global partnerships.</p>

This agreement follows technical talks between the two nations and is expected to involve a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese processing facilities. While some restrictions on food imports from specific Japanese prefectures remain, this move is seen as a positive step towards resolving tensions between the two countries. Japanese fishermen and businesses have welcomed the announcement, hoping for a smooth expansion of exports. This development indicates a potential thaw in relations between China and Japan.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal symbolizes a shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the sector. Binance, the world's largest digital assets exchange, has recently formed ties with projects linked to the Trump family, indicating a potential shift in the political landscape surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. The end of the lawsuit suggests a more favorable environment for crypto businesses.</p>

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case involving seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer star Diego Maradona. The decision was made after one of the judges stepped down due to criticism over her participation in a documentary series about the case. The new trial will involve selecting three new judges, effectively restarting the proceedings that began in March. The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death in November 2020, adding a layer of uncertainty to the legal process. The legal setback introduces further delays and complicates the pursuit of justice in this high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that the carbon footprint of the first 15 months of Israel's war on Gaza surpasses the annual emissions of numerous countries, exacerbating the climate crisis. The study estimates the long-term climate cost of destruction and reconstruction in Gaza could exceed 31 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The majority of emissions are attributed to the Israeli military's use of weapons and infrastructure destruction, while Hamas's activities account for a small fraction. The findings highlight the environmental consequences of the conflict, including damage to land, food, and water sources, and call for greater accountability for the climate costs of war and occupation. The research underscores the urgent need to address the environmental impact of armed conflicts.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times reflects on the deportation of Chinese rocket scientist Qian Xuesen in 1955, deeming it a significant error in U.S. Cold War strategy. Qian, who contributed to U.S. aerospace and weaponry advancements, was deported amid McCarthy-era anxieties and subsequently aided China in developing its missile program. The author draws parallels to current U.S. policies targeting foreign students and researchers, cautioning against repeating past mistakes driven by xenophobia. The deportation is viewed as a missed opportunity for the U.S. to maintain scientific dominance and contributed to China's rise as a technological superpower. The piece serves as a cautionary tale about the long-term consequences of exclusionary policies.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist warns that financial sanctions could become a new battleground in the US-China rivalry, but believes full-scale sanctions are unlikely. Lian Ping suggests the U.S. might target specific Chinese entities before expanding to exclude China from the US dollar system. He argues that sanctioning China within the Swift system would harm the system itself, as countries with trade ties to China would shift to China's alternative payment system. This assessment reflects concerns about escalating tensions between the two countries and the potential for financial warfare. The economist's analysis suggests a cautious outlook on the future of US-China financial relations.</p>

          <p>The White House has acknowledged issues in a federal government report led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., titled "Make America Healthy Again." The report, which criticized the U.S. food supply and prescription drugs, cited studies that did not appear to exist or were misinterpreted. The White House press secretary stated that the report will be updated to address formatting and citation errors. Despite the issues, the White House maintains confidence in Kennedy and describes the report as a transformative assessment of chronic disease.

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a temporary pause to a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration had threatened to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on hold. The appeals court's decision provides the administration with some respite as it prepares to argue that the trade court's ruling should be halted for the duration of the appeals process. Trump officials maintain they have alternative options for imposing tariffs if they do not prevail in the case. The legal battle over the tariffs continues to create uncertainty for businesses and international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service between San Diego and Orange counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks affected by landslides and coastal erosion. Crews have placed thousands of tons of boulders and sand along the rail to stabilize the area. The OCTA estimates the total cost of the projects to be about $300 million. The rail line has faced recurring interruptions due to eroding bluffs. The resumption of service is a positive development for commuters and travelers.</p>
