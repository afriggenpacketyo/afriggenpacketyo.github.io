          <p>A BBC reporter recounts his year-long undercover investigation into a violent people-smuggling operation in northern France. Posing as a Syrian refugee named "Abu Ahmed," he navigated the dangerous world of the smugglers' forest camps near Dunkirk, using a hidden camera to gather evidence. The article details the constant risks, the meticulous planning required to maintain his cover story across multiple identities and phones, and the psychological toll of operating within a criminal network. The investigation ultimately led to an arrest in Birmingham, highlighting the effectiveness of such high-risk journalism.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in a Baltimore neighborhood on Saturday night left six people wounded, including a five-year-old girl. According to Police Commissioner Richard Worley, the incident occurred when an unknown suspect opened fire on a group of people who were gathered outside eating crabs. The victims range in age from five to 52, with a 38-year-old man reported to be in critical condition. The five-year-old girl sustained a non-life-threatening injury to her hand, and police are still investigating the incident with little information currently available on a suspect.</p>

          <p>Female refugees in Germany face significant challenges entering the workforce, with unemployment rates much higher than their male counterparts due to a "threefold disadvantage" of being women, immigrants, and refugees. The article highlights systemic issues like childcare shortages, difficulty in getting foreign qualifications recognized, and language barriers that disproportionately affect women, many of whom arrive with children. It profiles several women and the nonprofit organizations like "Work for Refugees" that are helping them overcome these obstacles through counseling, training, and mentorship, aiming to dismantle recruitment hurdles and foster integration.</p>

The Sunday Express notes police are on alert for these and "anti-migrant rallies." Other major stories include the government's proposal to deport foreign criminals immediately after sentencing to save costs. The Mail on Sunday features Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick expressing fears for his daughters' safety due to the small boats crisis, while The Sun on Sunday reports on Liam Gallagher's support for his brother, who denies allegations of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, key European leaders have issued a joint statement emphasizing that any peace negotiations must involve Ukraine. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland, and the European Commission asserted that "the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine." This united front comes amid concerns that Kyiv could be excluded from discussions about its own future, a fear echoed by President Zelenskyy. The statement also stressed that international borders should not be altered by force, pushing back against suggestions of territorial swaps.</p>

As the head of the Communist Party's international liaison department, the 61-year-old has been a prominent figure in China's global diplomacy, meeting with officials from over 160 countries. His detention marks another high-level political upheaval following the ousting of former Foreign Minister Qin Gang last year.</p>

The offense provided strong support, including Shohei Ohtani's 40th home run of the season. With Snell, Tyler Glasnow, and others now healthy and performing well, the team is building significant momentum as it heads towards the postseason.</p>

          <p>A new six-part documentary, "Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang," has been aired by a provincial broadcaster in China, aiming to counter Western perspectives on the region's history. The series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang, framing the action as a reunification effort against foreign-backed invasion. This production aligns with Beijing's broader strategy to "forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation" and solidify its official narrative regarding its borderlands. The documentary portrays the historical separatist leader Yaqub Beg as a jihadist, a view that contrasts with his veneration by some modern Islamic fundamentalist groups.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a renaissance after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant downturn. A combination of factors, including shifting consumer tastes, reduced drinking among younger generations, post-pandemic inflation, and the looming threat of global trade tariffs have slowed sales growth dramatically. The previous boom led to an oversupply as distilleries ramped up production, and now several have filed for bankruptcy or gone into receivership.

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last remaining newspaper hawker in France, is set to be awarded the National Order of Merit, one of the country's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in Paris's Left Bank, selling papers on the streets of Saint-Germain. He has witnessed the decline of his trade from a thriving community of hawkers to being the sole survivor in the digital age, yet he continues for the joy and independence of the job. President Emmanuel Macron, who once bought papers from him as a student, will present the award.</p>

          <h2>Mark Cuban's Prediction of Tariff-Blamed Price Hikes on Consumer Goods Comes to Fruition</h2>

          <p>Four months after billionaire Mark Cuban advised consumers to stock up on basic goods, his prediction that companies would raise prices and blame it on tariffs is proving accurate. Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble announced price increases on products like Tide and Crest, citing the financial impact of tariffs. Other retailers like Walmart have also raised prices on goods primarily made in China, and packaging costs for food and beverages are expected to rise. Cuban's warning highlighted how tariffs would ultimately be passed on to consumers, who are already facing financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Describes Intense AI Talent War as a Bet on a Select Few to Achieve Superintelligence</h2>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the "crazy intense" competition for top AI talent, where tech giants are offering massive compensation packages to a very small pool of engineers. He explained that the industry is betting that a "medium-sized handful of people" possess the unique knowledge to discover the final algorithmic ideas needed to create superintelligence. While companies are focused on poaching a few big names with offers reportedly exceeding $100 million per year, Altman believes the actual pool of capable individuals is much larger, potentially in the tens of thousands, and not limited to the few currently being pursued.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with the prime minister of Qatar in Spain to discuss a new joint Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The framework reportedly includes the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the territory. The meeting comes amid growing international condemnation of Israel's plan for a military takeover of Gaza City, with many nations warning of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe. Meanwhile, families of hostages are pressuring the Israeli government to prioritize a deal, fearing the offensive will endanger those still held captive.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has dismissed the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal negotiated without Kyiv's involvement would result in "dead solutions." In a firm statement, Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not reward Russia by ceding land. His comments reflect deep anxiety in Ukraine and Europe that their interests could be marginalized in a direct U.S.-Russia negotiation. European leaders echoed this sentiment in a joint statement, reaffirming that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's participation.</p>

          <h2>Man Wrongfully Threatened with Legal Action Over Parking Fine Caused by Number Plate Mix-Up</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A man from Leicestershire received a £165 penalty and threats of legal action from a private parking firm after his car was mistaken for another with a nearly identical number plate. Richard Lynn had paid for his parking, but the firm's automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system incorrectly logged his car as having stayed for nine hours, confusing it with a different vehicle. Despite photographic evidence showing two different cars, the company pursued the fine aggressively. The case highlights concerns that citizens may be intimidated into paying incorrect fines due to flawed automated systems and a lack of human oversight.</p>
