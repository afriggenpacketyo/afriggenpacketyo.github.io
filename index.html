          <h2>German Chancellor's Budget Speech Prioritizes Defense and Economy, Omitting Climate Change</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a contentious budget debate, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended his government's performance, emphasizing priorities in defense, the economy, and migration while notably omitting any mention of climate change. Merz clashed with far-right AfD leader Alice Weidel, who accused him of breaking promises, but he countered by highlighting his leadership on European security and vowing to solve the migration issue. He expressed hope for a trade deal with the U.S. to avoid auto tariffs and committed to a major increase in defense spending. The absence of climate change from his speech drew sharp criticism from the Green party, underscoring a clear shift in the government's immediate focus.</p>

          <h2>German Supermarket Lidl Ordered to Pay €43 Million to French Rival for Deceptive Advertising</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 13:57:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Paris appeals court has ordered the German discount supermarket chain Lidl to pay €43 million in damages to its French competitor, Intermarche. The court ruled that numerous Lidl television advertisements between 2017 and 2023 constituted unfair competitive practices through deceptive advertising. The promotions were found to be misleading because Lidl failed to ensure the advertised products were available at the stated prices across all its stores for a required 15-week period. The court determined that this knowledge elevated the issue from simple deceptive practice to unfair competition, justifying the substantial compensation payment to its rival.</p>

          <p>Beijing has dismissed allegations from the German government that a Chinese naval vessel aimed a military-grade laser at a German reconnaissance aircraft over the Red Sea. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman stated that Germany's information did not align with the facts known to China, asserting that their naval vessels were conducting escort duties to ensure the safety of international shipping lanes. The alleged incident, which reportedly occurred on July 2, prompted Germany to summon the Chinese ambassador. The German aircraft was part of the EU's ASPIDES mission to protect merchant ships from Houthi attacks and was forced to abort its mission.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Police Commissioner, Uli Grötsch, has publicly criticized the government's policy of turning back migrants at the border, highlighting its questionable legality under EU law and the immense strain it places on police forces. Grötsch noted that the directive remains in place despite a German court ruling against it, creating confusion and contradicting his understanding of the rule of law. He emphasized that the intensified border controls have led to significant overtime for the 14,000 officers deployed, impacting their regular duties elsewhere. The policy was introduced by the new conservative-led coalition, prompting retaliatory border checks from Poland.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by announcing it will issue administrative subpoenas for information regarding the institution's foreign students. The Department of Homeland Security stated the request is related to Harvard's certification to enroll international students, accusing the university of allowing visa abuse and advocacy for terrorism. This action follows a previous demand for records and a lawsuit from Harvard after the administration attempted to revoke its ability to enroll foreign students. Concurrently, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services have threatened Harvard's accreditation over alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>According to a new report based on audio recordings, former President Donald Trump claimed at a 2024 donor meeting that he had threatened to "bomb the s--- out of Moscow" to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. In the same meeting, Trump also alleged he made similar threats to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding a potential invasion of Taiwan. The audio reveals Trump recounting Putin's disbelief, but suggesting the Russian leader believed him "10%." A White House spokesperson responded by stating that Russia never invaded Ukraine during Trump's first term, attributing this to his "peace through strength" leadership.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis examines the various "pull factors" that attract asylum seekers to the UK, particularly those crossing the Channel. While French officials suggest the UK's informal economy is a major draw, data indicates France's informal economy is proportionally larger. The UK has more restrictive policies on legal work for asylum seekers compared to countries like France and Italy. Research from Oxford University's Migration Observatory suggests that the ability to speak English and the presence of family networks are more significant drivers than economic opportunities or welfare benefits. The general perception of the UK as a good place to live, often promoted by smugglers, also plays a crucial role.</p>

A therapist explains that this delayed response is common, as resilient individuals often postpone grieving out of necessity.

Questionable management decisions, such as a costly two-year contract for an underperforming Sergio Perez, and concerns over the future of star driver Max Verstappen, created a rocky environment.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi called the state's policy "deeply unfair" and illegal, vowing to protect equal opportunities for female athletes.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump later this month. He is expected to travel to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire to open a new course, though an official confirmation has not yet been made. The visit would be a significant policing operation, and First Minister John Swinney has been briefed on the plans. Trump's last presidential visit in 2018 sparked major protests and incurred millions in policing costs, a point of criticism for some politicians who hope this visit will not leave Police Scotland out of pocket.</p>

Hired by Elon Musk in 2023 to help stabilize the company and bring back advertisers, Yaccarino's role was often seen as secondary to Musk's continued, and often controversial, leadership. In her departure post, she expressed gratitude for the opportunity to work on Musk's vision for an "Everything App." Her exit follows a period of significant change and turmoil for the platform, including a recent controversy involving antisemitic output from Musk's AI chatbot, Grok.</p>

          <p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism for ensuring a Republican spending bill cut funding for weather forecasting just before deadly floods devastated his state. Cruz inserted language into the bill that eliminated $150 million for improving forecasting research and systems at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Critics argue these cuts worsened the disaster's impact, while Cruz, who was vacationing in Greece during the floods, has dismissed the accusations as "partisan finger pointing." The Trump administration has also rejected claims that a short-staffed National Weather Service contributed to the inadequate warnings for the catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is hosting the leaders of five African nations—Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal—for a three-day summit focused on commercial opportunities. The meeting reflects the administration's "trade, not aid" policy, with discussions likely to cover critical minerals, maritime security, and migration, as all invited nations face 10% U.S. tariffs. The choice of guests, who do not represent the continent's major economies, signals a strategic U.S. focus on competing with China and Russia for resources. Analysts suggest the talks will be transactional, with potential deals hinging on issues like migration control and access to strategic minerals.</p>

          <p>Russia's summer military offensive in Ukraine is concentrated on three main fronts, resulting in its largest land grab this year, though progress remains slow against fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces are pushing in the northeastern Sumy region to create a buffer zone, attacking the strategic eastern cities of Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka, and advancing west of Pokrovsk. They rely on relentless attacks by small infantry groups, a "creeping offensive" tactic that incurs heavy casualties, estimated at over 1,000 soldiers per day. The strategy appears aimed at stretching Ukrainian forces thin and cutting key supply routes in the east.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump makes significant changes to the federal student loan system, which could make higher education more expensive and harder to access for many. The law simplifies repayment by reducing options to just two plans but eliminates programs like the income-driven SAVE plan, potentially leading to higher monthly payments for low-income borrowers. It also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees, which may not cover the full cost of programs like medical or law school. Critics warn this could push students toward private lenders with higher interest rates or create a barrier to obtaining advanced degrees. (not investment advice)</p>
