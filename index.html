          <p>Following a shaky ceasefire brokered by President Trump between Iran and Israel, residents across the Middle East are experiencing a mix of anxiety, frustration, and hope. The ceasefire came after escalating tensions, including Iranian missile strikes on a U.S. air base in Qatar and unprecedented U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. People in the region expressed concerns about the potential for further conflict and the impact on their daily lives, with some viewing the situation as a choreographed show and others fearing an unraveling of regional stability. Many expressed a desire for peace and an end to the constant attacks and destabilization, while others felt that the conflict was contained and wouldn't escalate further. The citizens of the Middle East are hoping that the fragile truce will hold, but are also wary of the future.</p>

          <p>Stock futures rose as investors expressed optimism that the ceasefire between Iran and Israel would hold.

Oil prices decreased as tensions eased, with U.S. benchmark crude and Brent crude both falling, although prices had initially spiked after the conflict began.

          <p>Oil prices fell as President Trump demanded that both Iran and Israel adhere to the ceasefire agreement, accusing them of violations. Brent crude and U.S. crude oil both experienced declines, reversing gains made earlier in June due to the conflict. The easing of tensions reduced concerns about supply disruptions, particularly the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Analysts at Barclays noted that oil prices came under pressure as the threat of a wider regional conflict did not materialize, despite U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear sites (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the chance to challenge their removal based on potential torture or death in their home countries. The ruling lifted an injunction issued by a federal District Court, with the Supreme Court's liberal justices dissenting. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the decision, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants criticized it, saying it strips away critical due process protections. Justice Sotomayor wrote a scathing dissent, citing instances where the government wrongfully deported individuals to unsafe countries despite court orders.</p>

          <p>Increased ICE raids in Los Angeles County are causing fear among immigrant communities, leading many to skip essential activities like doctor's visits. Clinics have seen no-show rates jump as high as 30% as residents prioritize safety over healthcare, with some even sacrificing basic needs to avoid detection. This fear is creating a public health crisis, with conditions like hypertension and diabetes going unmanaged due to missed appointments. While some clinics are offering home visits to mitigate the issue, financial strains are forcing them to consider closing locations and laying off staff.</p>

While the amount of groundwater replenishment was less than the previous year's extremely wet conditions, it still represents a positive step in addressing chronic overpumping in farming areas.

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn higher returns than inflation, with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Current national average CD rates vary by term, but top accounts offer competitive rates, particularly from online banks. Short-term CDs, around six months to one year, often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Strategies like laddering CDs can help savers take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to meet a new NATO target, committing to spend 5% of the UK's GDP on national security by 2035. The commitment, agreed upon at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, allocates 3.5% to core defense and 1.5% to defense-related areas. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the government for announcing the target without new funding, while Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson Helen Maguire supported the increase in spending. The UK government expects to spend 2.6% of GDP on core defence within two years, alongside 1.5% on defence-related areas.</p>
