        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the pharmaceutical giant lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks discussed the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on pharmaceuticals and the company's investments in U.S. manufacturing. Shares of Eli Lilly fell after CVS Health announced Novo Nordisk's Wegovy would be the preferred weight loss medication on its formularies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of May 1, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,228.72 per ounce, influenced by factors like supply and demand, economic conditions, and geopolitical events. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and a hedge against inflation. The price of gold is inversely proportional to interest rates, with lower rates making gold more attractive. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar's strength and investor sentiment also impact gold prices, making it crucial for investors to monitor these factors to make informed decisions.

          <p>President Trump has asserted that new tariffs could lower or eliminate income taxes for most Americans, particularly those earning less than $200,000. However, tax experts argue there is no direct connection between tariffs and lower taxes, as Congress controls the tax code. They contend that tariff revenue would not be sufficient to replace income taxes, and aggressive tariffs could heighten the risk of a recession. Moreover, tariffs disproportionately affect low- and middle-income households, effectively replacing one tax form with another that has unequal distributional effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Seven Key Takeaways from US-Ukraine Resources Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 08:47:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed a deal that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn country's natural resources. The deal sets up an investment fund that Ukraine hopes will cement US assistance as the country struggles to repel Russia three years after the invasion. Trump has previously demanded that Ukraine pay back the $350bn (£264bn) of aid that he claims has been provided by the US during the war - a condition that Zelensky rejected. But Washington appears to have made a concession. The agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons. In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Co-op are being ordered to keep their cameras on during remote work meetings, and verify all attendees, as the company deals with an ongoing cyber attack. The email implies that Co-op is worried about the presence of hackers. The company said it was taking "proactive measures" to fend off the attack which it said had had a "small impact" on its call centre and back office. No internal applications that require a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can be logged into from home and workers are being told to go to a Co-op location if they need to access work tools.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have signed the deal to create the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund -- the long-awaited deal that gives the U.S. rights to Ukrainian rare earth minerals, both sides announced Wednesday. The partnership allows the United States to invest alongside Ukraine to unlock Ukraine's growth assets, mobilize American talent, capital and governance standards that will improve Ukraine's investment climate and accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery. Both sides were ready to sign the agreement on critical minerals and other resources earlier but the U.S. said it wanted the main minerals resources agreement signed and the creation of an investment fund document signed at the same time.</p>

Visa will introduce the "World Visa card" this summer, available only to people who have had their irises scanned by World, and the online dating giant Match Group will begin a pilot program testing out World ID and some age verification tools with Tinder in Japan.</p>

          <p>More than 250 attorneys in the justice department’s civil rights division have either left, been reassigned, or accepted a buyout offer since January. The roughly 70% reduction in attorneys comes as the Trump administration has sought to transform the civil rights division, created in 1957 to enforce US federal civil rights laws. Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump ally who took over the division in April, has made it clear that the focus of the division will be enforcing Trump’s priorities, including hunting for voter fraud, preventing discrimination against white people in college admissions, and limiting the rights of transgender people.</p>

By defunding the U.S. Agency for International Development and rooting out offices dealing with human rights and democracy at the State Department, Trump decimated, almost overnight, a whole government sector focused on defending fundamental principles. Trump seems to want to sweep aside moral concerns not because they preclude the new world order he envisions, but because he believes they are inherently worthless.</p>
