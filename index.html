          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a former commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), plans to challenge his dismissal by President Trump, calling it illegal. Trumka believes his firing was retaliation for opposing the appointment of members from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to the agency. Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the firings, arguing they undermine the independence of the CPSC. Trumka's dismissal is part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration removing officials from independent agencies.</p>
