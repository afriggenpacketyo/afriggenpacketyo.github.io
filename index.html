          <h2>Starmer Floats Youth Mobility Scheme as Part of Potential EU Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 17:50:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia. While Starmer insists this isn't a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, critics like Kemi Badenoch view it as "free movement through the back door." The proposal aims to address gaps in sectors like hospitality and creative industries, but details on eligibility and quotas remain unclear. Universities and students note that Brexit has made studying in the UK less attractive, and this scheme could help reverse that trend.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly rebuked Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would necessitate price increases for consumers. Trump suggested Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" rather than passing costs onto customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey cited unprecedented price increases due to tariffs, despite some relief from earlier levels. Walmart maintains it will try to keep prices low and expects suppliers to absorb some costs. The situation is unfolding as other companies like Microsoft and Mattel also warn of tariff-related price hikes.</p>

This creature, part of the extinct group radiodonts, was about the length of an index finger and had a circular mouth lined with teeth. The discovery reveals that Mosura had a more complex anatomy than previously known for radiodonts, with a multi-segmented abdomen-like region lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods. The findings provide new insights into the diversity of life during the Cambrian period.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland's struggles at Wembley Stadium persist as he failed to score during Manchester City's FA Cup final loss to Crystal Palace. Despite having the chance to equalize from the penalty spot, Haaland surprised spectators by handing the ball to Omar Marmoush, who subsequently missed the penalty. Manager Pep Guardiola indicated the decision was based on player feeling. Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested the occasion may have been too much for Haaland, highlighting the difference between him and players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has criticized Russia for sending a "sham" delegation to peace talks in Istanbul, asserting that real progress requires direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite the official meeting, Zelenskyy believes the representatives lack the authority to make substantive decisions. The primary outcome of the talks was an agreement for a prisoner swap, but broader ceasefire discussions remain stalled. Ukrainian officials have expressed skepticism about Russia's intentions, accusing them of presenting unacceptable demands and ultimatums.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies have faced resistance from federal courts, which have emphasized the importance of due process for immigrants. Courts have consistently ruled that immigrants must have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, especially when the administration claims novel and extraordinary powers. The Supreme Court recently chided the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Legal scholars have hailed the courts' support of due process, while expressing concern that such support was necessary in the first place.</p>
