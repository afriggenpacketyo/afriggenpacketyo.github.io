          <h2>Trump Remittance Tax Could Negatively Impact African Economies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 00:48:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tax bill in the United States includes a proposed 3.5% tax on remittances sent by non-US citizens, potentially impacting African economies heavily reliant on these financial transfers. Remittances to Africa totaled over $92 billion in 2024, with the US being a major source, and this tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to avoid it. Experts warn this levy could disproportionately affect lower-income groups who depend on remittances for essential expenses like food, education, and medical care. Critics argue the tax is part of a broader campaign against illegal migration, effectively taking money out of people's pockets and reducing vital financial support for families in Africa.</p>

          <p>An inquest is underway in Australia to investigate how Joel Cauchi, a man with a long history of mental illness, was able to carry out a mass stabbing at a busy Sydney shopping center, killing six and injuring 10 others. The inquiry is scrutinizing Cauchi's interactions with police and mental health professionals, including the decision to wean him off antipsychotic medication in 2019. Missed opportunities for intervention and communication breakdowns between different agencies are being examined to determine if the tragedy could have been prevented. The inquest aims to identify potential reforms to prevent similar incidents in the future, focusing on mental health treatment, security protocols, and media reporting.</p>

Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, but the details of the deal are still under review, with Trump needing to approve the final agreement.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, announced that talks with US officials are progressing towards a potential tariff deal as early as June. After meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Akazawa stated that Japan's demand for the removal of all additional US tariffs on Japanese imports remains unchanged. The two countries plan to hold another round of negotiations before the Group of Seven summit in mid-June. Japan is also offering to cooperate in resurrecting the shipbuilding capacity of the United States, and boost cooperation on strategic sectors such as semiconductors and rare earths.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine, Sergeant Major Jody Armentrout, restrained a man who allegedly attempted to open an emergency exit door mid-flight from Tokyo to Houston. Armentrout noticed the man acting suspiciously and intervened when he grabbed the exit door, slamming him to the ground and securing him with zip ties. The flight was diverted to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the man was taken to a local hospital for medical evaluation. A second passenger was also removed from the flight after becoming unruly due to the diversion.</p>

While emphasizing that U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, Trump later admitted that he had not yet seen the final details of the deal, which he previously opposed.</p>
