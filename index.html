The shooting has heightened tensions amidst ongoing conflict in Israel and pro-Palestinian protests in the United States, and local officials have condemned the act as antisemitic and an act of terror.</p>

          <p>Russia's war economy is showing signs of strain under international sanctions and internal pressures, such as inflation and high production costs. Despite attempts to intensify offensive operations in Ukraine, Russia faces depleting military equipment stockpiles and challenges in recruiting soldiers. The central bank's high interest rates aim to curb inflation, but a slowdown in GDP growth suggests potential economic difficulties. Tightened sanctions on Russia's oil exports and declining oil prices are further exacerbating the economic situation, potentially pushing Moscow towards peace negotiations.</p>

The review also recommends managing more offenders in the community and limiting short custodial sentences.

The article argues that claims of systemic discrimination and targeted violence against white South Africans are unfounded, and that white Afrikaners continue to benefit from apartheid's economic legacy. Trump's administration has offered refugee status to Afrikaners, a move criticized as an attempt to flip the narrative of apartheid and spread white replacement conspiracy theories.

          <p>Senate Republicans are attempting to revoke California's vehicle emissions waivers, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could impact numerous states that have adopted California's standards, and the auto industry is divided on the issue.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article details House Republicans' efforts to pass their sweeping domestic policy bill, facing resistance from within their own party. Speaker Mike Johnson and his deputies worked to secure enough votes by negotiating concessions, including speeding up Medicaid work requirements and increasing the state and local tax deduction. Despite pushing the bill past a key committee, it remains uncertain whether Johnson has the necessary support for final passage. The bill is a reflection of competing Republican factions with disparate priorities.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has publicly censured officials following a "serious accident" during the launch ceremony of a new destroyer. The 5,000-ton destroyer lost balance and was damaged, an event Kim described as an intolerable "criminal act." He blamed the accident on carelessness and ordered an investigation, stressing the need for immediate repairs as a matter of state authority. The South Korean military reports that the destroyer remains partially capsized.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega tsunami” could potentially devastate America's West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii if a strong earthquake strikes the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. The earthquake could cause coastal land to sink and trigger waves up to 1,000 feet high, posing a significant risk to cities like Seattle and Portland. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake would strike suddenly, leaving little time for adaptation or mitigation.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled House is set to vote on President Trump's tax and spending bill, which extends the 2017 tax cuts, creates new breaks, ends green-energy subsidies, and boosts spending on the military and immigration enforcement. The bill faces deep divisions within the Republican party, with hardliners pushing for more spending cuts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add trillions to the national debt.

India is working to secure a reduction in tariffs, but Trump's remarks about Apple have complicated the negotiations.
