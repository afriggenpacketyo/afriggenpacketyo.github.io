          <p>In a surprising move, Li Ganjie and Shi Taifeng, Politburo members of China's Communist Party, have swapped roles. Li, now head of the United Front Work Department, will focus on propaganda and outreach. Shi, the new head of the Organisation Department, will oversee official appointments. This unprecedented swap breaks with typical five-year term lengths and lacks historical precedent.</p>
