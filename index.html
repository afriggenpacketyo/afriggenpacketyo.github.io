          <p>United Airlines is partnering with JetBlue Airways in a new venture called Blue Sky, marking United's return to New York's JFK International Airport. This partnership will allow both airlines to sell seats on each other's sites, enabling JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United and vice versa, also including reciprocal loyalty benefits. United CEO Scott Kirby noted that this collaboration will give the airlines the largest presence in Boston and extend United's reach in Florida and the Caribbean, enhancing competitiveness for both carriers. The deal is subject to regulatory review, and financial details were not disclosed. The initial phases of the partnership are expected to commence in the fall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked reciprocal tariffs imposed by President Trump, stating that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports. The ruling, which the Trump administration is appealing, caused Dow futures to jump 500 points and could significantly impact ongoing trade negotiations. The court panel ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, giving the Trump administration 10 days to implement the changes. White House spokesperson Kush Desai criticized the ruling, asserting that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment has created a national emergency.</p>

          <p>A partial glacier collapse in Switzerland triggered a landslide that buried approximately 90% of the village of Blatten, leaving one man missing and prompting a search and rescue operation. Authorities had evacuated around 300 people and livestock from the village earlier this month due to concerns about the glacier's stability. The landslide also blocked the Lonza River, creating a risk of flooding in downstream villages, leading to further evacuations. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about the accelerated retreat of glaciers due to global warming, with Switzerland losing 4% of its total glacier volume in 2023 alone.</p>

          <p>Stock market futures jumped following a federal court's decision to freeze most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump had overstepped his legal authority in assessing a 10% levy, also blocking duties on China, Mexico, and Canada. Overseas markets also experienced gains, with Germany's DAX and Japan's Nikkei 225 index surging following the ruling. Analysts suggest that if the Trump administration loses its appeal, it could reduce downside risks to the economy and upside risks to inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny over the possibility of deporting green card holders, including international students and permanent residents, as part of its immigration crackdown. U.S. law states that green card holders can be deported if they commit actions that make them removable under immigration law, such as committing crimes or jeopardizing public safety or national security. The arrest of anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, has intensified this debate, with Democrats claiming the arrest was an assault on freedom of speech. Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserts that visas are a privilege, not a right, and the administration will continue to revoke visas of individuals disrupting higher education facilities.</p>

Eight oil-producing nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, are set to review market conditions and finalize output steps on May 31. This potential increase aligns with the typical summer increase in crude demand due to higher consumption of jet fuel and gasoline, as well as increased crude burn for electricity production in the Middle East.

Although global markets initially cheered the decision, economists warn that Trump could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs. The ruling has blocked a set of across-the-board tariffs, but existing sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place. The decision has also given the Trump administration 10 days to halt collection of the tariffs, but analysts suggest it may find other ways to impose tariffs.</p>
