          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the World Health Organization have welcomed a peace plan for Gaza proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, with Hamas also issuing positive statements. The proposal aims for a complete ceasefire, the release of all hostages and prisoners, and the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid. Despite these diplomatic efforts, the conflict continues on the ground, with Israeli forces reportedly killing 66 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip over a 24-hour period. The health ministry in Gaza also reported that two children died from starvation during the same timeframe, bringing the total number of such deaths to 459 since the war began.</p>

          <p>Exit polls from the Czech Republic's parliamentary election indicate a strong lead for the right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis. With over 30% of the vote, ANO is significantly ahead of the ruling center-right Spolu coalition, which is polling around 20%. Babis, who has been described as a "Trumpist," has campaigned on a "Czech first" platform and opposes continued military aid to Ukraine. Observers fear his potential victory could shift the country's foreign policy, aligning it more closely with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU positions on Russia and support for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her victory comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after significant election losses under its previous leader, Shigeru Ishiba. Takaichi's leadership will be tested by domestic economic challenges and the need to navigate complex international relations, particularly with the United States and neighboring Asian countries.</p>

In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are clashing over Trump's influence and the federal government shutdown. Virginia's historic race will see either Republican Winsome Earle-Sears or Democrat Abigail Spanberger become the state's first female governor. Other key contests include New York City's mayoral election, a contentious redistricting proposition in California, and crucial state Supreme Court retention elections in Pennsylvania that could shift the court's ideological balance.</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing the first-ever rock samples from the far side of the moon, collected by China's Chang'e-6 mission, have discovered a significant thermal asymmetry between the moon's two hemispheres.

This finding provides crucial new data for understanding the moon's formation and evolutionary processes. The stark differences in topography, crustal structure, and volcanic activity between the two sides have long been a subject of scientific inquiry, previously limited by the lack of physical samples.</p>

          <p>A senior national security prosecutor, Michael Ben’Ary, claims he was abruptly fired from the eastern district of Virginia due to political motivations within the Justice Department. In a farewell note, Ben’Ary stated his termination appeared to be a direct result of a social media post by a pro-Trump commentator who falsely linked him to a senior Biden administration official. He expressed concern that leadership is more focused on punishing perceived political enemies than on national security. Ben’Ary was a key prosecutor in the case against a suspected ISIS member responsible for the 2021 Kabul airport bombing, highlighting the disruption to critical ongoing security cases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated $7.6 billion in grants designated for 223 clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which voted for Kamala Harris in the previous presidential election. The Department of Energy stated the projects were cut after a review determined they were not economically viable or did not advance national energy needs. Critics, however, decry the move as a politically motivated attack on Democratic states and a setback for climate initiatives, job creation, and American energy innovation. The cuts affect a range of projects, including hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, battery plants, and electric grid upgrades.</p>

          <p>The composition and dynamics of the White House press corps have notably changed during President Trump's second term, with the inclusion of reporters and influencers from MAGA-supportive media outlets. These individuals often ask laudatory questions or make fawning comments, which critics argue helps the administration avoid accountability and spread propaganda. The White House now selects the reporter pool for Oval Office press conferences, frequently including fringe outlets while excluding some traditional news agencies. This shift allows the administration to change the tone of press briefings, blunting the momentum of tough questions from mainstream journalists by turning to known allies for softball queries.</p>

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for homeowners, is requesting an average rate increase of 35.8% following an estimated $4 billion in losses from the January fire storms. The proposed hike, which requires approval from the state insurance commissioner, is intended to ensure the plan can cover anticipated claims and expenses as more homeowners rely on it. The request is controversial, as the FAIR Plan faces lawsuits and a state cease-and-desist order over its handling of smoke damage claims. Consumer advocates are urging the commissioner to deny the increase until these claims handling disputes are resolved, arguing it would be another blow to policyholders.</p>

It also notes the general trend of higher benefits for those who delay claiming until age 70 and the subsequent decrease for older retirees due to historical wage differences.

This is the third departure during President Trump's second term, following one resignation and the controversial firing of another commissioner, leaving the agency unable to enforce campaign finance laws effectively.

          <p>English singer Lola Young has initiated legal proceedings against Carter Lang, one of the producers of her viral hit single "Messy," over a dispute regarding songwriting credits. Young's lawyers state that Lang has claimed writing credits on four of her songs, a claim she "strongly refutes," leaving her with no option but to file an intellectual property court claim. The legal action comes just a day after the 24-year-old singer cancelled all upcoming shows due to a collapse on stage in New York. Lang, a prominent producer who has worked with artists like SZA and Justin Bieber, has not yet responded to the lawsuit.</p>

          <h2>Aviation Industry Faces Challenges in Scaling Up Sustainable Fuels for Net-Zero Goal</h2>

          <p>The aviation industry is confronting significant hurdles in its plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal that relies heavily on the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the EU and UK have mandated that 2% of jet fuel be sustainable this year, rising to 10% in Britain by 2030, airline executives are expressing doubt about meeting these targets. Ryanair's CEO dismissed the goals as unachievable, and even SAF proponents like IATA's Willie Walsh admit disappointment in production progress. The high cost, limited supply, and geopolitical factors affecting feedstocks like used cooking oil are creating a bumpy transition toward greener air travel.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an audacious endurance project, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The project, called "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling over 3,000 miles between peaks across six states and then running up each one. This effort is the latest in a series of personal challenges for Jornet, who has shifted his focus from competitive racing to exploring the limits of human endurance and connecting with natural landscapes. His approach emphasized finding "the most aesthetic line" through the mountains, often choosing more difficult and scenic traverses over direct routes to connect the summits.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is seeing a notable surge in support, particularly among ethnic Germans who resettled from the former Soviet Union, often called Russia Germans. A recent study found that 31% of this demographic is prepared to vote for the AfD, a figure significantly higher than the party's average among all voters with migrant backgrounds. This trend was evident in recent municipal elections where the AfD dominated integration councils in cities with large Russia German populations. Researchers attribute this support to the group's conservative views on citizenship and the AfD's Russia-friendly political stance, which resonates with voters maintaining cultural ties to Russia.</p>

          <p>The BBC documentary "Premier Passions" offered an unprecedented, behind-the-scenes look at Sunderland's dramatic 1996-97 season, which ended in relegation from the Premier League. The series became famous for its raw depiction of dressing room dynamics, including manager Peter Reid's expletive-laden team talks, and chronicled the club's transition as it prepared to leave its historic Roker Park ground. At a time when the Premier League's commercial power was exploding, the documentary captured the tension between football's traditions and its modernizing future. Those involved reflect on the production as a historic document that, despite the team's on-field heartache, helped grow the club's profile and fanbase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early sales figures for mooncakes in China are showing a decline compared to previous years, signaling continued weakness in the country's domestic consumer demand. The exchange of these traditional pastries during the Mid-Autumn Festival is often seen as an indicator of consumer and corporate spending enthusiasm. An administrative manager at one Guangzhou firm noted their per-person gift budget for employees was slashed by 40% this year due to a sluggish business environment and recent layoffs. The trend suggests that Chinese consumers and companies are cutting back on non-essential spending amid broader economic uncertainty, impacting even culturally significant traditions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a program offering unaccompanied migrant children in federal custody a one-time payment of $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries. According to a letter from the Department of Homeland Security, the "resettlement support stipend" is available to children aged 14 and older who agree to be deported. The payment is provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. Rights advocates have sharply criticized the policy, calling it a "cruel tactic" that could coerce vulnerable children into making life-altering decisions without fully understanding the risks they may face upon return.</p>
