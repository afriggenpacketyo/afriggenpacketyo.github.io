        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, stating it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson indicated that the increase introduces uncertainty into the global economy and raises costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU had previously paused countermeasures against the U.S. to facilitate negotiations but is now prepared to reinstate them, potentially including expanded measures, if a mutually acceptable resolution is not achieved. Trump's announcement, made at a rally in Pennsylvania, followed earlier indications of his approval of a deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel. The score for this article is 50.</p>
