          <p>Omer Shachar, a co-leader of Run for Their Lives in Boulder, recounts the attack that occurred during a pro-Israel demonstration on Sunday. Shachar felt "panic right away" as his friends caught fire in front of his eyes when a man threw a Molotov cocktail under their legs. The group holds a peaceful walk every Sunday to raise awareness about the hostages who remain held in Gaza by Hamas since Oct. 7, 2023. Participants include those who are "Jewish and non-Jewish, right and left, Israelis and non-Israelis, Americans and non-Americans," he said.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the revocation of guidance to hospitals requiring them to provide emergency abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's medical condition. The previous guidance, issued by the Biden administration in 2022, aimed to preserve abortion access in extreme cases where women faced medical emergencies. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stated that it would continue to enforce the law requiring stabilizing treatment for all patients, but would also rectify perceived legal confusion created by the previous administration's actions. This decision comes amidst ongoing legal battles over abortion laws in various states.</p>

Other vessels under consideration for renaming include those named after Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Harriet Tubman. The potential changes have sparked controversy, with critics accusing the administration of erasing the legacies of those who fought for equality and civil rights.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests a new norovirus strain, GII.17, might have disrupted the predictable seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this stomach bug. The U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December, marking the start of the season for the virus. Last year's season started in October, as GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks, which is why continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype. It is still undetermined if GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered its forecast for UK economic growth this year, citing concerns over US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt. The OECD now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.3% in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 1.4%. The think tank highlighted the UK's "very thin" buffer in public finances and called for measures to boost tax revenue and cut spending. The OECD also cautioned that business sentiment is deteriorating, contributing to the revised forecast. (not investment advice)</p>
