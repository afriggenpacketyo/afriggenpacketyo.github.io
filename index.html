          <p>Bitcoin experienced a price drop, falling below $79,000, mirroring the broader financial market's volatility following President Trump's implementation of restrictive global tariffs. This decline coincided with a significant downturn in U.S. equities, marking their worst performance since 2020. The cryptocurrency market saw substantial long liquidations, with over $181 million in Bitcoin liquidations and $188 million in Ether liquidations within 24 hours, as traders betting on price increases were forced to sell assets to cover losses. The price of bitcoin was last lower by 5% at $78,647.33, according to Coin Metrics, after trading above the $80,000 for most of this year.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge strongly criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man with legal protection from deportation, to a prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis demanded Garcia's return to the U.S., stating his seizure was unlawful and his detention lacked legal basis, directly contravening U.S. law. The Justice Department's lawyer, who argued the case, was put on leave after admitting ignorance of key case details, leading Attorney General Pam Bondi to defend the deportation and claim Garcia's gang affiliation without providing evidence. The judge's opinion underscores the administration's alleged disregard for due process and federal immigration law.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations for car firms as they transition to electric vehicle production ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated the move aims to protect and create jobs amid concerns about President Trump's tariffs on imported cars. The changes include more flexible mandates for phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles, allowing smaller firms to continue producing petrol cars beyond 2030, and permitting some hybrid vehicles until 2035. These measures are intended to support the British car industry despite potential challenges from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their series to the Philadelphia Phillies after a rainy game where starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow struggled with the conditions. Glasnow's command faltered in the third inning due to the rain, leading to walks and runs for the Phillies. Despite Teoscar Hernández driving in five runs and a late rally, the Dodgers couldn't overcome the Phillies, resulting in an 8-7 loss. The defeat marked the Dodgers' first series loss of the season after starting their road trip with a perfect record.</p>

          <p>Foreign ministers from the G7 have denounced China's recent military exercises around Taiwan as provocative and destabilizing, urging peaceful resolution through dialogue. The G7 emphasized that these activities escalate cross-Strait tensions and pose a risk to global security and prosperity. China's military conducted two-day war games near Taiwan, including long-range, live-fire drills in the East China Sea, raising concerns about a potential escalation into a real attack. The G7 statement reflects international concern over China's increasing military assertiveness in the region.</p>

          <p>Despite market turmoil and international pressure, Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have vowed to maintain the course on imposing tariffs. Bessent downplayed concerns about a recession, while Lutnick insisted that the tariffs would remain in place for days and weeks. The administration argues that the tariffs are necessary to address unfair trade practices and create leverage for negotiations with other countries. However, the policy has faced criticism and sparked retaliatory measures from trading partners.</p>

          <p>Apple will continue to host TikTok on its App Store for at least 75 more days following assurances from Attorney General Pam Bondi, after President Trump extended the ban deadline. Bondi's letter stated that Apple would not be penalized for hosting the platform, aligning with Trump's extended deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations. This decision comes amid ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China, including cumulative tariffs of 54% on Chinese goods, with Trump suggesting potential tariff reductions to facilitate a TikTok deal.</p>

          <p>Probationary federal workers are in a state of limbo following mass firings by the Trump administration and subsequent legal challenges. While court orders have led to reinstatements, many workers remain on administrative leave with uncertain futures. The firings, part of a broader effort to downsize the federal government, have sparked concerns about the legality of the terminations and the impact on government services. Legal proceedings are ongoing, and the administration maintains the firings were within its authority, while some workers have found relief through the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old Chinese woman died by suicide while in the custody of U.S. border patrol in Arizona, after being detained for overstaying her visa. Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal stated that initial reports suggest border patrol agents failed to perform required welfare checks prior to the woman’s death. Surveillance footage showed the woman create a noose and tie it around her neck, but no medical response occurred for nearly two hours. Jayapal has expressed concern about conditions at detainment facilities amid an immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>A federal justice department attorney, Erez Reuveni, has been placed on leave after purportedly failing to defend the administration vigorously enough after it says it erroneously deported a Maryland man to El Salvador. Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, announced that Reuveni was no longer actively working on the case or in the justice department in general. The action came after US district judge Paula Xinis had ordered that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who lived in the US legally with a work permit, be returned to Maryland despite the Trump administration’s position that it cannot return him from a sovereign nation.</p>
