          <p>The Trump administration's "reciprocal" tariffs have officially taken effect, imposing higher duties on goods from dozens of U.S. trading partners. Some of the most significant rates include 50% for Brazil and India, and around 40% for nations like Syria, Laos, and Switzerland. In contrast, several key allies negotiated lower rates, with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea facing 15% tariffs and the U.K. at 10%. The move aims to reshape global trade dynamics, which the administration views as historically disadvantageous to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has announced a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and marking its second profitable quarter in a row. The strong performance was primarily fueled by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Fund tech investment arm, which benefited from valuation increases in portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. This positive result comes as the Japanese conglomerate continues its aggressive investment strategy in artificial intelligence, including a major funding round for OpenAI. The company's other holdings, however, reported an investment loss, partially offsetting the group's overall profit. (not investment advice)</p>

The arrests occurred in Bavaria following raids that targeted six suspects across three states, involving approximately 300 investigators. The group is accused of plotting to violently overthrow Germany's constitutional order and participating in weapons training in 2022. This operation is part of an ongoing crackdown on the extremist movement, whose key leaders were arrested in late 2022.</p>

          <p>To address a severe shortage of healthcare providers in Polk County, Florida Polytechnic University and the Orlando College of Osteopathic Medicine are partnering on a new accelerated medical degree program. The initiative will allow a select group of 20 high-achieving students per year to earn both a Bachelor of Science and a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree in six years instead of the traditional eight. By streamlining the curriculum and removing the MCAT requirement for admission, the program aims to produce qualified physicians more quickly and affordably. This effort responds to local data showing the county has significantly fewer doctors per capita than the state average.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor has reduced its full-year operating profit forecast, citing significant financial pressure from U.S. auto tariffs. Although its June-quarter results surpassed estimates, operating profit fell 11% year-on-year, with the company attributing 450 billion yen in losses directly to the American import duties. The world's largest automaker now projects a full-year operating income of 3.2 trillion yen, a downward revision of 600 billion yen. This comes despite strong global sales, highlighting how the tariffs are squeezing margins for Japanese carmakers trying to remain competitive in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

The retrospective explores his five-decade body of work, including iconic films like "Paris, Texas" and "Wings of Desire," as well as his photography and writing. Wenders, a key figure in the New German Cinema movement, is known for his contemplative road movies that explore themes of movement, alienation, and discovery.

Drawing on neuroscience and political theory, the piece posits that human brains are wired for certainty, a trait exploited by authoritarian figures.

          <p>Rushanara Ali, the UK's minister for homelessness, is facing public criticism for substantially increasing the rent on a London property she owns. According to a report, the rent for the East London house was raised by £700 per month shortly after the previous tenants' contract ended. The tenants were reportedly given four months' notice that their lease would not be renewed. A source close to the minister stated that the contract was fixed-term and that the tenants chose to leave after being offered a rolling contract while the house was for sale, with all legal requirements being met.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the significant geopolitical and economic consequences if China and India were to cease buying Russian oil due to U.S. pressure, such as secondary sanctions. Both nations have become crucial buyers for Moscow, with India saving an estimated $33 billion in energy costs since 2022 by purchasing discounted Russian crude. President Trump's recent tariff threats on India are a key part of this pressure. A halt in purchases could trigger a seismic shock in global energy markets, potentially causing oil prices to surge and stoking inflation worldwide, while severely damaging Russia's war-funding revenues.

          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute identifies the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as the most frequently stolen vehicle in the United States. The high-performance muscle car, with a retail price around $75,400, has a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for all vehicles from 2022 to 2024 model years. The analysis notes that thieves often target powerful and expensive vehicles, with pickup trucks also featuring prominently on the most-stolen list. The Camaro's vulnerability is exacerbated by an on-board data port that can be exploited by knowledgeable thieves to steal the car relatively easily.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece offers a sharp critique of "Auschwitz Birkenau," a new coffee-table book by fashion photographer Juergen Teller. The reviewer argues that the project, featuring over 800 bland iPhone photos of the memorial site, contributes nothing to the understanding of the Holocaust. The author finds the work banal and narcissistic, particularly criticizing a photo where Teller singles out his own surname in a book of victims' names. The piece questions the decision to invite a celebrity artist for such a sensitive subject, suggesting it represents a worrying trend of Auschwitz becoming an empty symbol.</p>

          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant technology issue that led to a nationwide ground stop, causing extensive delays at major hubs like Chicago O'Hare, Denver, and Houston. The airline stated the problem was resolved after several hours but warned passengers to expect residual delays as normal operations were restored. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the issue was internal to United and not related to the broader air traffic control system. United is treating the disruption as a preventable delay, meaning it will cover customer expenses like hotels for those affected by the outage.</p>

The blaze, which started on Tuesday, has already burned through 16,000 hectares, making it the largest single fire in the area in nearly 80 years. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by aircraft, are battling the flames, which have resulted in one death, at least one missing person, and 13 injuries. Authorities have evacuated several campsites and villages in the popular tourist region, with officials linking the fire's intensity to global warming and drought conditions.</p>

The tariff would exempt companies that are "building in the United States," benefiting firms like Samsung, SK Hynix, and TSMC, which have made significant U.S. investment pledges and saw their shares rise. Conversely, Japanese semiconductor companies like Tokyo Electron and Renesas Electronics experienced sharp declines on the news. The details of the policy remain unclear, but it appears to favor large companies with the capital to invest in U.S. manufacturing facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study from Harvard Medical School suggests that lithium, a metal commonly used as a mood stabilizer, may play a crucial role in brain health and protecting against Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that lithium is naturally present in the body and required for normal cell function. In experiments, depleting lithium in mice accelerated brain changes associated with Alzheimer's, while maintaining normal levels was protective. The study proposes that beta-amyloid plaques bind to lithium, creating a deficiency that impairs the brain's ability to clear the harmful plaques, offering a potential new pathway for treatment.</p>

This approach aims to incentivize domestic production by penalizing imports, a stark contrast to the subsidy-based CHIPS and Science Act.
