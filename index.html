          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area, marking only the second time in history that the National Weather Service's Chicago office has issued such a warning. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused significantly reduced visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Some areas experienced 'mud rain' due to showers coinciding with the dust storm. A few schools closed due to power outages resulting from previous severe weather events and strong winds are expected to continue into the weekend.</p>

The rivalry between Clark and Reese began during the 2023 NCAA championship game and continued into their rookie WNBA seasons, marked by contentious fouls and intense matchups. Last season, Clark's team won three of the four games against Reese's Sky, which were among the most-watched WNBA games.

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering shutting down two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's announcement earlier in the week that it would close seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal year 2024. The closures are part of a broader plan to streamline operations and address financial challenges within the company.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg reflects on the Democratic Party's response to concerns about Joe Biden's fitness for office, particularly in light of a new book, 'Original Sin,' detailing his decline. She argues that many Democrats were in denial about Biden's condition, driven by groupthink and risk aversion. The article suggests that while Biden's inner circle shielded him, the broader party failed to recognize his weakness, and a reckoning is needed to learn from these missteps. Goldberg also criticizes the party's lack of courage in addressing the issue and the potential for this to divide the party further.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has accused James Comey, former FBI director, of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post featuring seashells arranged as '8647'. Trump supporters interpreted the numbers as a call to assassinate the 47th president, with '86' being slang for 'get rid of'. The Secret Service launched an investigation, and Comey was interviewed, later removing the post and claiming he was unaware of the violent interpretation. The incident underscores ongoing tensions and inflamed political rhetoric, amidst previous assassination attempts and controversial statements from both sides of the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>Moody's downgraded the credit rating of the United States, citing rising debt levels and the failure of successive administrations to address fiscal deficits. This downgrade means all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the U.S. their highest rating. The agency pointed to political gridlock and the potential renewal of tax cuts adopted under Trump as contributing factors. The downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and the government, potentially snowballing into a debt crisis, though past downgrades have had largely symbolic effects.</p>

          <p>A sake brewery in southwestern Japan, Fujii Shuzo, is offering a five-day seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques, which were added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list last year. The seminar, organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to promote sake appreciation beyond Japan. Toru Fujii, the brewery's head, hopes that opening up to overseas participants will increase exports, particularly to Europe, as the domestic sake market declines.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump faced setbacks in the courts and Congress on Friday, including the Supreme Court rejecting a request to block deportations of Venezuelans and right-wing lawmakers derailing his domestic policy bill. The president was on a four-day tour of Gulf states that did not include Israel. Trump voiced his frustration on social media following the court's decision and as his 'big, beautiful bill' faced opposition in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown in Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. The statue, which replaced a wooden version that was set on fire in 2020, was found to be missing this week, with only its hacked-off feet remaining. Residents speculate that it may have been an act of vandalism or melted down for cash. The statue had never quite captured the hearts of the town's residents, with some describing it as unaesthetic.</p>

          <p>With the Democratic Party facing low approval ratings, many top Democrats are trying to distance themselves from past endorsements of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.â€™s acuity. Figures such as Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Ro Khanna are now admitting that Biden suffered cognitive decline while in office and was not fit to run for re-election. As the party strategizes how to rebuild trust, some are suggesting that they must confront how they handled the 2024 race and address the issue of Biden's fitness.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UK/EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key issues for negotiation. The EU is proposing a 'youth mobility scheme' to allow stays of up to four years, but concerns exist about the impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are another potential sticking point, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements while UK fishing groups are calling for changes. The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights expires at the end of June 2026.</p>
