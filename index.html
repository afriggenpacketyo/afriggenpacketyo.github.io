          <p>A major legal claim has been filed in the United Kingdom against Johnson & Johnson by over 3,000 people who allege the company's talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos, causing them to develop cancer and other diseases. The lawsuit, estimated to be worth over £1 billion, accuses J&J of knowing about the contamination for more than fifty years but continuing to market the product. This action follows thousands of similar cases in the U.S., where the company has faced substantial legal and financial repercussions. Kenvue, a company spun off from J&J, has taken responsibility for the litigation and maintains the product's safety.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. cybersecurity company F5 dropped by 10% after it disclosed a significant security breach attributed to a sophisticated nation-state threat actor, reportedly from China. The hackers gained long-term access to the company's BIG-IP product development environment, compromising source code and information on undisclosed vulnerabilities. The breach prompted an emergency directive from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), urging all federal agencies to apply the latest security updates immediately. F5 stated it has not observed any new unauthorized activity since discovering the attack in August.</p>

          <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, fell in a hallway at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday while on his way to a series of votes related to the ongoing government shutdown. The incident occurred as he was approached by two environmental activists, though he did not respond to their questions. Aided by his security detail, McConnell was able to get up and continue walking, later participating in the scheduled votes. This event follows previous health concerns, including a fall in 2023 that led to a prolonged absence from the Senate for rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a new rule imposing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas, which are used to hire skilled foreign workers. The Chamber argues the fee is unlawful and will make it prohibitively expensive for businesses, particularly startups and smaller companies, to access global talent. The H-1B program is crucial for the technology sector, which often relies on skilled workers from countries like India and China. This legal challenge is part of a broader conflict over the administration's efforts to restrict immigration and promote domestic hiring.</p>

          <p>A new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund reveals that Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls per month this year, the highest level recorded in six years. The volume of automated scam texts has also surged, nearly tripling since 2021 as fraudsters adapt to new regulations. These unsolicited communications often aim to trick individuals into revealing personal information or money, with scammers frequently impersonating entities like the IRS or banks. Despite congressional action, less than half of phone companies have fully implemented the required anti-robocall technology, allowing the problem to persist and grow.</p>

The NFL suspended Branch for slapping and pulling off Smith-Schuster's helmet during the scuffle. Despite Franklin's defense, Lions head coach Dan Campbell condemned the behavior as "inexcusable," and Branch himself called his actions "childish."</p>

          <p>An investigation has uncovered that fake versions of a powerful, unlicensed weight-loss drug called Retatrutide are being sold illegally on social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok. Retatrutide, still in clinical trials and not approved for use anywhere, is being marketed by illicit sellers, raising serious safety concerns. A Channel 4 News reporter was easily able to purchase a counterfeit version of the drug from a seller making false claims about its legitimacy. The investigation highlights the dangers of a black market that has emerged due to the high demand for popular weight-loss jabs.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby warned that a prolonged federal government shutdown could negatively affect the airline's bookings. While the carrier has not yet seen a significant impact, Kirby stated that as the shutdown continues, declining consumer confidence in the government's ability to resolve the situation will likely start to deter travel plans. The shutdown has already raised concerns about staffing levels for essential personnel like air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay. This sentiment echoes similar warnings from other airline executives about the economic risks of the ongoing funding impasse.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for 30-year mortgages have fallen again, reaching their lowest point in about a month and creating a more favorable environment for potential homebuyers. Experts advise that buyers should act strategically by getting pre-approved for a loan to strengthen their offers and begin their home search now. However, they also caution against assuming rates will continue to drop, as market conditions can change quickly. The lower rates are expected to attract more competition, meaning the typical seasonal slowdown in the housing market may not occur this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S., which is heavily dependent on China for these critical minerals, has been working to establish a domestic supply chain.

          <p>A new analysis by S&P Global estimates that President Trump's tariffs will impose costs of over $1.2 trillion on global businesses in 2025. The report suggests that companies will absorb only about one-third of this expense, with the remaining two-thirds being passed on to consumers through higher prices. These costs stem from the direct impact of tariffs, which act as taxes on supply chains, as well as from related logistics delays and increased freight expenses. This finding challenges the administration's assertion that foreign exporters will primarily bear the financial burden of the trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
