          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasts predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend. While not expected to impact the United States mainland, its path is projected to pass north of the Caribbean islands, including the Leewards, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Authorities have issued warnings for these areas, anticipating heavy rainfall of up to six inches, which could lead to life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. The storm's development aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season as it approaches its typical peak activity period.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded their summit in Alaska without finalizing a deal to end the war in Ukraine. In a brief statement, Trump mentioned that while many points were agreed upon, significant items remain unresolved, and that the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European nations. He advised Zelenskyy to "make the deal," emphasizing Russia's status as a major power. The meeting, which lasted for hours, ended with little clarity on the specific sticking points or a timeline for future negotiations, leaving the conflict's immediate future uncertain.</p>

          <p>A data breach at a sub-contractor for the UK's Ministry of Defence has potentially exposed the personal information of up to 3,700 Afghans who were resettled in the UK. The compromised data includes names, passport details, and information related to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap). This incident occurred at Inflite The Jet Centre, a service provider at London Stansted airport, and follows a separate major data breach in 2022 that affected nearly 19,000 Afghan applicants. While the government stated there is no evidence the data has been publicly released, the breach raises serious safety concerns for individuals and their families.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has updated its guidance to centralize separation boards for service members who no longer meet military requirements, a change that impacts those affected by new transgender policies. According to an internal memo, once a board determines a member meets the criteria for separation, it is now required to recommend it, removing previous discretion. This move is part of a broader effort by the Defense Secretary to restore a "warrior ethos" and enforce stricter readiness and fitness standards across the armed forces. Supporters argue the change ensures consistency, while critics are concerned about its impact on transgender personnel.</p>

          <p>The recent summit between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without any formal agreements on the Ukraine war, leading analysts to describe it as a meeting that produced no tangible deliverables. Despite Trump's claims of productive talks, the lack of a deal or even a joint press conference suggests a stalemate. For Putin, the summit itself was a significant gain, granting him a high-profile meeting on U.S. soil and reinforcing his international standing after years of being treated as a pariah. The event provided him a platform without requiring any concessions on his core demands regarding Ukraine.</p>

Hardin, convicted of murder and sexual assault, exploited lax security in the prison kitchen to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform. He walked out of a gate after a tower guard unlocked it without confirming his identity, an escape he said required no help from staff or other inmates. After surviving in the woods for nearly two weeks, Hardin was recaptured, and the incident has led to the firing of two prison employees.</p>

This development comes a year after the city enacted laws to permit such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. ADUs, often called granny flats or in-law units, are seen as a key strategy to address the state's housing crisis by providing more affordable starter homes. While ADU construction has boomed, accounting for a fifth of statewide housing growth in 2024, experts are still debating their overall impact on the housing shortage.</p>

The lawsuit claims that the company's Otter Notebook tool often joins meetings and begins recording without notifying all participants, violating federal and state privacy laws. The suit raises concerns that the company's process for "de-identifying" audio data before using it for training may not be sufficient to protect confidential information or guarantee anonymity.

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of California's shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the surrounding Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects have been a primary focus for addressing the region's high rates of asthma and respiratory illness. However, researchers now suggest that the pollution originates from a wide variety of sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. The study's lead author recommends a shift in focus from source control to protecting people where they are most exposed, such as improving indoor air quality in homes and schools.</p>

However, the victory also highlighted Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities, which were exploited by Bournemouth and remain a concern for the team's new season.</p>

          <p>China's bubble tea industry has grown into a multi-billion dollar market, with three major chains raising over $700 million in Hong Kong IPOs this year as investors bet on the country's consumer sector. The industry's rapid expansion is fueled by a franchise-heavy model, which allows for fast growth but poses challenges in maintaining quality control and avoiding market saturation. While brands like Mixue have expanded to tens of thousands of stores globally, they now face intense price wars and rising costs at home. The key test for these companies will be to prove they can build a sustainable business rather than just a passing fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, have unveiled a plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps in a move aimed at gaining up to five House seats. This proposal is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, which are perceived as attempts to rig elections in their favor. The plan would require a constitutional amendment approved by voters in a special election and would significantly alter the political landscape by making several GOP-held districts more favorable to Democrats. The move sets the stage for a high-stakes national political battle over congressional control ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily halted after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator in the Anfield crowd. The referee, Anthony Taylor, stopped play to consult with both managers and captains, and an anti-discrimination message was broadcast at halftime.

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after complaints from the Chinese government, leading the Burmese curator and his wife to flee Thailand and seek asylum in the UK. The show, held at a top Thai gallery, featured works by exiled artists, including those from Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, which the Chinese embassy claimed promoted independence. Following visits from embassy officials, gallery staff covered artists' names and references to these regions with black paint and shut off video installations. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an example of China's transnational repression and an infringement on artistic freedom.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by selling a simple, barebones pickup truck that owners can customize. The company's two-seat Slate Truck is designed to be endlessly customizable with over 100 planned accessories and an "open source" approach that allows third parties to create add-ons. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but has since adjusted its marketing as those incentives are rolled back. The key challenge will be whether the vehicle remains competitive at a higher price point against other budget-friendly models.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to end President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, arguing the move is an unlawful overreach of executive power. The resolution, sponsored by Representative Jamie Raskin and others, invokes the D.C. Home Rule Act, asserting that the president has not met the legal requirement of a "special emergency" to justify the takeover. Lawmakers contend the action undermines local governance and public safety, citing a decrease in the city's crime rate and accusing the administration of creating a crisis for political purposes. The move represents a legislative pushback against the administration's actions.</p>
