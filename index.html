          <p>The Israeli army admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23rd, but alleged some had links to Hamas. Video footage showed the convoy of ambulances and emergency vehicles had lights on, contradicting initial claims. The army stated that soldiers fired upon the convoy after wrongly assuming they were under threat when the ambulances stopped near a car containing Hamas members. Despite admitting the medics were unarmed, the IDF insists at least six were linked to Hamas but has provided no evidence, while the Red Crescent calls for an independent investigation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is relying on tattoos to identify alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TDA) for deportation. However, tattoo artists claim that the designs are being misinterpreted, with some having innocent meanings unrelated to gang affiliation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has used images from online sources and social media, including tattoos honoring births or referencing bands, as examples of TDA tattoos. Artists express concern that their work is being linked to criminal activity.</p>

State officials argue that the federal agency lacks the authority to make such demands and threaten federal education funding. The state maintains that it has already certified compliance with federal civil rights laws and that the administration's stance represents an abrupt shift from previous positions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump dismissed concerns about the stock market's recent decline following the announcement of new tariffs. He compared the market's volatility to an operation and predicted a boom driven by trillions of dollars flowing into the country. Trump's claims come after U.S. stocks experienced their worst one-day sell-off since 2020, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 seeing significant declines.</p>
