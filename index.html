          <p>A fencer's refusal to compete against a transgender opponent at a Maryland meet has escalated into a national debate, reaching Congress. Stephanie Turner, protesting against Red Sullivan, cited fairness concerns in women's sports, leading to disqualification and a viral video. The incident has ignited political pressure, including a congressional hearing and scrutiny from the Trump administration regarding transgender athletes' participation in the 2028 Olympics. U.S.A. Fencing finds itself navigating inclusivity and fair play amid limited research on transgender athletes in fencing, but the organization is willing to change its policy to require that athletes compete according to their biological sex if eligibility rules continue to grow more restrictive.</p>

          <p>AMD reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, with a revenue of $7.44 billion driven by strong demand in its data center segment, which saw a 57% increase due to Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. CEO Lisa Su acknowledged challenges from regulatory restrictions on advanced AI chip exports, particularly impacting shipments to China, but believes these are offset by strong product performance. AMD's chips are being used to train AI models, with a major developer deploying AMD chips for inference. The company's client and gaming segment also rose 28% due to laptop and PC chip sales, while gaming sales declined due to decreased console chip revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ed Martin's nomination to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia is at risk after Republican Senator Thom Tillis announced his opposition, citing Martin's association with "Stop the Steal" and backing of Jan. 6 rioters. With Martin's interim term expiring May 20, his nomination may not make it out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin, who previously defended some Jan. 6 defendants, has expressed views aligning with President Trump's perspective of the Capitol attack as a "day of love," and has fired some of the prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases. Senator Durbin believes that Martin's nomination is unlikely to succeed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's CFPB is pulling back enforcement of a rule classifying Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers as credit card issuers, a move praised by BNPL firms like Affirm who argued the rule created compliance challenges. The CFPB is considering rescinding the rule entirely, prioritizing resources on threats to service members, veterans, and small businesses. This decision follows a lawsuit from the Financial Technology Association challenging the CFPB's imposition of credit card-like restrictions. The rollback comes as data shows increasing financial strain for BNPL users, with nearly half facing related financial problems and rising missed payments.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has launched internal investigations into officers' responses at two San Fernando Valley homes where they investigated reports of violent assaults but did not find the victims because they did not go inside. In both incidents, callers reported hearing or witnessing a violent, active assault to 911 dispatchers, and later a body was found at each location. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell addressed the two incidents during a meeting of the cityâ€™s civilian police commission, the departmentâ€™s oversight board, acknowledging officers did not immediately enter either home and said heâ€™s opened administrative investigations in connection with their responses.</p>
