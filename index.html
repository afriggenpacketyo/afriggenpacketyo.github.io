          <p>Tesla's stock experienced an 8% drop following a public disagreement between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump concerning a congressional spending bill. Trump stated that Musk was displeased about the exclusion of EV credits from the bill, expressing disappointment in Musk's stance, while Musk retorted on social media, criticizing the bill as a "disgusting abomination" and asserting his importance in Trump's election victory. The stock's decline followed a May rally despite weak sales figures, with Musk's term as head of the Department of Government Efficiency ending. This week, the shares are down 12% as Musk has spoken out about the budget bill. (not investment advice)</p>

Justice Elena Kagan stated that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege the kind of participation needed to make out an aiding-and-abetting charge.
