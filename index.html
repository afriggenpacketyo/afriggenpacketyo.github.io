        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines has lowered its profit outlook for 2025 and provided a third-quarter forecast that did not meet analyst expectations, causing its stock to decline. The airline's CEO attributed the revision to weaker consumer spending, stagnant corporate travel demand, and operational issues caused by severe weather. While international travel remains strong, domestic revenue has weakened, prompting the carrier to reduce its planned capacity growth in the coming months. The company's updated guidance for 2025 now ranges from a potential loss to significantly reduced earnings compared to earlier projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Turkish Central Bank Cuts Key Interest Rate by Three Points to 43%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 08:48:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey's central bank has cut its primary interest rate by 300 basis points, lowering it to 43% in a return to monetary easing. This move, which was larger than the 250-point cut anticipated by markets, follows a period of rate hikes aimed at stabilizing the Turkish lira. The bank stated that its tight monetary policy stance is supporting disinflation by moderating domestic demand and improving inflation expectations. While some analysts see the decision as a sign of confidence in tackling inflation, others have expressed disappointment, suggesting the cut was too aggressive and could challenge the bank's credibility.

          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, citing significant uncertainty surrounding global trade negotiations, particularly between the EU and the United States. This decision to pause follows four consecutive rate cuts earlier in the year, which were implemented to combat high inflation. While inflation in the euro area has now reached the bank's 2% target, policymakers remain cautious due to geopolitical volatility. Officials suggest that further rate adjustments will likely wait until September, pending updated economic forecasts and the outcome of the critical EU-U.S. trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

It contrasts the low national average yields with the significantly higher rates available from online banks, which often have lower overhead costs. The piece also explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones, suggesting a laddering strategy for savers.

          <h2>Market Analysts Predict Continued Volatility Amid Tariff Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Despite a market rebound after an initial shock from tariff announcements earlier in the year, investment strategists warn that volatility is likely to persist. The S&P 500 has recovered and reached new highs, suggesting investors are currently comfortable with the prospect of tariffs, believing U.S. firms can manage the impact. However, with blanket tariffs set to be reinstated, uncertainty remains about who will ultimately bear the cost: consumers, U.S. corporations, or international suppliers. Analysts suggest that while strong economic fundamentals could support the market, headlines related to trade policy will continue to create significant market swings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's Industrial Innovation Fund is backing Cambridge Terahertz, a startup that has developed a system to combat fraudulent returns. The startup's 3D imaging technology can see inside unopened packages, allowing retailers to quickly verify if the correct merchandise has been returned, addressing a problem that cost the industry over $100 billion last year. Amazon, which deals with a massive volume of returns, sees the technology as a way to efficiently screen inventory and reduce losses. The investment is part of Amazon's strategy to fund innovative solutions that can be integrated into its vast logistics and operations network.</p>

          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have signed a major free trade agreement, hailed as the most significant deal for Britain since Brexit. The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while making Indian textiles and jewellery cheaper to import into the UK. The deal, which took three years to negotiate, is projected to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually and create over 2,200 jobs. It also includes a new collaborative plan to address illegal migration and enhances cooperation on defense, technology, and security.</p>

          <p>According to new estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), approximately one in eight women in England and Wales were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking in the past year.

This is the first time the ONS has provided a combined prevalence estimate for these offenses, a metric requested by the government to track its goal of halving violence against women and girls.

          <p>A significant escalation of conflict has occurred along the Thailand-Cambodia border, with troops from both nations engaging in clashes involving artillery, rockets, and airstrikes. The fighting, which left at least 11 people dead, mostly civilians, prompted Thailand to seal its border and urge its nationals to leave Cambodia. The violence reportedly began after a landmine explosion injured Thai soldiers, leading to a rapid deterioration of diplomatic relations. Both countries have accused the other of initiating the aggression, with Cambodia requesting an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to address what it calls 'Thailand's aggression.'</p>

One victim, Kaylee Goncalves, had reported seeing an unknown man staring at her outside the house, and on another occasion, the residents found their front door open and loose on its hinges. While it is unclear if these incidents are connected to the killings, the documents illustrate the extensive investigation that led to Kohberger. Police followed numerous leads and ultimately used DNA from a knife sheath, cellphone data, and purchase records to identify and convict him.</p>

On an earnings call, CEO Elon Musk warned that Tesla could face 'a few rough quarters' due to expiring EV tax credits and rising competition in key markets. The company did not provide official guidance for the remainder of the year, a departure from previous statements, signaling uncertainty about a return to sales growth in 2025.

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy and introduce assigned seating for all flights beginning in January 2026. The new procedure will involve passengers boarding in zones and proceeding to pre-selected seats. This change is part of the airline's evolution to offer customers more control and new options, such as purchasing extra legroom seats. When a passenger can select their seat will depend on their fare type and loyalty status. This move follows another major policy shift earlier in the year when the airline ended its free checked bag policy for non-loyalty members.</p>

This article explains that while some materials, including flight logs and redacted contact books, have been released, pressure continues for more transparency, particularly from supporters of President Trump, whose name reportedly appears in unreleased files. The Department of Justice has stated that no 'client list' exists, but conspiracy theories persist. The files remain a point of intense public and political interest due to unanswered questions about Epstein's network and death.</p>

          <p>A senior NHS England doctor has warned that the upcoming five-day strike by resident doctors will inevitably cause harm to patients. Professor Tim Briggs stated that while doctors have the right to strike, the walkouts will disrupt both emergency and non-urgent care, such as hip and knee operations. NHS England's plan to continue non-urgent procedures during the strike has been criticized as unsafe by the British Medical Association (BMA), which argues for cancellations to protect emergency services. The long-running pay dispute has already led to the cancellation of over a million appointments and treatments across the health service.</p>

          <p>The fertility rate in the United States dropped to an all-time low in 2024, with federal data showing a rate of fewer than 1.6 children per woman. This figure is well below the 2.1 rate needed for a generation to replace itself and puts the U.S. on par with many Western European countries. The decline is part of a nearly two-decade trend attributed to women delaying childbirth or choosing not to have children. While the Trump administration has proposed measures to encourage higher birth rates, some population experts are not alarmed, noting that the U.S. population is still growing due to immigration and natural increase.</p>
