          <p>President Trump's new tariffs will initially impact US businesses, potentially leading to price increases for consumers due to increased import costs.  The effect on the UK is uncertain, potentially influenced by exchange rate fluctuations and potential retaliatory tariffs. However, some economists suggest prices could fall as businesses redirect exports to tariff-free markets. The ripple effects could impact jobs in export-oriented sectors like the UK's automotive and pharmaceutical industries. <br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>

          <p>President Trump announced a minimum 10% tariff on all imported goods and higher 'reciprocal' tariffs on specific countries, claiming it will revitalize American industry and end decades of unfair trade practices.  The move is highly controversial, with economists warning of potential economic consequences like inflation and recession.  The tariffs, dubbed "Liberation Day," aim to create a more balanced trade system, but the long-term effects remain uncertain.  The 10% tariff takes effect April 5th, with reciprocal tariffs starting April 9th.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced significant import taxes on goods entering the US, marking a major shift in American trade policy.  Countries deemed "worst offenders," including the EU, China, and several smaller nations, face tariffs as high as 50%.  This move, described as a declaration of economic independence, breaks with decades of free-trade principles and is expected to cause higher prices and slower global growth. The tariffs are set to take effect in early April.</p>

          <p>A federal corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been dismissed with prejudice, meaning he cannot be retried on the same charges.  The Department of Justice cited concerns about the case interfering with Adams' mayoral campaign and ability to cooperate on immigration policy.  The dismissal sparked controversy, with some alleging a quid pro quo between Adams and the Trump administration.

However, the automotive supply chain is particularly vulnerable, with potential job losses and business closures.
