        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk stated on X that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far." This public statement comes after an explosive dispute between Musk and Trump, which had initially disrupted their close alliance and caused market concerns regarding Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict was triggered by Musk's opposition to Trump's tax and spending bill, which Musk criticized for undermining the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increasing the U.S. budget deficit. Despite the initial fallout, Tesla's shares have since recovered from their biggest hit following the row. Optimism surrounding the situation is moderate as Musk attempts to smooth over the rift.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel told CNBC that Commerzbank's current share price is too high for a takeover bid. UniCredit has acquired a 28% stake in Commerzbank since September through derivatives, with ECB authorization to hold up to 29.9%. Orcel stated that a merger bid at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value would not be viable for UniCredit's investors. He also noted UniCredit faces resistance from the German government and is focusing on finding a "constructive solution" before considering a merger, as the share price has exceeded fundamentals. The CEO's comments come as Commerzbank has experienced a surge in share price, but Orcel remains patient.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of disorder with fireworks and bottles thrown at police after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Five people were arrested, and 17 officers were injured, bringing the total to 32. Police used baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse protesters as cars were set on fire and homes were damaged. Community leaders fear someone will be killed and that the violence overshadows sympathies for victims of sexual violence, with tensions rising due to concerns about illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>A Fox News article reports that the U.S. is at risk of losing its force multiplier advantage in space as China advances in the domain, particularly through commercial space companies. Experts warn that proposed budget cuts to commercial satellite imagery by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) threaten both national security and the U.S. commercial space sector. China's Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. (CGST) is rapidly expanding its satellite capabilities, which Western intelligence officials say have been used by Russia for intelligence gathering. The article emphasizes the need for structural reform and sustained investment in American commercial space capabilities to maintain leadership in this critical domain.</p>

          <p>An opinion columnist in the New York Times argues that President Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles to manage protests is a sign of weakness, not strength. The columnist contends that this action highlights the administration's compromised political position and the ineffectiveness of its policies. Strong regimes, the columnist claims, do not typically resort to military force to quell protests. The article suggests that the Trump administration's reliance on blunt force indicates a lack of effective strategies for addressing dissent.</p>

          <p>ABC News terminated its agreement with veteran correspondent Terry Moran following a social media post where he described President Trump and a senior White House official as "world-class haters." The network cited a violation of ABC News policies as the reason for the decision, emphasizing its commitment to objectivity, fairness, and professionalism. The controversy arose after Moran's remarks about Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and President Trump, which were denounced by White House officials.

          <p>NPR reports that an appeal hearing is set for President Trump's criminal conviction and sentencing in his hush money case, marking his latest attempt to overturn the conviction. Trump's lawyers argue the case should be moved to federal court because prosecutors relied on evidence related to his official acts as president. Legal scholars say this particular appeal, based on an antiquated law, is unlikely to succeed, but it is an example of Trump's legal team using every tool at their disposal. The article highlights the complexities of the case and the potential implications of the legal tactics being used.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that states with more permissive gun laws experienced a rise in pediatric firearm deaths between 2011 and 2023, while states with stricter laws did not. Researchers grouped states into three categories based on their gun laws and found that states with the most permissive laws had over 6,000 excess deaths compared to the previous decade. The study suggests that specific gun laws, such as child access prevention laws, could be effective in preventing injuries and deaths. Experts emphasize the need to identify which specific laws can help reduce gun deaths in children and teens.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that the Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 aims to consolidate the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act's federal grant program with 17 other programs and significantly cut funding. This consolidation would give school districts the "flexibility" to spend money without dedicating it to resources for students experiencing homelessness. Advocates worry that schools will prioritize other needs, leading to a lack of support for homeless students. Without dedicated funding, schools may struggle to identify these students, and supports to help them finish high school could disappear.</p>
