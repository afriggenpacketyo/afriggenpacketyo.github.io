          <p>Australian critical metal and rare earths companies experienced a significant stock surge after the US and Australia announced an $8.5 billion minerals deal. This agreement, signed by President Trump and Prime Minister Albanese, aims to boost the supply of key materials for defense and energy, countering China's dominance in the sector. Companies like Lynas Rare Earths and Pilbara Minerals saw substantial gains, with the US planning equity investments in projects like Alcoa's gallium recovery initiative. The deal highlights international efforts to diversify critical mineral supply chains amidst global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>John Stamos has publicly defended his former co-star Lori Loughlin, asserting that her estranged husband, Mossimo Giannulli, was primarily responsible for her entanglement in the 2019 college admissions scandal. Stamos described Giannulli as a "terrible narcissist" who "dragged her through that," claiming Loughlin herself was unaware of the specifics. Loughlin, who served nearly three months in prison, is now separated from Giannulli, five years after the scandal.

          <p>Buckingham Palace is likely to face intensified questions regarding its awareness of Prince Andrew's connections to Jeffrey Epstein, particularly during his time as a working royal. New evidence, including damaging emails showing contact with Epstein after 2010 and documents suggesting Andrew had Virginia Giuffre's social security number, has emerged. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the latter claim with Palace support, while Andrew consistently denies wrongdoing.
