          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, advocating for enhanced artificial intelligence cooperation among member states while firmly rejecting a "Cold War mentality." The summit, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, served as a platform for China to project itself as a global peacemaker amid various international conflicts and trade disputes. Xi pledged significant investments in other SCO countries and support for vocational education programs, emphasizing an opportunity to chart a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation. This diplomatic initiative aims to strengthen regional ties and Beijing's influence, with analysts noting the potential for improved relations with India.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD experienced a nearly 8% decline following a substantial 30% slump in its second-quarter net profit compared to the previous year. This significant drop to 6.36 billion yuan ($891 million) occurred despite a 14% revenue growth, primarily driven by an aggressive price war within China's highly competitive EV market. The company explicitly stated in its mid-year earnings filing that intensified price competition and frequent occurrences of excessive marketing had exerted an adverse periodic impact on the industry's development. Retail car prices in China have fallen significantly, prompting warnings from Chinese authorities against fueling price cuts, underscoring the severe challenges faced by automakers in the region as they expand globally.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.5, surpassing Reuters' economist estimates and marking the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was largely fueled by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience despite ongoing tariffs, although domestic demand gains were more muted. While average raw material costs rose, overall business confidence improved, though employment in the manufacturing sector remained a concern. The article highlights that the upturn resembles a "breath of relief" rather than a sustained rally, dependent on export stabilization and domestic demand pickup, contrasting with a more subdued official PMI.

          <p>UK newspaper headlines feature a range of pressing political discussions, including a report backed by former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw, which suggests that withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights would not jeopardize peace in Northern Ireland, dismissing opposing arguments as "entirely groundless." The Daily Mail focuses on a "sleaze crisis" surrounding Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, with Conservatives alleging internal Labour feuding behind the criticism. Kemi Badenoch's claim of being offered a place at Stanford University at 16 is described as "impossible" by the Guardian, while Reform UK proposes significant council tax cuts through pension fund overhauls. The Daily Express also campaigns for action to halt a "shoplifting crisis," demanding police attendance at every reported theft, highlighting diverse challenges across the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Indian Prime Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, following earlier border conflicts, was significantly influenced by the Trump administration's 50% tariffs on Indian imports for buying Russian oil. India's response reflects a strategy of "strategic autonomy," seeking new opportunities with China while navigating strained US ties. Key takeaways include resumed direct flights and simpler visa processes, though major roadblocks like border disputes and India's burgeoning trade deficit with China remain. This rapprochement presents geopolitical challenges for Delhi, especially concerning its role in anti-China forums like the Quad, with Trump's potential involvement adding further uncertainty to the delicate balance of international relations.</p>

          <p>The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has officially withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before the panel, citing newly revealed health issues. Chairman James Comer had initially subpoenaed Mueller to appear as part of the committee's broad investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, given Mueller's significant tenure as Federal Bureau of Investigation director from 2001 to 2013, a period during which Mr. Epstein was under FBI investigation. Mueller's family subsequently informed The New York Times that he has been battling Parkinson's disease, which directly prohibits him from being able to come before Congress. This decision marks an end to the committee's efforts to compel his testimony regarding the Epstein case.</p>

This incident adds to Suárez's long history of on-field controversies, which include biting opponents and other instances of violent conduct. Major League Soccer has previously issued multi-game suspensions for spitting, indicating potential disciplinary action for Suárez and other players involved in the post-match melee.

Prescott expressed relief that a solution was found to the tension, believing it prevents further "headache and distraction" for the team.

          <p>Private surveys indicate that factory activity across Asia, including export powerhouses like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, contracted in August, largely due to the biting impact of US tariffs. This outcome intensifies concerns for the region's fragile economic recovery, as manufacturers face challenges in growing profits amidst weakening exports in the coming months. However, China's RatingDog General Manufacturing PMI surprisingly rose to 50.5, bucking the regional trend and exceeding market forecasts, although it contradicts a more subdued official survey. Analysts describe a "double-whammy" for Asian economies from higher US tariffs and competition from cheap Chinese exports, underscoring the pressure on policymakers to underpin economic stability and the patchy nature of recovery.

Communications Minister Anika Wells emphasized that social media platforms, as wealthy companies at the forefront of AI, have no excuse not to implement layered age assurance methods.

While the Queen has not previously disclosed this publicly, her extensive public work in recent years has focused on supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, emphasizing courage and destigmatization.

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has left a distinctive mark on the Oval Office, characterized by an extensive "goldening" of its decor, reflecting his background as a real estate developer. Over seven months, gold trimming was added across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, with even sculpted cherubim painted gold. The president personally funded these changes, which also included multiplying the number of presidential paintings and adding gold coasters with his name. While a White House spokesperson described it as a "golden office for the golden age," critics, like musician Jack White, called it "vulgar" and "gaudy," comparing it to a professional wrestler’s dressing room.</p>

          <p>An aid flotilla, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, has set sail from Barcelona bound for Gaza, aiming to "open a humanitarian corridor and end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people." Comprising at least 20 vessels carrying food, water, and medicine, the Global Sumud Flotilla is expected to be joined by more ships from Italy and Tunisia, with an anticipated arrival in mid-September. Thunberg emphasized the humanitarian crisis in Palestine, stating people are being deliberately deprived of basic survival means. This marks her second attempt to reach Gaza, following a previous deportation by Israel, as famine has been officially confirmed in the region, which Israel disputes.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking it as the game's fifth-largest prize, after no one matched all six winning numbers in Saturday's draw. While the top prize remains unclaimed, nine tickets across the U.S. successfully matched all five white balls, with four of these winning tickets sold in California, each yielding $1,165,399. The upcoming Monday drawing offers the potential winner a choice between periodic payments totaling an estimated $1.1 billion or a lump sum estimated at $498.4 million, both calculated before taxes. The jackpot has been steadily growing since May 31, when a single ticket in California claimed a $204.5 million prize, with the odds of winning the current jackpot remaining 1 in 292.2 million.

          <p>UK farmers are issuing warnings about lower yields of essential vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, with some crops already cut by over 50%, due to prolonged drought and record-breaking heatwaves. This summer has been England's warmest June on record, leading to significant depletion of water resources and widespread drought declarations. The British Growers Association expressed "serious concerns" about water supplies if the lack of rain continues, potentially leading to empty shelves. The Met Office attributes increasing frequency and severity of hot spells to human influence and fossil fuel burning, prompting the UK to invest in renewable energy and climate adaptation to achieve net-zero by 2050.</p>

This alleged killing comes as Israel ramps up its military offensive in Gaza City, declaring the populated area a combat zone. The operation has resulted in at least 43 Palestinian fatalities since Saturday, with reports of civilians being killed while seeking aid in perilous corridors. The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification has declared a famine in Gaza City, which Israel disputes, maintaining that supplies are reaching residents.

Pritzker stated that the administration has not communicated with his state regarding such a deployment, which The Washington Post reported could involve thousands of National Guard members. The governor suggested Trump's gambit might be part of a plan to "stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections," likening the playbook to authoritarian regimes.

The State Department previously halted visitor visas for Gaza residents and confirmed denying/revoking visas for PLO and PA members ahead of the UN General Assembly, although it asserts compliance for mission attendance.

However, the scheme faces significant challenges, including long waiting lists for places and nurseries struggling with staff shortages, which limit availability. Some parents are even altering C-section dates to meet eligibility criteria. Research suggests the sector needs 35,000 more staff, and concerns remain about funding rates and additional fees, potentially exacerbating regional inequalities in access to care.</p>
