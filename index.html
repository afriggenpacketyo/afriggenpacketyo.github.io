          <p>Mortgage application volume decreased by 3.9% last week, despite a slight dip in interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinance applications also fell by 4%, although they remain 42% higher than last year, with potential borrowers waiting for more significant rate drops. Applications for home purchases dropped 4% for the week but were 18% higher than the same week last year, driven by increased market supply.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that changes to winter fuel payments will be implemented this year, allowing more people to qualify for the allowance. This decision reverses a previous policy that restricted the payment to those on pension credit, which was criticized for negatively impacting Labour's performance in local elections. While the specifics of the changes remain unclear, the government aims to assist pensioners struggling with energy costs during the winter months. Pensions Minister Torsten Bell clarified that the payment will not return to the previous system of universal distribution to all pensioners.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to reduce dependence on Russian gas and oil, the EU has increased its imports of Russian fertilizer since the start of the war in Ukraine. Russia now accounts for 30% of EU fertilizer imports, raising concerns about the EU's vulnerability to coercive actions by Russia. The European Parliament has endorsed a plan to introduce tariffs on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, gradually increasing them to 50% by 2028. This move aims to diversify the EU's fertilizer sources and promote the use of organic alternatives, though farmers are concerned about the availability of affordable alternatives. </p>

          <p>A Los Angeles court has ordered Lindsey Hill, who accused former MLB pitcher Trevor Bauer of sexual assault, to pay Bauer over $300,000 for violating the terms of their settlement agreement. The ruling comes after Hill discussed Bauer on podcasts and in public appearances, breaching the agreement that prohibited her from stating Bauer paid her any money as consideration for the settlement. Hill has stated she will not comply with the court's decision, while Bauer's agent asserts that Bauer will be able to garnish her wages and seize her assets.

          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa announced that the company's short-term focus is to fix the struggling automaker through major restructuring efforts. Espinosa faces challenges including declining sales, the transition to electric vehicles, and competition from Chinese rivals. The company plans to slash 11,000 jobs and shut down seven plants, expecting a 3% drop in sales volumes. Last year, Nissan considered a tie-up with Honda, but negotiations broke down in February.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has processed approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act, which is leading to higher benefits and lump-sum retroactive payments for nearly 3 million people. The act eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for individuals receiving income from public pensions. The agency expects to update all beneficiary records affected by the law by early November, crediting automation for expediting payments. Commissioner Frank Bisignano has committed to completing the updates promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK trade officials expressed relief after the UK was exempted from the doubling of US tariffs on imported steel. The exemption is contingent on finalizing a deal by July 9; otherwise, the UK's steel tariff rate will increase to 50%. This uncertainty could negatively impact businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The UK government agreed to cut tariffs on some US beef products and ethanol as part of the deal, potentially creating issues for UK ethanol producers and wheat farmers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A congressional watchdog has accused Marjorie Taylor Greene of assembling a "rogues' gallery of extremists" to promote Donald Trump's crackdown on non-government organizations (NGOs). The House subcommittee, chaired by Greene, is holding a hearing to "expose" the use of federal funds by NGOs to advance "radical" agendas. The Congressional Integrity Project (CIP) condemns the hearing as "political theater" and an exercise in hypocrisy, given the federal funding received by Republican allies. The CIP criticizes the witnesses for their extremist views and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) aims to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by setting zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers. The plan is crucial for reducing air pollution and improving public health, but opponents argue it will strain the electric grid and increase costs for consumers. The proposal is not a mandate, but manufacturers will face fees for selling gas-powered units, which will fund an incentive program for zero-emission appliances.</p>

Young is accused of pointing a gun at a fellow agent and brandishing a firearm at another motorist, in addition to causing a hit-and-run accident.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that a sustained signal in the brain, following a positive or negative experience, plays a crucial role in generating emotions. The research, published in Science, identifies two phases of brain activity: an initial, brief sensory response and a subsequent, lingering signal in circuits involved in emotion. The findings could help explain emotional differences seen in neuropsychiatric conditions. Some researchers, however, argue that the sustained signal may not be specific to emotion and could be involved in other cognitive processes.</p>
