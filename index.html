          <p>A psychology expert highlights five phrases introverts use that contribute to their workplace success, emphasizing their thoughtful and precise communication. Introverts often admit what they don't know, seek diverse perspectives, present well-researched input, pause to dig deeper, and clarify underlying concerns. Their reflective minds allow them to listen attentively, understand unspoken tensions, and foster a culture of accuracy and collaboration. This approach leads to more impactful communication and better decision-making, as introverts prioritize substance over theatrics, fostering a more productive work environment.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has been marked by a series of executive orders, including tariffs and the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which have disrupted global trade and sparked concerns about a potential US recession. While Trump promised a "golden age" of prosperity, his policies have created uncertainty among businesses and consumers, particularly due to high tariffs on China-made products. Economists are estimating a significant likelihood of a US recession in 2025, and the S&P 500 remains below its February high. Trump's unpredictable approach is inflicting economic, social, and diplomatic damage, leading to a high disapproval rating.</p>

          <p>General Motors exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but is reassessing its 2025 financial guidance and suspending stock buybacks due to uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's auto tariffs. The company believes the future impacts of tariffs could be significant and is awaiting clarity on the economic and regulatory environments before providing new guidance. GM expects to offset a portion of the North American tariffs and is making adjustments to its production plans. While profit margins were down compared to the previous year, GM described its first-quarter results as strong, citing solid business fundamentals.</p>

The PRCS denounced the findings as an attempt to justify a "war crime". The Israeli military initially claimed its troops fired on "suspicious vehicles" driving in darkness with their headlights and emergency lights off, but later said that account was "mistaken" after video evidence surfaced showing the convoy using its emergency lights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eased a ban on senior American diplomats attending events for the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, reversing a policy that angered Vietnam veterans. The U.S. Consul General attended a reception in Ho Chi Minh City, though the U.S. ambassador was not present. Critics argue that the initial ban demonstrated a lack of understanding about the importance of postwar reconciliation, especially considering Vietnam's current role as a strategic partner in countering China's regional influence. Despite diplomatic tensions, the U.S. and Vietnam have elevated their ties due to shared interests in security and prosperity.</p>

          <p>The Vietnam War, ending 50 years ago, profoundly changed perceptions of war, particularly its long-term psychological and social consequences. It led to the recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the understanding that war's impact extends far beyond the battlefield. The war highlighted the importance of social interaction, remembrance rituals, and reconciliation in overcoming trauma. While Vietnam celebrates the war's end within party-set limits, reconciliation with the former South Vietnamese opponent remains a challenge.

US-led sanctions deter investment in Iran's energy infrastructure, making it expensive to extract and transport gas to Europe.

          <p>Human rights organizations are calling for investigations into the killing of protesters by Kenya's security forces, following a BBC Africa Eye documentary. The documentary revealed how security forces responded to protesters who breached Kenya's parliament in June 2024. Amnesty International and the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) said officers identified in the documentary should "face the law". The BBC said it had cancelled a private screening of the documentary in Kenya's capital Nairobi "due to pressure from the authorities".</p>

          <p>Dramatic cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under the Trump administration could significantly alter the agency's ability to protect consumers. With staff potentially reduced to 200, the CFPB may become a vastly different entity, leading to uncertainty about its work for consumers and companies. Efforts to cap bank overdraft fees and regulate payment apps have been overturned or left in doubt. The effectiveness of the consumer complaint database is also at risk. Experts anticipate a decline in consumer protection and enforcement capabilities. </p>
