          <p>Sam Rivers, the bassist for the nu-metal band Limp Bizkit, has passed away at the age of 48, as announced by the band on social media. The circumstances of his death were not disclosed, but his bandmates paid tribute to him as the "soul in the sound" and a "once-in-a-lifetime kind of human." Rivers had previously taken a hiatus from the band in 2015 due to severe liver disease, which led to a transplant before he rejoined the group in 2018. His passing comes as the band was preparing for an upcoming tour in Central and South America.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team has advanced to the World Cup semi-finals after a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India. England set a target of 289, anchored by a century from former captain Heather Knight. India appeared to be on track for a win, reaching 234-3, but the dismissal of opener Smriti Mandhana for 88 triggered a middle-order collapse under pressure. Despite a half-century from Deepti Sharma, India fell just short in the final over, leaving them needing to win their remaining games to secure their own semi-final position after three consecutive losses.</p>

The insights suggest that Salesforce's AI platform is performing well, defying skepticism, and that the AI hardware market is large enough for companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to thrive simultaneously. The article also conveyed growing concerns among OpenAI's backers about its consumer-focused strategy and spending. Other takeaways included recommendations to sell speculative nuclear and quantum computing stocks, while expressing optimism for Dell's market position and Levi Strauss's product line.

          <h2>Authors Propose Diet Based on Biblical Foods for Modern Wellness</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book titled "The Biblio Diet" suggests that a dietary plan based on foods mentioned in the Bible can improve physical health and potentially reverse serious illnesses. The authors, Dr. Josh Axe and Jordan Rubin, advocate for consuming foods like red meat, whole-grain sourdough, olive oil, and raw honey, while avoiding items labeled as "unclean" in Leviticus, such as pork and shellfish. They also emphasize the importance of avoiding modern processed ingredients. Beyond diet, the book promotes other biblical practices like fasting and prayer, framing overall health as a way to honor God and a path to holistic well-being.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 35-7 at Wembley Stadium in London, improving their record to 5-2 before their bye week. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns, three of which were to receiver Davante Adams, effectively compensating for the absence of injured star Puka Nacua. The Rams' defense was dominant, recording seven sacks on Jaguars' quarterback Trevor Lawrence, with rookie edge rushers Jared Verse and Byron Young leading the charge. The victory continues coach Sean McVay's undefeated streak in London games and positions the team strongly for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown enters its 19th day, Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona stated that the stalemate could be resolved this week if Republicans would negotiate on extending health insurance tax credits. Democrats have consistently blocked funding measures, demanding a resolution to the expiring subsidies which are expected to cause premium hikes on November 1st. Conversely, Republican Senator Katie Britt of Alabama urged Democrats to reopen the government first before any discussions on healthcare. With no meetings between congressional leaders since the shutdown began, both parties remain entrenched in their positions, leaving federal operations partially suspended.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde described the global economy as being in a state of "transformation," driven by trade tariffs and artificial intelligence. In an interview, she warned that the full economic pain from U.S. tariffs has not yet been felt by consumers, as companies are currently absorbing the costs by squeezing their profit margins. Lagarde also noted that escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China are typical negotiating tactics but will require resolution.

          <p>President Trump announced an immediate halt to U.S. aid and subsidies to Colombia, labeling the nation's president, Gustavo Petro, an "illegal drug leader." The decision follows President Petro's sharp criticism of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, which he claimed killed a Colombian fisherman and violated his country's sovereignty. Trump accused Petro of allowing massive drug production and threatened further action if the situation is not addressed. This move marks a significant escalation in tensions between the two traditional allies, stemming from the administration's aggressive anti-narcotics military operations in the region.</p>

          <p>Tobacco use in Southeast Asia has significantly decreased over the past two decades, with smoking prevalence dropping from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, according to a WHO report.

However, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth, and challenges remain, particularly in Indonesia, which has high smoking rates and significant tobacco industry influence.

The Education Department had previously paused forgiveness under the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans. The agreement ensures that eligible borrowers in these programs will again have their debt cancelled after making qualifying payments for 20 to 25 years.</p>

Manager Brendan Rodgers lamented the lack of "firepower" in his squad following recent player sales, comparing his team's potential to driving a Honda Civic like a Ferrari.

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. Acknowledging the country's severe cost-of-living crisis, Miliband stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues" to provide relief, though he emphasized that the long-term solution is transitioning to home-grown clean energy. Scrapping the tax could save an average household around £86 per year. The potential move comes as the government faces mounting pressure to lower energy costs, which recently increased by 2% for millions of households under the latest regulatory price cap.</p>

Critics argue the tax could deter investment and encourage capital flight.

One item, reportedly the crown of Empress Eugénie, was found dropped and broken near the scene, but the full extent of the loss is still being assessed.</p>

          <p>J.D. Power has released its 2025 North American Airport Satisfaction Study, which evaluates mega-airports based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, and staff. The study, which defines mega-airports as those serving 33 million or more passengers annually, found that overall satisfaction remains high despite record travel numbers. An expert noted that the top-performing airports excel in fundamental areas such as cleanliness and TSA efficiency, with food, beverage, and retail options being a significant factor in scores. While the ongoing government shutdown is causing some travel disruptions, it has not yet had a major impact on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched aircraft and artillery strikes on targets in southern Gaza, stating the action was a response to attacks on its soldiers by Hamas. An Israeli official reported that Hamas fighters used a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire, calling it a significant violation of the recently brokered ceasefire. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take "strong action." Hamas, however, denied any involvement in the reported clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and stating it had lost contact with its remaining groups in that specific area.</p>

          <p>A shooting that occurred after a high school football game in Leland, Mississippi, has claimed its seventh victim after a 25-year-old woman succumbed to her injuries. The incident, which took place on October 11 during homecoming weekend celebrations, also wounded more than a dozen other people. The FBI has suggested the violence may have been triggered by a disagreement between several individuals. Authorities have arrested at least nine people in connection with the shooting, with several facing capital murder charges, as the small Mississippi Delta town continues to mourn the significant loss of life.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip. Such an act would be a grave violation of the recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement. Hamas has rejected the claim as "false allegations" and accused Israel of supporting armed gangs in the territory. The warning comes after a video surfaced showing Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. The situation highlights the fragile nature of the ceasefire and the complex power dynamics within Gaza as post-war governance plans are debated.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis highlights the concept of "asymmetric upside" in the stock market, demonstrating that historical gains during bull markets have far surpassed the losses from preceding bear markets. For example, while a 50% loss requires a 100% gain to break even, the S&P 500 has consistently recovered and achieved significant new highs. After the 2007 financial crisis caused a 55% decline, the market responded with an 11-year bull run that delivered a 527% return. This historical data suggests that for long-term investors in diversified indexes, the potential for substantial gains has historically outweighed the impact of periodic downturns.

          <p>Thousands of spectators gathered in Madrid to watch the annual Transhumance Festival, where a large flock of sheep and goats were herded through the city's streets. The event honors the ancient pastoral tradition of moving livestock between seasonal grazing grounds and highlights its modern environmental benefits, such as using livestock to clear flammable undergrowth and reduce wildfire risk. The festival, which has been held since 1994, follows an ancient migration route that the Spanish capital was built upon. As part of the tradition, organizers pay a symbolic fee of medieval coins to city hall for the animals' right of passage.</p>

          <p>Following more than a week of deadly border clashes, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after the most intense fighting between the two sides since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The conflict had escalated after Pakistan was accused of carrying out attacks in Kabul. Under the new deal, the Taliban has agreed not to support groups that attack Pakistan, and both parties have committed to avoiding targeting security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner, a key architect of the Israel-Hamas peace deal, stated that the long-term success of the agreement depends on creating a "viable alternative" for governing Gaza. In a "60 Minutes" interview, he predicted that Hamas would use violence to try and reassert control, a concern echoed by a recent U.S. warning of a potential Hamas attack on Palestinian civilians. Kushner argued that if the international community and qualified Palestinians can establish effective governance, Hamas will ultimately fail, and Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel. The peace plan's first phase has seen hostage and prisoner exchanges, but the future governing structure remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance attended a celebration for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, which featured a large-scale live artillery demonstration. The exercise prompted criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who cited safety risks and closed a portion of a major interstate highway due to the unexpected explosions. During his speech, Vance, a Marine veteran, praised the military, criticized what he called "woke" diversity initiatives, and blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown. His office dismissed Newsom's safety concerns as attempts to stoke fear and oppose essential military training.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a strategy to create an additional 400,000 jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030 to support its transition to renewable power. The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, and includes initiatives like establishing new technical colleges and programs to match military veterans with careers in solar, wind, and nuclear industries. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the plan will bring well-paid, secure jobs to industrial heartlands and is essential for lowering energy bills long-term. The announcement was welcomed by unions, though the opposition criticized the government's current net-zero policies for driving up electricity costs.</p>
