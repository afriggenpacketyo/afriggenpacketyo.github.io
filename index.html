          <p>A 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has successfully completed an eight-and-a-half-year challenge to cycle down all 282 of the country's Munro mountains. Sean Green is believed to be only the second person to achieve this feat, which involved carrying his bike to each 3,000-foot summit before riding down. The semi-professional cyclist described the logistical challenges and the significant time commitment, often involving 12 to 16-hour days including travel, as the most difficult aspects of his quest. The article provides context on "Munro bagging," a popular mountaineering challenge inspired by Sir Hugh Munro.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a Florida golf course, is returning to court to renew his request to dismiss his public defenders and represent himself. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a September trial, and the judge has indicated the date will not be delayed. His court-appointed lawyers have filed a motion to be removed, citing an "irreconcilably broken" attorney-client relationship and Routh's refusal to meet with them. The case involves charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Mexican Immigrants Detained in Los Angeles Raids Have Deep Roots in the U.S.</h2>

          <p>A study by the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles reveals that many Mexican citizens recently detained in U.S. immigration raids have long-established lives in the country. Based on interviews with 330 detainees, the report found that over half had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade, with more than a third residing there for over 20 years. Nearly one-third of those interviewed have U.S.-born children, challenging the notion that recent detainees are new arrivals. The findings highlight the human cost of immigration enforcement, affecting individuals deeply integrated into American society and the Southern California economy.</p>

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport is reportedly planning to build a dedicated "repatriation terminal" by 2028 to process deportations of migrants with rejected asylum claims or criminal convictions. The facility is designed to handle up to 100 individuals daily and has drawn mixed political reactions, with some officials supporting it as a sensible measure while others are critical. Separately, the article notes that Germany's Central Committee of German Catholics has expressed dismay over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The group called on the German government to ensure Israel respects international law, citing the catastrophic conditions and starvation risk for civilians.</p>

          <p>Court records from a New Orleans lawsuit show that the late Pedro Arrupe, a former worldwide leader of the Jesuits and a candidate for Catholic sainthood, was aware of multiple sexual molestation accusations against an aspiring priest, Donald J. Dickerson. Despite being warned in a 1977 letter that Dickerson was a "poor risk for ordination," Arrupe did not appear to prevent his eventual ordination in 1980. Dickerson was later accused of sexually assaulting other minors, including a 17-year-old student at Loyola University New Orleans. The revelations raise serious questions about Arrupe's legacy and the church's handling of abuse cases.</p>

The administration argues that such models can lead to discriminatory outcomes and distort information, citing a past example of an AI tool altering the race of historical figures.

The number of UK students reporting mental health conditions has nearly quadrupled in a decade, yet services are often described as "one-size-fits-all" and difficult to navigate. While universities have increased investment, they stress they are not a replacement for NHS clinical services, and academics acting as personal tutors often feel untrained for crisis intervention.

Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for Maxwell to provide a deposition on August 11, adding to the legal and political scrutiny surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, states like Utah are increasingly passing laws to compel local governments to allow for more dense and affordable housing. With Utah's median home price soaring out of reach for most renters, the state has mandated that cities and counties adopt strategies to create cheaper housing options. This top-down approach has met resistance from some local leaders who are concerned about losing control over planning and the strain on infrastructure. The article highlights the tension between the urgent need for affordable homes and the "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) sentiment prevalent in many communities.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have relaunched their joint maritime research missions for the first time since before the pandemic, signaling deepening scientific cooperation. A team of 25 researchers has set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day expedition to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific. The mission, the ninth of its kind between the two nations, will focus on understanding ocean evolution and climate feedback systems over the past 126,000 years. The resumption of these surveys underscores a shared commitment to marine science and may reflect broader geopolitical alignments, including ambitions in the Arctic.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the league's stars defeat a team from Mexico's Liga MX 3-1, provided entertainment but also highlighted a growing debate about its relevance. The absence of the league's biggest star, Lionel Messi, who could face a suspension for skipping the event, has intensified questions about the game's format and purpose. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to re-evaluate the event to keep it competitive and engaging for players and fans, especially as the league seeks to grow its viewership. The article suggests that while the event is a fixture of American sports culture, it may need to evolve to remain meaningful.</p>

The university will pay $200 million to the government and an additional $21 million to the EEOC, while the administration will restore hundreds of millions in federal research grants that had been withheld. As part of the deal, Columbia will implement reforms such as banning identity-concealing masks at protests and hiring special safety officers. The agreement has drawn mixed reactions, with some praising it as a roadmap for university accountability and others criticizing Columbia for capitulating.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of major health issues like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. This more attainable target challenges the widely promoted but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found substantial health benefits starting from around 4,000 steps, with many benefits leveling off after 7,000. The findings may encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical way to improve their physical and mental well-being.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has described the physical and psychological abuse he endured after the Trump administration sent him and over 250 other Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Despite having no criminal record, Suarez was accused of being a gang member and spent four months in the CECOT prison, a facility for terrorists, where he says they were constantly beaten and humiliated. Suarez, who was recently released in a prisoner swap, believes he was targeted simply for being Venezuelan and having tattoos.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This policy upends a long-standing practice, established by a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which required all unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries to be transferred to government-run shelters. Under the new directive, teens who do not choose to self-deport will still be sent to shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration cites new authorities in a recent spending law for the change, which was previously only applied to minors from Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency (EA) in England has cancelled thousands of water tests intended to detect harmful pollution in rivers and lakes over the last three months due to significant staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that seven national inorganic testing programs have been paused, affecting monitoring for substances like nitrates and phosphates from sewage or agricultural runoff. The regulator confirmed its main laboratory is operating at 15% below capacity, leading to 10,000 cancelled tests between May and July. The cutbacks raise serious concerns about the EA's ability to effectively monitor and manage England's water systems, which are already facing a pollution crisis.</p>

An oceanography student from Scripps Institution of Oceanography found the creature, which is known for its vibrant purple shell and bubble raft that keeps it afloat in the open ocean. These snails usually inhabit warmer subtropical seas, and their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore water moving toward the coast. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers will be monitoring for more sightings if warm water trends continue, highlighting potential shifts in marine ecosystems.</p>

This development comes as a Florida judge denied the DOJ's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein's 2006 case, citing secrecy rules.
