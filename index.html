          <p>A new report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) reveals that the gap between what Americans earn and what they need for a basic standard of living is widening. The analysis considers costs beyond necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare. The report finds that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households, who would need to earn $67,000 annually, compared to their average of $38,000. The cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for lower-income earners have fallen.</p>

          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy defended President Trump's possible acceptance of a Qatari-offered jet for presidential use, shifting blame to Boeing for delays in providing a new Air Force One. McCarthy argued that Trump, as a businessman, seeks deals that avoid taxpayer expense, while emphasizing the need for a new presidential aircraft due to the age of the current planes. He suggested Boeing should lease a temporary plane, even the Qatari jet, to address the delay and remove implications of a gift. Several Republicans have expressed concern about the offer.</p>

          <p>A new social media trend known as the ‚ÄúChromebook challenge‚Äù is causing disruptions in schools across the country, as students deliberately short-circuit their school-issued laptops and share the footage online. The challenge involves inserting objects into the laptops' ports to cause sparks and smoke, leading to damaged computers, scorched floors, evacuations, and even criminal charges for some students. School districts are sending letters to families, suspending students, and imposing fines for property damage. TikTok has begun removing content related to the challenge and redirecting search terms to safety messages.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Virginia has ordered the immediate release of Georgetown academic Badar Khan Suri from ICE detention, stating it was in the public interest to disrupt the chilling effect on protected speech. Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, was detained for two months, with immigration officials revoking his student visa based on his father-in-law's past association with Hamas and his social media posts supporting Palestine. The judge found that the government did not submit sufficient evidence to support its claims.

It also seeks to eliminate the 1099-K reporting rule and taxes on tips and overtime pay.

Routh's lawyers claim that his prior felony convictions should not preclude him from owning a firearm and that the absence of a serial number does not remove a firearm from Second Amendment protection. Prosecutors maintain that the statute prohibiting felons from possessing firearms is still law and that a firearm with an obliterated serial number has no lawful purpose.

Critics worry that foreign actors may purchase influence with Trump through these ventures and that his administration's push for deregulation could benefit his personal financial interests. The $TRUMP coin has attracted foreign-tied investors, and the Trump family's crypto empire has expanded to include other cryptocurrencies and ventures.

          <h2>'Pfizergate' Ruling Deals Blow to European Commission's Transparency</h2>

          <p>The EU's General Court annulled a European Commission decision denying a journalist access to text messages between Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, raising doubts about the Commission's commitment to transparency. The case involves messages reportedly exchanged during the EU's negotiation of a COVID-19 vaccine contract with Pfizer. The court concluded that the Commission failed to justify its claim that it did not possess the requested documents. The ruling has sparked criticism from members of the European Parliament and transparency watchdogs, who call for greater accountability and oversight.</p>

          <p>Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who designed America's hydrogen bomb and advised a dozen presidents on defense policies, has died at 97. At age 23, Garwin designed the first fusion bomb and later contributed to advancements in computers, communications, and medicine. He also advocated for nuclear arms control and clashed with the military over various weapons systems. Despite his role in creating the hydrogen bomb, Garwin maintained that it was only useful for deterrence.</p>

          <p>The Justice Secretary of England and Wales announced limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison, aiming to alleviate overcrowding. Offenders recalled for breaching licenses will be released after a fixed 28-day period, freeing up approximately 1,400 prison spaces. While a ¬£4.7bn investment will fund more prisons, it won't solve the crisis, and the government faces running out of space for male offenders by November. The changes will not apply to serious criminals or those deemed high-risk.</p>

Critics argue the move would reduce the O.D.N.I.'s oversight and create inefficiencies, while Gabbard's office claims it will speed response times and provide more timely intelligence.

          <p>House Republicans have advanced trillions of tax breaks as part of President Donald Trump's economic package. The House Ways and Means Committee passed its portion of the legislation, but the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains in limbo. While the bill would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, some lawmakers want a higher limit before the full House vote. The full House vote may come as early as next week, but the legislation could see significant changes in the Senate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's challenge to birthright citizenship, a long-held legal principle established by the 14th Amendment, has reached the Supreme Court. Trump has argued that the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States, is "about slavery" and does not apply to tourists or undocumented immigrants. This theory, once considered unorthodox, has gained traction due to Trump's promotion of it. The Supreme Court will consider whether federal judges have the power to order temporary pauses on Trump's policy, with the question of birthright citizenship forming the backdrop.</p>
