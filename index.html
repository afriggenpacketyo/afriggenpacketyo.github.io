        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of American Jewish organizations, including some that traditionally offer staunch support for Israel, are publicly urging the country to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza amid a worsening famine. Groups like the American Jewish Committee and the Reform movement have issued statements expressing deep concern for Palestinian civilians and calling for action to alleviate suffering, even while condemning Hamas. This reflects a significant shift in public discourse within the American Jewish community, as discomfort with Israel's wartime policies broadens beyond traditionally left-leaning groups.</p>

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted to unionize, joining a growing movement of cafe organizing across the United States. The workers, who will be represented by the Blue Bottle Independent Union, are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, as well as improved benefits. They also cite the loss of perks since Nestlé acquired the company and a desire for more transparency in the company's coffee sourcing practices.</p>

          <p>Businesses in Southern California's 'Little India' are bracing for the impact of a new 25% tariff on goods imported from India. Owners of grocery stores, jewelers, and apparel shops express anxiety, stating they will have no choice but to pass the increased costs on to consumers. Many fear this will lead to a significant drop in sales, compounding a recent slowdown they attribute to economic uncertainty and fear within the immigrant community. The tariffs are part of a broader trade policy shift, leaving small business owners feeling like victims in a larger geopolitical game. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Syrians are preparing for parliamentary elections in September, the first since the collapse of the Assad regime, which will establish a transitional parliament for three years. While the event is seen as a historic moment of hope, it faces numerous challenges, including a general loss of trust among ethnic and religious minorities. Experts note that interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa's significant influence over the appointment of 70 of the 210 seats is controversial.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's second term suggests that world leaders are increasingly using praise and flattery as a primary diplomatic strategy. From the UK Prime Minister presenting a rare state visit invitation to the Israeli Prime Minister nominating him for a Nobel Peace Prize, leaders appear to have learned that appealing to Trump's desire to be seen as a uniquely successful figure is effective. Experts say this marks a shift from his first term, as foreign governments now recognize that dealing directly with the president, and stroking his ego, is the most direct path to achieving their goals.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released a jobs report that was weaker than expected. The report showed slower job growth and revised previous months' figures down, which Trump claimed, without evidence, was 'RIGGED.' The move, which was followed by a drop in stock markets, has drawn sharp criticism for politicizing a vital government data agency. Critics, including former officials, warned that such actions are characteristic of authoritarian countries and destroy public trust in official statistics. (not investment advice)</p>

His departure comes after leading Spurs to their first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League in May.

          <p>A manhunt is ongoing in Tennessee for Austin Robert Drummond, a 28-year-old man suspected of killing four relatives. The victims were identified as the parents, grandmother, and uncle of a seven-month-old baby who was found abandoned but safe in a front yard. Police believe Drummond, who they consider armed and dangerous, dropped off the infant after the killings in what an official described as an act of 'compassion.' The suspect, who was out on bond for other charges including attempted murder, had a prior relationship with the family.</p>

Badenoch revealed she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and considers the UK her home. The statement comes after she previously faced criticism from Nigeria's vice-president for comments perceived as denigrating the country.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing a surprising link to an ancestor of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers found that about nine million years ago, a tomato-like plant hybridized with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient event was a key driver in the development of the potato's tuber, the edible part that has made it a global food staple. The research, published in the journal Cell, provides new insight into the hybrid ancestry of this crucial crop.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's order temporarily blocking federal agents from conducting indiscriminate immigration patrols in Southern California. The ruling affirms that agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or presence in a particular location without establishing reasonable suspicion of illegal status. The court rejected the government's claim that the injunction harmed its enforcement efforts, stating there is no harm in being told not to do something that is already unconstitutional. Civil rights groups and local officials celebrated the decision as a victory for constitutional rights.</p>
