          <p>The UK is bracing for a mini-heatwave, expected to positively impact nature as migratory birds arrive and butterflies emerge, according to the British Trust for Ornithology. While a short warm spell won't drastically alter the natural world, it provides an opportunity for nature enthusiasts to enjoy the spring season. Wildlife charities urge caution to prevent wildfires due to dry conditions, as climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of such fires, posing a threat to vulnerable wildlife, particularly in heathland areas. The Met Office suggests that temporary warmth could benefit wildlife, but the long-term impacts of climate change remain a significant concern.</p>

          <p>A third round of talks between Iran and the United States is planned, aiming to achieve a new accord on Tehran's nuclear activities and prevent further conflict in the Middle East. President Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal with Iran, highlighting the potential to reshape regional and global security. A successful agreement could reduce the risk of a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, while also easing sanctions and opening Iran to foreign investment.</p>
