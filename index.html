          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil trade route. Rubio emphasized China's heavy reliance on the strait for its oil imports, as China is Iran's primary oil customer. Iran's foreign minister had earlier stated that the country reserves the right to defend its sovereignty after U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts warn that closure of the strait could cause oil prices to surge and significantly impact the global economy, though the U.S. Navy is expected to respond swiftly to any attempt to block the waterway.

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, analysts are examining potential escalation pathways that could lead to a larger conflict. One scenario involves the U.S. needing to conduct further bombing to fully disable Iran's nuclear capabilities, while another involves Iran retaliating against U.S. forces or international shipping lanes. The article draws parallels to the 2003 Iraq War, cautioning that the Trump administration may not fully grasp the potential consequences of its actions. The author expresses concern over the administration's competency in handling the complex situation and preparing for potential responses.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated the US carried out a successful bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, and the Pentagon indicated it will take time to fully assess the effect of the attack. Israel says they were in full coordination with the US in planning the strikes, while Iranian officials have confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow. The US used 125 military aircraft, including seven B-2 stealth bombers, and a total of 14 MOPs were dropped on two target areas. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization said the bombing of the three nuclear sites was a "barbaric violation" of international law.</p>

          <h2>Strait of Hormuz Security in Focus Amid Conflict</h2>

          <p>The conflict between the U.S. and Iran has brought renewed attention to the security of the Strait of Hormuz. Iran is reportedly considering blocking the waterway following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. The Strait of Hormuz is considered the world's most important oil transit chokepoint, with around 20 million barrels of crude, condensate, and fuels flowing through it daily. Experts suggest that Iran is unlikely to close the strait and that exporters have alternative options if it does.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the Pentagon briefing emphasized the success of the operation but provided limited details on future actions. The U.S. wants Iran to negotiate peace and has threatened further aggression if it does not. The Americans want this attack to have been a "one-and-done." Iran is wounded, but its ability to strike back is limited for now.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is "at war with Iran's nuclear program" rather than with Iran itself, as the White House hopes to maintain this position. He believes the U.S. has substantially delayed Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon, despite claims that Iranian nuclear sites were not completely destroyed. Analysts are divided on whether the strikes will bring Iran to the negotiating table or encourage them to pursue weapons-grade uranium enrichment more aggressively.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites and urged Iran to pursue diplomacy.

Rubio emphasized that the U.S. will defend Americans, including soldiers on military bases, from Iran and its proxies.</p>

          <p>A suicide bombing at a church on the outskirts of Damascus has killed at least 20 people and wounded 52 others.

The Syrian Civil Defence posted photos and video from inside the church showing a heavily damaged altar, pews covered in broken glass and a bloodied floor.</p>

          <p>The practice of immigration agents wearing masks to avoid recognition is being criticized as undermining authority and endangering public safety. Critics argue that masking contradicts Department of Homeland Security guidelines and can provide cover for agents to violate constitutional rights. The lack of uniformity in the masks worn by agents can cause confusion and increase the risk of interference in law enforcement actions. The author suggests that Congress should prohibit the use of masks by immigration agents, arguing that accountability should take precedence over agent anonymity.</p>
