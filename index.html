          <p>Democratic nominee for Virginia Attorney General, Jay Jones, is facing widespread bipartisan condemnation after 2022 text messages resurfaced. In the messages, Jones made inflammatory remarks, including hypothetically shooting a Republican political opponent, former House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones has since issued a public apology, expressing shame and embarrassment for his words. The controversy has drawn criticism from both Democratic and Republican leaders in the state and at the national level, with some calling for him to withdraw from the race.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has identified the release of all hostages from Gaza as the most critical and immediate component of the peace plan proposed by President Trump. As negotiators prepare for talks in Cairo, Rubio emphasized that the logistical details for the exchange must be finalized quickly and that active fighting must cease to facilitate a safe release. The plan involves Hamas freeing all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with subsequent phases addressing the long-term governance and security of a post-Hamas Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown enters its fifth day, the Trump administration has indicated that federal employee layoffs may begin if negotiations with Democrats remain stalled. President Trump placed blame on Democrats for the standoff, while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett confirmed that preparations for layoffs are underway, pending the president's decision. The stalemate centers on Democratic demands for healthcare funding extensions, which Republicans have so far rejected, creating uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the stock market has shown resilience, with the S&P 500 reaching a record high driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks like Nvidia. Investors are largely assuming the shutdown will be short-lived and have minimal long-term economic impact, though the lack of government economic data, like the jobs report, creates some uncertainty. Key events for investors this week include an investor day for Honeywell's spin-off, Solstice, and corporate earnings reports from companies like PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines.

          <p>At their annual party conference, the UK's Conservative party unveiled a stringent immigration plan to remove 750,000 people within five years. Led by Kemi Badenoch, the proposal includes banning asylum claims from those who enter the country without permission and leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to expedite deportations. The plan involves doubling the budget for a rebranded "Removals Force," funded by closing asylum hotels, aiming to deport at least 150,000 individuals annually to their home countries or safe third countries.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of mourners gathered in Salford to attend the funeral for Melvin Cravitz, 66, one of two men killed in the attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue.

Mr. Cravitz was remembered by his community as a kind, loving, and humorous man, as police continue their investigation into the terror-related incident that has deeply affected the local Jewish community.</p>

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common subject of fights among couples is not money or sex, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research suggests that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. To de-escalate conflicts, he advises individuals to become self-aware, apologize for harsh tones, and rephrase their statements, while those on the receiving end should calmly ask their partner to try again.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections in over four decades, employing a complex, indirect voting process due to the country's fragile state after a long civil war. Instead of a public vote, electoral colleges appointed by subcommittees will select 121 members of the new People's Assembly, with an additional 70 members to be appointed directly by the interim president. The process has drawn criticism for its potential for manipulation and for granting excessive power to the transitional leader, raising concerns about its legitimacy.</p>

          <p>After an eight-year absence from film, three-time Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis has returned to the screen in "Anemone," a movie he co-wrote with his son, director Ronan Day-Lewis. In a recent interview, the actor clarified he never intended to fully retire but wanted to explore different kinds of work, including making fiddles. He revealed the primary motivation for his return was the knowledge that his son would be making films, leading to this father-son project about a man living in self-imposed exile.</p>

          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian aerial assault involving over 50 ballistic missiles and hundreds of drones targeted nine regions across Ukraine, killing at least five civilians. The strikes hit civilian infrastructure, with four deaths reported in the western city of Lviv, an area often considered a relative safe haven from the conflict. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the "aerial terror" and reiterated his urgent call for more advanced air defense systems from Western allies to protect Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Wayne National Forest, Ohio's sole national forest, is facing a significant threat after the Trump administration identified it as a site for increased lumber production. An executive order targeting 100 million acres of forest nationwide was followed by a memo establishing an "emergency declaration" to expedite logging in the Wayne, which sits on land reclaimed from early 20th-century coal mining. Environmental groups and local residents express concern that large-scale clear-cutting could release pollutants from the soil into local waterways and increase the risk of fires and flooding.</p>

He argues that the varied cruelty of Israel's military response is a "performative" act intended to signal hopelessness and annihilate the Palestinian story and imagination. While Teebi has observed a significant shift in global public perception over the past two years, he notes that this has not yet translated into meaningful governmental action from Western nations like Canada.</p>

          <p>The massive electricity requirements of AI and data centers are driving a resurgence in nuclear energy, with tech giants like Microsoft and Google investing in both restarting old plants and developing new technologies. This "nuclear renaissance" includes a focus on small modular reactors (SMRs), which are smaller, factory-built units designed for faster and cheaper deployment. A decommissioned plant in Michigan is set to be the first site for SMRs, reflecting a broader shift in public and market perception toward accepting nuclear power as a necessary clean energy source.

A church in Los Angeles held services online after members of its congregation were arrested, with parishioners fearing to leave their homes. This escalation, which includes raids and the detention of individuals with no criminal records, has led to violent clashes and prompted a former ICE attorney to resign, stating the agency's actions no longer feel like protecting the homeland.</p>
