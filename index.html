        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with legislation to fund President Trump's agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts and tax changes, despite facing resistance from within their own party. The bill proposes $880 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade through work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for certain services. While the Congressional Budget Office estimates substantial savings, it also projects that millions more Americans will become uninsured as a result of the proposed changes. The bill also addresses tax provisions, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and adjusting the state and local tax deduction cap, further complicating its path to passage in Congress.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' aviation council has determined that Russia was responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, which resulted in the deaths of all 298 people on board. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) stated that Russia failed to uphold its obligations under international air law, a ruling welcomed by Australia and the Netherlands, who launched the case in 2022. While the ICAO lacks regulatory powers, its decision is a significant step toward achieving justice and accountability for the victims and sends a clear message against violating international law. Russia has rejected the conclusions, calling them biased, and continues to deny responsibility for the incident.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian testified in a Paris court regarding the 2016 armed robbery in which $10 million worth of jewelry was stolen from her. Kardashian recounted being tied up and held at gunpoint, fearing for her life during the intrusion, and her friend Simone Harouche testified about hearing Kardashian pleading for her life during the attack. Ten individuals face charges including robbery and kidnapping, with some admitting involvement in the heist. The robbers, dubbed "the Grandpa robbers" due to their age, remain largely at large, and the jewelry has not been recovered.</p>

          <p>French actor Gérard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and given an 18-month suspended sentence. The Paris court found the women's evidence to be consistent and credible, adding Depardieu to the national sex offender registry and ordering him to pay damages to the victims. The verdict has been hailed as a victory for French women in the post-#MeToo era, marking the end of impunity for artists in the film industry, according to the victims' lawyers. Depardieu's lawyer has stated that he will appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping has proposed expanding trade cooperation with Latin American countries beyond commodities, focusing on emerging areas like clean energy, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence. Speaking in Beijing, Xi emphasized China's role as a reliable partner amidst global turbulence and protectionism, indirectly referencing tariff threats from the Trump administration. The announcement follows a provisional reduction of tariffs between China and the United States, and Xi's remarks signal China's intent to strengthen ties with Latin America as a countermeasure to U.S. influence in the region.

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) voted to void David Hogg's election as vice chair, citing a procedural challenge, although the vote follows internal criticism of Hogg's plans to primary older Democratic lawmakers. Hogg stated the DNC has pledged to remove him, viewing the vote as a fast track to that effort. The decision to potentially remove Hogg comes after he announced plans to spend $20 million to primary older Democratic lawmakers in blue districts to make room for new Democratic leaders. Hogg's strategy sparked controversy, with some criticizing it as divisive and prioritizing internal conflict over defeating Republicans.</p>

Analysts suggest that while food prices will remain stable, core inflation may rise due to increased gold prices, which have surged amid global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Concerns about stagflation, a combination of high unemployment, high inflation, and slow economic growth, are increasing in the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation, although the U.S. economy is currently in a "strong position." Experts attribute stagflation fears to shifting tariff policies, which create uncertainty and can hinder economic growth. Consumers can prepare by paying down high-interest debts and boosting emergency savings, as cash savers have a unique opportunity to access higher returns with interest rates holding steady.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used executive powers to order sweeping cuts to prescription drug prices in the U.S., aiming to align them with prices in other developed countries. The order directs the health secretary to negotiate price reductions with pharmaceutical companies, potentially targeting slimming drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. While the plan has faced skepticism and legal challenges in the past, it keeps pressure on pharmacy benefits managers and aims to allow drugmakers to sell directly to patients. The pharmaceutical industry is likely to resist the changes, warning of potential impacts on investment in research and development.</p>

          <p>Japanese carmaker Nissan is set to cut an additional 11,000 jobs globally and close seven factories as part of a business restructuring in response to declining sales. The company has been affected by falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US, while a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi recently collapsed. These latest cuts bring the total number of layoffs announced by the company in the past year to about 20,000, representing 15% of its workforce. The company also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen.</p>

          <p>A proposed $30 per hour minimum wage for tourism workers in Los Angeles is threatening an 18-story hotel project in Universal City. Hotel executives warn that the wage hike would make it impossible to compete with non-hotel restaurants and spur them to look to other markets for new hotel projects. Proponents argue that tourism workers deserve to benefit financially from the Olympics and dismiss industry warnings as fear-mongering.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing cities and counties to outlaw homeless encampments, moving California closer to criminalizing homelessness. The draft ordinance makes nice talk about not criminalizing folks, but also doesn’t require more than “every reasonable effort” to provide shelter to those being displaced, knowing full well that we don’t have enough shelter beds. Newsom's office took the side of the city of Grants Pass, Ore., filing a brief in support of more enforcement powers. The push comes as Newsom also announced $3.3 billion in funding for mental health facilities, acknowledging the need for a robust community care system.</p>

While some support the change, others express concern about chronic complaints about bad operators who abuse insurance or summarily evict residents who relapse.
