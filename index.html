          <h2>US to Impose 50% Tariff on Copper Imports Starting August 1</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 23:13:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, following a national security assessment. The justification cites copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies, with the metal being the second most used by the Department of Defense. This move caused a significant spike in U.S. copper prices, creating a large premium over global markets. While the administration aims to bolster domestic production, experts caution that increasing U.S. capacity will take years, potentially leading to shortages and higher costs for consumers in the interim.

          <p>Russia has launched another large-scale overnight drone attack on Kyiv, injuring at least 10 people and causing fires in multiple districts. Ukraine's military administration reported that wreckage from the drones struck residential buildings and other structures across the city, prompting air raid alerts and defensive actions from air defense units. The attack follows a previous major assault involving hundreds of drones and missiles targeting cities across Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have urged residents to remain in shelters as they continue to repel the ongoing aerial assault, while also warning of a potential ballistic missile threat.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 23:11:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is set to propose a ban on foreign nationals from claiming sickness and disability benefits as part of a broader plan for welfare reform. In an upcoming speech, she will characterize the UK's rising benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" that threatens the economy. The proposal seeks to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour party, which recently scaled back its own welfare cut plans. Current rules generally allow foreign nationals access to benefits after being granted indefinite leave to remain or refugee status, and the new plan would restrict this to British citizens with some exceptions.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy rate at 2.5% to assess the effects of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% in June, leading to a rapid expansion of household debt and prompting authorities to implement new mortgage lending restrictions. The central bank is prioritizing financial stability over stimulating growth, despite the economy contracting in the first quarter. Analysts anticipate that the bank may cut rates later in the year once the housing market stabilizes, but concerns over high household debt, partly driven by the unique "jeonse" rental deposit system, remain a key consideration.

          <p>President Trump announced a potential 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, linking the trade measure to the country's criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter, Trump condemned the proceedings against Bolsonaro as a "Witch Hunt" and an "international disgrace," demanding they cease immediately. The threat is notable as the U.S. currently runs a trade surplus with Brazil. Brazilian President Lula da Silva rejected the demands, asserting the independence of Brazil's judiciary and stating that any unilateral tariffs would be met with reciprocal measures under Brazilian law.

          <p>A new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam highlights severe wealth inequality in Africa, revealing that the continent's four wealthiest individuals possess more wealth than the poorest 750 million people combined. The collective wealth of Africa's 23 billionaires has surged by 56% over the past five years, now totaling $112.6 billion. The report argues that government policies favoring the rich and ineffective progressive taxation systems exacerbate this disparity. Oxfam suggests that modest wealth and income taxes on the richest 1% could generate enough annual revenue to fund universal education and electricity access across the continent.

          <p>Recent major floods in New Mexico and Texas have yielded starkly different results, underscoring the critical role of community preparedness and prior experience. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, which was still recovering from wildfires that increased flood risk, residents and officials were largely prepared, resulting in fewer casualties despite significant property damage. Conversely, the ferocity of the flooding in Texas caught many by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll of at least 119 people. Experts suggest that recent experience with a specific type of disaster, like the post-fire floods in New Mexico, significantly informs and improves a community's response to subsequent events.</p>

A key sticking point in negotiations is the proposed presence of the Israel Defense Forces within Gaza during and after a ceasefire.

Prices for the metal have already surged in anticipation of the new duties. While the administration argues the tariff will revive U.S. manufacturing, experts counter that ramping up domestic production would take years, and in the meantime, increased costs would likely be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation.

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, in response to her investigations and criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza. U.S. officials accused Albanese of threatening U.S. national interests by calling on companies to stop doing business with Israel and recommending prosecutions by the International Criminal Court. The move is the latest escalation in the administration's campaign against international bodies and officials it deems critical of Israel. Supporters of Albanese, including Amnesty International, condemned the sanctions as an attempt to silence scrutiny and undermine international law.</p>

          <p>Former Representative George Santos, just before beginning a seven-year prison sentence for fraud, made a new, unsubstantiated claim on social media. Responding to a follower who wondered why he wasn't pardoned, Santos alleged that House Speaker Mike Johnson had intervened and blocked President Trump from granting him one. This assertion was met with widespread skepticism, as the House Speaker has no formal power to block a presidential pardon. Before making the claim, Santos posted a message stating he was not suicidal or depressed, asking his followers to be suspicious of any reports to the contrary that might emerge during his incarceration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 positions at NASA, targeting mostly senior-level employees with specialized and management expertise. According to documents obtained by Politico, the move is part of a wider government effort to reduce the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. These cuts would deprive the space agency of decades of institutional knowledge, particularly in core mission areas like science and human space flight. This news comes as NASA is already facing proposed budget cuts and is operating without a confirmed administrator, creating significant uncertainty for the agency's future programs.</p>

Despite the National Weather Service issuing multiple warnings, including a "PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION" alert, local officials failed to activate their system in a timely manner.

A large portion of this year's cases are linked to a significant outbreak in West Texas, which resulted in the deaths of two children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of this highly contagious virus to declining vaccination rates in certain communities, as herd immunity requires a vaccination rate of at least 95%.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs of federal workers. The legal challenge was brought by a coalition of labor unions who argued the president's executive order to slash the federal workforce exceeded his authority. The high court's decision allows the administration to resume its efforts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to reorganize and significantly reduce the size of the government. In a dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson criticized the court for greenlighting the president's "legally dubious actions" in an emergency posture.</p>
