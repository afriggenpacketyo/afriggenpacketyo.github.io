          <p>A Cygnus cargo ship from Northrop Grumman, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, is set to arrive at the International Space Station after a delay. The rendezvous was postponed when two engine burns were prematurely shut down by a conservative software safeguard. NASA confirmed the issue has been resolved and the spacecraft is operating as intended. Astronauts Jonny Kim and Zena Cardman will use the station's robotic arm to capture the Cygnus XL, an upgraded, larger version of the craft making its maiden flight. The mission is crucial for restocking the station with consumables, spare parts, and research materials.</p>

          <p>A shooting in Codorus Township, Pennsylvania, resulted in the deaths of three police officers and left two others in critical but stable condition. The incident occurred as officers were conducting a follow-up on a domestic-related investigation. The suspected gunman was killed by police during the confrontation, and authorities have stated there is no ongoing threat to the community. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro described the event as a tragic and devastating day for the state. An investigation involving state and local police, as well as federal agencies like the FBI and ATF, is currently underway.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his plan to label the decentralized, far-left movement known as antifa a "major terrorist organization." The announcement raises legal questions, as there is no domestic terrorism statute equivalent to the one for foreign entities, partly due to First Amendment protections. Trump's former FBI Director, Christopher Wray, previously described antifa as an ideology rather than a structured organization. This move follows a similar proposal from 2020 and has been praised by Republican senators who introduced a resolution to make this designation in 2019, citing a need to address the movement's violent actions.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil to either Algeria or Syria, ruling that he intentionally omitted key information from his U.S. green card application. The judge cited Khalil's failure to disclose an internship with a UN agency and his affiliations with an anti-Israel campus group as grounds for removal. Federal authorities argued these omissions posed national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil, who was previously arrested by ICE and detained for several months, plans to appeal the decision, with his legal team framing the case as retaliation for his political speech.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has formed a coalition with over 40 conservative organizations, including the America First Policy Institute and Turning Point USA, to create civics programming for the nation's 250th anniversary. The initiative, named the America 250 Civics Education Coalition, aims to renew patriotism and promote understanding of America's founding principles in schools. While details are still being developed, planned programming includes a 50-state college speaking tour. The partnership comes as the Trump administration works to reduce the department's federal oversight, despite laws prohibiting federal control over school curricula.</p>

          <p>Asian markets showed mixed results after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an expected interest rate cut, which Chairman Jerome Powell described as a risk management measure. Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark surged to a new record, rising nearly 0.6%, with technology and real estate sectors leading the gains. Meanwhile, markets in Hong Kong and mainland China saw slight declines, while South Korea's Kospi edged higher. The Fed's move, along with indications of two more potential cuts this year, has shifted focus to the Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting, where rates are expected to remain steady.

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Consume Alcohol Equivalent to Two Cocktails Daily from Fermented Fruit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume a significant amount of alcohol through their diet of ripe, naturally fermenting fruit. By testing the figs and plum-like fruits that chimps eat, scientists determined the average alcohol content and calculated the primates' daily intake. The study found that a chimp consumes about 14 grams of ethanol per day, which is roughly equivalent to two standard alcoholic drinks for a human. This finding provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests our own attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has urged the government not to scrap Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs), which are legal documents outlining support for children with special educational needs. The Education Select Committee's report calls for keeping EHCPs as a crucial accountability measure for parents. It also recommends establishing new national minimum standards for special needs support in all schools and increasing training for teachers. This comes as the government prepares to announce reforms to a system that has been described as financially unsustainable, despite a rising number of children requiring such plans.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Board of Education has unanimously voted to retain Superintendent Alberto Carvalho for another four years, ensuring leadership stability for the nation's second-largest school district. Carvalho, who has been in the role since 2022, stated that he will not seek a raise on his $440,000 annual salary. His tenure has been marked by challenges including post-pandemic academic recovery, a major cyberattack, and increased immigration enforcement affecting student families. The board cited steady leadership and an upward trend in student performance as key reasons for the contract extension, which was praised by several local civic groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from the California Budget and Policy Center, California continues to have the highest poverty rate in the United States, tied with Louisiana. In 2024, approximately 17.7% of residents, or 7 million people, were unable to afford their basic needs. The report attributes the persistently high rate to the expiration of pandemic-era aid policies, such as the expanded federal child tax credit, which had previously led to a historic low in 2021. The authors warn that recent state and federal budget cuts to social safety net programs are likely to exacerbate the problem further.</p>

Trump had claimed that the state was in the final stages of approving low-income housing in the affluent area, which was recently affected by a major firestorm. However, the governor's office clarified that an executive order actually gives local governments the ability to limit such new developments in burn scar areas. Furthermore, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has explicitly banned new duplex project applications within the Palisades burn zone, directly contradicting Trump's assertion.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 0.25% is viewed as a moderate response to a weakening labor market, but it is unlikely to satisfy President Trump's demands for more aggressive cuts. This analysis article suggests the move highlights the ongoing tension between the central bank's independence and political pressure from the White House. The administration's recent appointment of a White House economic adviser to the Fed board and its attempt to oust another governor are testing the institution's autonomy. The modest cut reaffirms the Fed's current restraint, but the conflict is expected to deepen.</p>

Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official target, the central bank is unlikely to risk another cut this year.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against making drastic portfolio changes. He argued that the move was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter the major themes driving the market, such as the strength of technology and artificial intelligence sectors. Cramer suggested that the mixed market reaction, which saw the Dow rise while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell, may have been due to some investors hoping for a more aggressive cut. He concluded that the Fed's prudent, steady approach was exactly what the economy needed. (not investment advice)</p>
