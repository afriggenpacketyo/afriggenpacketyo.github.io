          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in several U.S. cities that will allow women and non-binary riders to request women drivers, and vice-versa. This "women rider preference" feature aims to enhance safety and comfort on the ride-hailing platform, addressing long-standing concerns about sexual assault and harassment. While not a guarantee, the tool increases the likelihood of a match. The company has previously tested similar features in approximately 40 other countries, starting with Saudi Arabia in 2019 after women gained the right to drive there.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing for Bryan Kohberger, who murdered four University of Idaho students, the two surviving roommates delivered powerful victim impact statements. Dylan Mortensen described Kohberger as a "hollow vessel" and spoke of the profound trauma and fear that has shattered her life since the attack. Through a friend, Bethany Funke recounted her cherished memories of her friends and expressed the immense guilt and terror she continues to experience. Both statements highlighted the devastating and permanent loss inflicted upon them and the victims' families.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with a Japanese delegation, President Donald Trump announced a major trade deal, but photographs of his briefing card revealed handwritten alterations and discrepancies. The card showed a $400 billion investment figure crossed out and replaced with "500," while Trump later claimed a $550 billion investment on social media. Similarly, the card detailed a 10% tariff plus a 15% levy on specific industries, but the president only mentioned a flat 15% tariff. The last-minute changes left Wall Street analysts and officials confused about the deal's actual terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that Tehran will not abandon its nuclear program, asserting its capabilities reside in its scientists' knowledge, not just facilities. While claiming Iran rejects nuclear weapons for strategic and religious reasons, he emphasized that the nation is "fully prepared" for any new military confrontation with Israel. These comments come as European, Russian, and Chinese diplomats engage with Tehran to discuss nuclear negotiations amid threats of snapback sanctions if an agreement is not reached soon. The president expressed low optimism for the current ceasefire with Israel holding.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer advertisement, ruling it was "irresponsible" for featuring a model who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog noted that the model's pose, clothing, and pointed shoes accentuated her slenderness, and her head seemed disproportionate to her body. M&S defended the ad, stating the model was healthy and the pose was meant to convey confidence, not slimness, but has since removed the image. This action follows a similar ban on an ad from retailer Next for similar reasons.</p>

          <p>As rising interest rates and tighter lending standards make it harder for homeowners to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), financial experts advise on next steps. If denied, borrowers should first ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to high debt-to-income ratios or low credit scores. Proactive strategies to improve approval odds include checking credit reports for errors, reducing existing debt, and shopping around with different lenders. Experts also suggest considering alternatives like home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the slowdown in sales, the median home price rose 2% year-over-year to a record high of $435,300, driven by a persistent undersupply of available homes.

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will implement a "low double-digit" price increase across its portfolio of confectionary products, including brands like Reese's and KitKat. The company attributes the price hike directly to the "unprecedented cost of cocoa," which has skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa caused by climate change-related weather events and disease. Global cocoa prices have surged over 70% in the last five years. In response, Hershey also plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of a broader strategy to become a "snacking powerhouse."</p>

          <p>A classical music concert at the Reggia di Caserta palace near Naples, Italy, has been abruptly canceled following a public outcry over the scheduled appearance of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev. Gergiev, a known public supporter of Vladimir Putin, has faced widespread criticism and cancellations across Europe since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Opponents, including Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late opposition leader, argued that welcoming him legitimizes the Russian government. The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the cancellation as "cultural censorship," while advocates hailed it as a stand against dictatorship.</p>

          <p>Retail traders, largely coordinating on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, have targeted GoPro and Krispy Kreme, causing their stock prices to soar dramatically. Shares for the wearable camera company and the doughnut chain, both relatively low-priced stocks with significant short interest, jumped 56% and 18% respectively in morning trading. This speculative frenzy follows a pattern seen with previous meme stocks like GameStop, where online communities rally to drive up the value of heavily shorted companies. The activity coincides with a broader market rally, reflecting a heightened speculative mood among some investors on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

The company stated that an internal investigation found the men were encouraging employees to slow down operations in a show of support for the suspended CEO, Arthur T. Demoulas. The firings escalate an internal power struggle reminiscent of the 2014 employee walkout. The two terminated executives plan to hold a press conference to present their side of the story.</p>

          <p>A recent announcement that Vladimir Lenin's tomb in Moscow's Red Square will close for extensive repairs until 2027 has sparked a new surge of visitors. For decades, the preserved body of the Soviet Union's founder has been a unique, if somber, attraction. After a period of post-Soviet indifference, long lines have returned, filled with a mix of soldiers, families, and tourists. The renewed interest seems driven less by political nostalgia and more by a desire for a final look at the historical curiosity, amid ongoing speculation that he might one day be permanently buried.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Barbados have rediscovered the world's smallest-known snake, the Barbados threadsnake, which had not been seen for almost 20 years and was feared to be extinct. The tiny snake, which can fit on a coin and grows to only four inches, was found by a research team under a rock in a small forest. First identified as a unique species in 2008, the blind, burrowing snake eats termites and ants. Conservationists are hopeful that the rediscovery of this rare endemic species can serve as a catalyst for protecting the island's remaining wildlife habitats.</p>

Speaking on the chamber's 25th anniversary, she noted that while the past 50 years of bilateral relations created immense value for both sides, the situation is changing. She warned that if intense competitive pressure from China leads to significant losses for European companies, the fundamental benefits of the relationship will be questioned.

Debt consolidation, using tools like personal loans or balance transfer cards, can simplify payments and lower rates for those with good credit. For others, a formal Debt Management Plan through a credit counselor can negotiate better terms, while debt settlement or, as a last resort, bankruptcy, offer more drastic solutions for overwhelming debt.

For decades, the sugar lobby has benefited from government policies, including high tariffs that keep domestic prices well above the global average. This move further supports the industry by increasing demand for its product. The shift has surprised and concerned corn farmers and corn syrup manufacturers, who see it as a threat to their market and a contradiction of the president's "American jobs" platform.</p>

Potter called the suggestion "ridiculous," insisting that every player was intent on winning the game.

While the president desires lower borrowing costs, politicizing the central bank could shatter investor confidence in the U.S. economy's stability. This loss of credibility would likely lead investors to demand higher returns on long-term government bonds to compensate for increased inflation risk. Because rates for mortgages and car loans are pegged to these bonds, the president's actions could paradoxically cause the interest rates paid by consumers and businesses to rise.
