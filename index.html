          <p>Federal prosecutors have delivered their closing arguments in the sex trafficking trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, describing him as the leader of a criminal enterprise who used "power, violence and fear." They argued that Combs leveraged his fame, wealth, and employees to facilitate and conceal numerous sex crimes over several years. The defense is scheduled to present its closing arguments next, with jury deliberations expected to begin soon in a case where the music mogul could face 15 years to life in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly declared a significant victory over Israel and claimed to have dealt "a big slap in the face" to the United States. His statements contrast sharply with U.S. and Israeli intelligence assessments, which indicate that joint strikes have severely damaged Iran's nuclear program, setting it back by years. While Khamenei asserted that key facilities were not significantly harmed, an Iranian government spokesperson acknowledged serious damage, and the IAEA has expressed grave concern over Iran halting cooperation with inspectors.</p>

This expansion has led to a 60-fold rise in reported rates, a development Frances suggests was an unforeseen consequence of attempts to improve diagnostic accuracy for the condition.</p>

          <p>Nike has announced that new U.S. tariffs are expected to add approximately $1 billion in costs during the current fiscal year, calling the duties a "new and meaningful" challenge. The company plans to mitigate this impact over time by shifting its supply chain, adjusting prices, and working with partners, aiming to reduce its manufacturing in China. This comes as Nike navigates a difficult turnaround, reporting an 86% drop in profits in its latest quarter while working to clear inventory and reset its business strategy.

          <p>Construction is reportedly underway for a controversial migrant detention facility in Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve, a project Governor Ron DeSantis has dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The plan, which involves housing up to 1,000 people in tents, has drawn sharp criticism from activists, environmentalists, and Native American tribes who consider the land sacred. Opponents also condemn the use of federal hurricane relief funds for the project, calling it a political stunt that wastes resources and poses environmental risks.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Soften Welfare Bill After Facing Rebellion Within Labour Party</h2>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce significant concessions on its planned welfare reform bill to avoid a parliamentary defeat from a large group of Labour rebels. The expected changes will protect existing claimants of disability and health-related benefits, with proposed cuts now only applying to future claimants. This represents a major climbdown for the government and follows pressure from over 100 of its own MPs who opposed the original plan to change qualification criteria for key benefits.</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that the U.S. and China have reached a "framework" agreement, following a sudden announcement by President Trump during a promotional event for a government spending bill. Trump stated that a deal with China had been signed the previous day, though he provided no specific details. The framework is aimed at implementing a trade deal based on bilateral talks that began last month, as the administration continues to pursue new trade agreements with various countries.</p>
