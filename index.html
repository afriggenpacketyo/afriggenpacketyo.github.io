        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors like softer U.S. inflation, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which increased the appeal of alternative stores of value. Cumulative inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $40 billion, with recent risk-off scenarios related to tariffs and deficits also boosting gains. The Senate has advanced legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and Coinbase has joined the S&P 500, signaling a significant milestone for the crypto industry.

          <p>President Trump met with South African President Ramaphosa at the White House amidst tensions over Trump's claims of a "genocide" against white South African farmers, a claim vehemently disputed by the South African government. During the meeting, Trump showed videos and articles he claimed supported his allegations, while Ramaphosa pushed back, stating that the speakers in the videos represented fringe political groups and that crime affects all South Africans, not just white farmers. Elon Musk, present at the meeting, has also amplified claims of "white genocide" in South Africa. The U.S. has fast-tracked Afrikaner refugees under an executive order citing land seizures, a claim South Africa says addresses apartheid injustices. The optimism score reflects the ongoing tensions and potential for diplomatic fallout. </p>

          <p>A Baptist ministry in North Carolina, Welcome House Raleigh, agreed to furnish apartments for Afrikaner refugees, sparking controversy due to the group's historical association with apartheid. While recognizing the ethical complexities, the ministry emphasizes its mandate to welcome and love all people, regardless of their background. This decision contrasts with the Episcopal Church's choice to end its refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government over the resettlement of Afrikaners. The Trump administration's decision to fast-track Afrikaners for resettlement has drawn criticism from refugee advocates who question the prioritization of one group over others facing similar or worse circumstances.</p>

          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 jetliner as a gift from Qatar, and the Air Force has been tasked with determining how to rapidly upgrade it for use as a new Air Force One for President Trump.

Concerns have been raised by members of Congress regarding the speed of the project and potential compromises to security, as well as questions about Qatar's motives for the gift.

The migrants were initially told they were being sent to South Sudan, but officials later stated that South Sudan was not their final destination. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, expressed concern that his order, which required 15 days' notice for deportations to third countries, had been violated and suggested the administration could face criminal contempt charges.

          <p>President Trump has criticized South Africa's land seizures from white farmers, accusing the government of persecution. However, during his first term, Trump used eminent domain to seize land for the U.S.-Mexico border wall, a practice that mirrors the South African policy he condemns. This highlights a contradiction in Trump's approach, as he has long embraced government-sanctioned land grabs both as a developer and as president. While the South African law allows land seizures without compensation under certain conditions, Trump's administration filed over 110 lawsuits against landowners in Texas to secure space for the border wall.</p>

          <p>A Noise Within in Pasadena is staging a revival of "A Man of No Importance," an off-Broadway musical based on the 1994 film about a Dublin bus conductor with a passion for Oscar Wilde and amateur theatricals. The musical explores themes of loneliness, longing, and the transformative power of art. The production centers on Alfie Byrne, who decides to stage Wilde's "Salome" with his local church group, navigating societal objections and personal struggles. The musical celebrates the ability of art to uplift everyday people and enrich their lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would eliminate federal taxes on tip income, following calls from both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. If enacted, workers could deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, provided the tips are reported. While supporters claim it will provide relief to hardworking Americans, analysts note that the benefits may be limited to moderate to middle-income workers, as many lower-income tipped workers already fall below the standard deduction threshold. The policy could also incentivize the introduction of tips in new occupations or income misclassification, according to experts.</p>

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by President Trump are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates and causing turmoil in the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5 percent, and the 30-year yield has jumped above 5 percent, reflecting worries about the administration's tax bill and its potential impact on the federal deficit. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic warned that volatility in the Treasury market could increase economic uncertainty.

          <p>A study has found that clownfish, similar to those in the movie Finding Nemo, are shrinking in size to cope with marine heatwaves. Researchers observed clownfish living on coral reefs in Papua New Guinea losing weight and becoming shorter when ocean temperatures increased in 2023. The findings suggest that animals are shape-shifting to adapt to climate change, and could explain the declining size of other fish in the world's oceans. This adjustment allows the fish to need less food and use oxygen more efficiently.</p>
