        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study across 30 European countries reveals that parents generally find their lives more meaningful than childfree individuals, but report lower life satisfaction, particularly among mothers. The study highlights that family policies and gender equality play a significant role in parental satisfaction levels. Scandinavian countries, with their robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies, show less difference in life satisfaction between parents and childfree people. The findings suggest that societal support and gender equality are crucial for improving the well-being of parents.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a sharp increase in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals. Experts attribute this trend to factors like poverty, malnutrition, and the consumption of processed foods.

There are calls for more comprehensive policies, including free school meal programs and stricter regulations on unhealthy food production and marketing.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, a palliative care physician reflects on how confronting death can clarify one's understanding of how to live fully and authentically. The author shares anecdotes of patients whose terminal diagnoses prompted them to reconsider their priorities and reconcile the differences between the life they had and the one they longed for. Rather than pursuing outlandish bucket list items, many patients seek to fulfill simpler, more meaningful wishes. The piece underscores the importance of living with an awareness of mortality to appreciate the possibility of living freely.</p>

          <p>AVZ Minerals has suspended its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo, encouraged by the US to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. This comes as Washington supports American start-up KoBold Metals, backed by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZâ€™s stake. KoBold aims to invest US$1 billion to develop the project, countering Chinaâ€™s Zijin Mining's control of the northern section. The move reflects a broader effort by the US to challenge China's influence in critical mineral resources.</p>
