          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by Qatar, raising questions about its potential use as the new Air Force One. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the acceptance, stating the Department of Defense will ensure the jet meets security and functional requirements. While President Trump expressed frustration with the slow pace of Boeing's Air Force One conversion, experts estimate converting the Qatari jet could cost over $1 billion and take years. The donation has faced criticism, with some labeling it an effective bribe, though Trump insists it benefits the U.S. government, not him. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has strongly criticized the Trump administration for violating a previous order that barred deportations to countries not their own without proper notice. The article details that the administration deported eight migrants, allegedly to South Sudan, with minimal notice, leading Judge Brian E. Murphy to consider criminal contempt penalties. The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, with U.S. military personnel assisting. Documents indicate the deportees were citizens of various countries and had been convicted of serious crimes, but Judge Murphy emphasized the violation of due process. </p>
