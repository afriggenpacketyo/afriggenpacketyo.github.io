          <p>Amazon's Zoox has officially entered the robotaxi market with its launch in Las Vegas, offering free rides from select locations initially, with plans for broader expansion. The electric robotaxi, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, distinguishes itself from competitors like Waymo and Tesla with its unique design centered around the rider experience. Zoox aims to provide a superior alternative to retrofitted cars, emphasizing safety and user-friendly features. The company plans to introduce an early rider program in San Francisco and testing in Austin and Miami, with a focus on scaling production at its California facility. Zoox aims for profitability sometime between weeks from now and decades from now, which is a wide range. Optimism is high for the future of robotaxis and their potential impact on transportation.</p>

          <p>Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf highlighted a disparity in the U.S. economy, noting that while corporations and higher-income consumers are thriving, lower-income Americans are struggling. He pointed out that lower earners are spending their money as quickly as they get it, resulting in balances below pre-pandemic levels and living on the edge. Scharf's comments follow a Labor Department report indicating a weakening economy and slower hiring rates, and he acknowledged the undeniable data regarding job creation. While acknowledging the current economic positivity, he cautioned that the situation is unequal across wealth spectrums, suggesting more downside than upside. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Klarna, a buy now, pay later company, priced its IPO at $40 per share, exceeding expectations and valuing the Swedish firm at approximately $15 billion. The IPO raised $1.37 billion for the company and existing shareholders, with shares to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "KLAR". Klarna had initially planned to go public earlier in the year but delayed its plans due to trade tariff concerns, and the company has been trying to rebrand itself as more of a digital retail bank. The company reported a net loss in the second quarter, but a rise in revenue from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

The woodland serves as a burial ground, where ashes nourish the soil for growing oak and beech trees. The author contemplates the meaning of home after years of living abroad, acknowledging the privilege of peace that allows for such returns and dignified farewells. The author contrasts this with the experiences of colleagues witnessing the horrors of war, highlighting the importance of cherishing moments of tranquility and connection to loved ones.</p>

          <p>Poland's airspace was violated by multiple Russian drones, prompting a NATO response including the scrambling of Polish and Dutch fighter jets. Prime Minister Donald Tusk reported that drones posing a direct threat were shot down and that Poland requested the invocation of NATO Article 4 for consultations. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte condemned Russia's actions as reckless and affirmed the alliance's commitment to defending allied territory. The Kremlin has not yet commented on the incident, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for consequences for Russia, describing the event as an escalation and dangerous precedent for Europe.

          <p>This article discusses changes to 401(k) catch-up contributions for older workers, particularly those aged 60 to 63. Starting in 2025, workers in this age group can make "super catch-up" contributions, allowing them to defer more into their 401(k). Financial planners recommend this strategy for higher earners looking for a tax deduction. While many retirement plans offer catch-up contributions, only a small percentage of eligible workers actually utilize them. The higher 401(k) catch-up is a great tool in the toolbox.

          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich will merge from 2026 to create the UK's first "super-university". The single institution will be called London and South East University Group, and will have one vice-chancellor from the academic year starting in autumn 2026. The Office for Students has welcomed the move, but the University and College Union told the BBC there would "almost certainly" be redundancies as a result. For students, there will be no visible change, with applications continuing as normal to each institution and degrees awarded in the name of Kent or Greenwich.</p>

          <p>The world is facing a back-to-school crisis, with over 270 million children not enrolled in school, a number that has increased significantly in recent years. Conflict and violence in countries like Sudan, Nigeria, Gaza, Afghanistan, and Ukraine have disrupted education for millions. Cuts to international aid for education are expected to further exacerbate the problem. School is essential for children living through crisis, providing stability, support, and meals, however, progress has been made in the past, and efforts are still underway to keep children learning.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 9,000 positions, or 11.5%, as part of a company-wide transformation. The move aims to simplify the organization, improve decision-making, and reallocate resources towards growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity. The headcount reduction will incur a one-off cost, leading to a revised operating profit growth forecast for the full year. The overhaul marks the first major move by new CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar, following leadership changes and amid increased competition in the weight-loss drug market.</p>
