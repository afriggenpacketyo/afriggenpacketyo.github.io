Factors influencing mortgage rates include inflation, Federal Reserve policy, and the 10-year Treasury bond market. The consensus is that timing the market for the "perfect" rate is risky, and potential homebuyers should focus on their budget and long-term financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump argues that low inflation and declining energy costs warrant lower rates to prevent an economic slowdown. This latest attack comes amid reports that Trump is exploring legal options to remove Powell before his term expires in 2026.
