          <p>ABC has indefinitely suspended its late-night program "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following comments the host made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after major station operators, including Nexstar and Sinclair, announced they would pull the show, citing Kimmel's remarks as "offensive and insensitive." The move has ignited a national debate about free speech, media responsibility, and political pressure on broadcast networks.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has been assigned a U.S. Secret Service protective detail, according to multiple sources. This security enhancement comes in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which has intensified concerns about the safety of high-profile political figures. While not standard for the role, it is not unprecedented, as former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also received temporary protection.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are planning a Friday vote on a short-term government funding measure, with Speaker Mike Johnson expressing cautious optimism about its passage ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline. However, Democrats have signaled strong opposition, stating they will not support a bill that continues cuts to Medicaid and fails to extend Obamacare subsidies. The impasse raises the risk of a government shutdown as the two parties remain far apart on key healthcare and spending provisions.</p>

          <p>The decision by ABC and its parent company, Disney, to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" is being analyzed as a direct result of pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Carr publicly warned that the network could face consequences, stating "we can do it the easy way or the hard way," which was interpreted as a threat to the broadcast licenses of ABC's affiliates. This article argues the incident reflects the leverage the Trump administration holds over media companies, which are often seeking regulatory approval for mergers and acquisitions.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's UK Visit Showcased Warm Royal Relations but Limited British Influence on US Policy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis of President Trump's state visit to the UK concludes that while the trip successfully demonstrated a warm personal relationship with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Royal Family, it did little to enhance Britain's influence on U.S. policy. The author notes that despite the pageantry, Trump's positions on key issues like trade and foreign affairs remain unchanged. The visit appeared to secure a respectful disagreement on certain topics, like Palestinian statehood, without leading to diplomatic penalties for the UK.</p>

          <p>A public dispute has broken out between Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, co-founders of a new left-wing party in the UK. Sultana accused Corbyn and his allies of creating a "sexist boys' club" and excluding her from key decisions after an unauthorized email offered party memberships for sale. Corbyn's camp dismissed the email and membership portal as illegitimate, while Sultana defended her actions as necessary to safeguard grassroots involvement, revealing deep fractures within the nascent political movement.</p>

          <p>During an interview on Fox News, President Donald Trump attacked the network's polling after host Martha MacCallum confronted him with a survey showing 52% of respondents feel the economy is in worse shape under his administration. Trump dismissed the poll, stating he has told Rupert Murdoch to "get yourself a new pollster because he stinks." Instead of addressing the poll's findings on unemployment and grocery prices, the president insisted his tariff policies would lead to a manufacturing boom within a year.</p>
