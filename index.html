          <p>Mark Killick, a builder operating under multiple aliases, has been found guilty of 37 counts of fraud totaling over £1.25 million. He charmed customers across the West of England into paying for home extensions and renovations that were often left unfinished, using the funds for luxury goods like a £25,000 Rolex. This marks his fourth fraud conviction since 2008, with police and Trading Standards describing him as one of the most prolific rogue traders they have encountered, causing vast financial and emotional harm to his victims.</p>

          <p>A second night of disorder outside a Dublin hotel housing asylum seekers has resulted in 24 arrests and injuries to three police officers. The violence, which included throwing stones and fireworks, erupted following a protest over an alleged sexual assault of a young girl in the area. Authorities have described the events as planned online thuggery rather than peaceful protest, seizing 15 scooters and e-bikes during the operation. The unrest has created a traumatic environment for the families, including Ukrainian refugees, living in the hotel complex.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has maintained a conspicuous silence following President Donald Trump's abrupt cancellation of a planned meeting with Vladimir Putin and sharp criticism that their talks "don't go anywhere." This shift in tone came as the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russian oil companies, a move that pro-Kremlin media largely ignored. While some Russian officials expressed readiness for continued contact, former President Dmitry Medvedev accused Trump of fully embarking on a "warpath against Russia," signaling deepening diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>A recent 24-hour hackathon in Singapore brought together over 400 participants, from experienced engineers to first-timers, to build applications from scratch using artificial intelligence. The event aimed to reinvigorate the local "builder spirit," showcasing how AI-assisted coding tools are making it easier for individuals with non-technical backgrounds to create functional products. Organizers noted that this shift lowers the barrier to entry for engineering but raises the bar for product sense and creativity, allowing innovative ideas to be prototyped and developed more rapidly than ever before.</p>

          <p>The semi-truck driver arrested for DUI following a fatal eight-vehicle crash in Ontario, California, has been identified by the Department of Homeland Security as an Indian national who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. The crash resulted in three deaths and four hospitalizations, and the driver, Jashanpreet Singh, faces charges of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. The incident has drawn attention to a recent lawsuit filed against California for allegedly failing to comply with federal safety and immigration requirements when issuing commercial driver's licenses.</p>

          <p>Slovakia, the world's leading car producer per capita, is facing significant challenges that threaten its status as "Europe's Detroit." The country's auto industry, which accounts for 11% of its GDP, is uniquely exposed to U.S. tariffs, with cars making up 80% of its exports to the United States. Compounding this are pressures from Chinese competition, higher domestic taxes, and the current government's euroskeptic and pro-Russia stance, which analysts warn could deter foreign investment and undermine the sector's long-term stability.

          <p>Homeowners in Southern California often face a difficult process when seeking compensation for property damage caused by fallen city-maintained trees. One Burbank resident has been in a year-and-a-half-long legal battle after a dead tree fell on her car, with the city initially denying her claim by citing it as an "act of Mother Nature." Legal experts advise residents to document the condition of hazardous trees with photos and to submit all complaints to the city in writing, as verbal reports leave no record for potential litigation.</p>

          <p>Over 100 firefighters responded to a large, hazardous fire at a General Motors design facility in Pasadena, which involved burning lithium-ion batteries and prototype vehicles. The four-alarm blaze presented significant challenges, as water cannot be used on lithium-ion battery fires, which can lead to chemical reactions and explosions. At one point, a firefighter became trapped inside the smoke-filled building and issued a mayday call but was safely rescued without injury, in what officials called one of the largest structure fires in the city's recent history.</p>
