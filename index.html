          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to reduce its second-class letter delivery schedule to cut costs amid declining mail volume. Second-class letters will now be delivered on alternating weekdays, while first-class deliveries remain a six-day-a-week service. Royal Mail welcomed the change, which it will implement over the next 12-18 months, as a necessary step for financial sustainability. However, consumer groups criticized the decision, citing the company's poor service record and arguing it will not guarantee more reliable deliveries.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian aerial assault involving numerous missiles and drones has struck Kyiv, resulting in at least two deaths and injuring sixteen people. Ukrainian officials reported that wreckage from the attack hit residential buildings and a healthcare center, causing widespread fires across the capital. The attack is one of the largest recent assaults on the city, highlighting the escalating conflict and the diminishing prospects for a diplomatic resolution.

          <h2>New 'Superman' Film Sparks Political Debate Over Superhero's Portrayal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming 'Superman' movie, directed by James Gunn, is generating political controversy for its depiction of the hero as a symbol of 'universal morality' rather than American exceptionalism. The film portrays a battered Superman representing a struggling America, focusing on kindness and protecting the vulnerable globally. This interpretation has drawn criticism from some conservative commentators who label it as 'woke' and call for a boycott. The article explores the long-standing debate over the political undertones in DC and Marvel comics, framing Superman's origins as an immigrant story.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has temporarily stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States, according to media reports. Company sources indicate that high US tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are a key factor in the decision, alongside a safety recall for the vehicle's third-row seats. The move highlights the tangible impact of escalating trade tensions on international corporations and supply chains. This development comes as VW's overall vehicle deliveries to North America have declined in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Soccer's governing body, FIFA, has opened a new office in Trump Tower in New York City, signaling a deepening relationship with President Donald Trump ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the US. FIFA President Gianni Infantino made the announcement alongside Eric Trump, praising the 'big support' received from the Trump administration. This move follows several high-profile appearances by Infantino with Trump and comes as the US government allocates significant funding for World Cup security. The close ties have drawn some criticism within the soccer world, particularly from Europe's governing body, UEFA.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens about an increase in kidnappings, particularly targeting Chinese women. The alert follows multiple recent incidents and a fatal home invasion, highlighting a growing security threat. Analysts suggest Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they carry large amounts of cash and operate outside the formal banking system. The embassy has urged its nationals to avoid going out alone and to take extra safety precautions amid the rising crime wave.</p>

          <p>All 31 construction workers inside a Los Angeles County sanitation tunnel were successfully rescued after a portion of it collapsed deep underground. The incident occurred in a six-mile-long tunnel in Wilmington, with the workers located about 400 feet below the surface. They managed to navigate through the debris to a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to the entrance. No major injuries were reported in what officials called a 'victory' after initial fears of a major tragedy. Work on the project is paused pending a full safety assessment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a federal lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's animal welfare regulations for egg-laying hens are contributing to soaring egg prices nationwide. The lawsuit claims California's rules, which mandate more space for chickens and apply to eggs sold in the state, create 'unnecessary red tape' and violate federal law. This legal action is part of President Trump's vow to lower egg prices, a major consumer concern amid broader inflation. California officials have previously defended the laws as necessary for preventing animal cruelty and foodborne illness.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo vessel, the Eternity C, in the Red Sea, resulting in at least three deaths and a search for missing crew members. The Greek-operated ship was hit by rocket-propelled grenades, and the Houthis claim to have taken an unspecified number of surviving crew. This attack follows the sinking of another ship just days earlier and marks a significant escalation in the group's campaign against international shipping. The US and EU have condemned the attacks, which the Houthis claim are in support of Palestinians.</p>

The move is part of Ferrero's recent expansion strategy, while WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles. The potential acquisition comes as the industry navigates shifting consumer preferences toward healthier options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is set to propose barring some foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits as part of a plan for tighter welfare curbs. In an upcoming speech, she will describe the rising benefits bill as a 'ticking time bomb' that threatens the economy. The proposal seeks to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour government, which recently scaled back its own planned cuts, and from Reform UK. Currently, foreign nationals gain access to most benefits after being granted indefinite leave to remain or refugee status.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5%, opting to hold steady as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures designed to cool Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged significantly in June, prompting authorities to act on expanding household debt. While the economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. Analysts expect the bank may consider a rate cut later in the year, once the impact of new mortgage lending restrictions becomes clearer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent back-to-back floods in New Mexico and Texas produced vastly different results, underscoring the importance of preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where deadly floods occurred, the community was somewhat prepared due to awareness of risks from recent wildfire 'burn scars,' and the town quickly returned to a semblance of normalcy. In contrast, a major flood in Texas just days earlier caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 119 deaths. Experts note that recent experience with a disaster can significantly inform a community's response, making them more likely to heed warnings.</p>
