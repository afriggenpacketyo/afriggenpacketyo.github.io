        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert Griffin III expressed concern about Shedeur Sanders' situation with the Cleveland Browns, suggesting the team has set him up to fail. Sanders, drafted in the fifth round, is the fourth quarterback on the roster, limiting his opportunities. Despite being a popular figure selling tickets and jerseys, Griffin believes Sanders will receive the least amount of reps, creating a dysfunctional environment. The article highlights the challenges Sanders faces in a crowded quarterback room, contrasting his marketability with his limited chances for playing time.</p>

          <p>A judge declared a mistrial in the murder trial of Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a black man, during a traffic stop in April 2022. The jury was unable to reach a verdict, resulting in the mistrial, which is a partial victory for Schurr, who still may face another trial. The incident, captured on multiple cameras, showed Lyoya fleeing from Schurr and a subsequent scuffle over the officer's Taser before Schurr shot Lyoya. Lyoya's death sparked protests and renewed questions about racial injustice and police brutality, and the mistrial comes shortly after the acquittal of three officers in the Tyre Nichols case.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how Donald Trump's focus on individual federal judges is shifting the focus from law and precedent to personalities. This approach undermines the concept of a government of laws and risks delegitimizing the court system. By attacking judges who rule against his policies, Trump seeks to distract from the legal findings that his administration has overstepped its authority. This vilification of public figures also poses a risk of physical harm to judges, who have faced increasing threats.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Rupnow, the father of the teenage girl who killed two people in the Abundant Life Christian School shooting last year, was arrested and charged with multiple felonies.

Rupnow legally purchased the firearm used in the shooting, and his daughter had regular access to a gun safe and other weapons in the home.

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use naloxone, a lifesaving overdose reversal drug. This proposal comes as overdose deaths have recently fallen, partly due to wider naloxone access. Experts warn that cutting this grant could reverse progress made in lowering opioid overdose deaths. The proposed cut is part of a larger effort to reduce the Health and Human Services budget, potentially dismantling essential services and exacerbating the overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on a limited number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. This agreement offers some relief to key UK industries from tariffs imposed by President Trump. While hailed by leaders as significant, analysts suggest it may not substantially alter the terms of trade between the countries. The US has agreed to reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and has slashed tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>World Central Kitchen has been forced to shut down its community soup kitchens across Gaza due to Israel's ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance. The organization, which was serving 133,000 meals per day, reports that there is almost no food left in Gaza to cook with. The closure threatens Gaza's population, already suffering from 19 months of war, with malnutrition and hunger becoming increasingly prevalent. Aid organizations are calling for increased access to humanitarian aid to prevent further suffering.</p>

          <p>Following an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, West Point has been reviewing its curriculum to remove ideologies deemed "divisive" by President Trump, leading to cancelled classes and book bans. The academy's response has shaken the institution, with professors questioning the commitment to academic freedom and some resigning in protest. The order prohibits instruction in "critical race theory" and "gender ideology," and requires teaching that "America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history." The article highlights the challenges of balancing academic freedom with political pressures within a military institution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic data suggests that many companies plan to pass tariff costs on to consumers, potentially driving up prices. Surveys indicate that manufacturers and retailers intend to pass tariff-related expenses to customers rather than absorb the costs internally. Experts predict that tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to boost consumer prices in the months ahead. Despite President Trump's claims that foreign exporters will absorb the higher costs, evidence suggests that American consumers will bear the brunt of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was removed from his position after telling Congress that FEMA should not be eliminated. His ouster came a day after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem testified that FEMA should be eliminated. The debate over FEMA's future dates back to the early days of the Trump administration, with the president expressing frustration over the agency's performance. This situation highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's desire to reduce federal bureaucracy and the need for effective disaster response.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's response to pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupying the main library was markedly different from past incidents, with campus security intervening aggressively. This shift reflects a tougher stance by the university and federal officials towards disruptive protests. The occupation ended with arrests and vandalism to the library. While some praised the university's actions, others criticized the forceful response and the erosion of civil liberties. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses and the debate over free speech versus safety and order.</p>
