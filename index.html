          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary against incumbent Ed Gainey, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city's current progressive leadership. O'Connor, who had support from the party's "old guard" and some Republican donors, will face Tony Moreno in the November election. Gainey, the city's first Black mayor, faced criticism over police leadership turnover and basic service issues. O'Connor campaigned on a pragmatic approach to revitalize the city's tax base and foster better relationships with local institutions.</p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister Taku Eto resigned after facing criticism for stating he doesn't buy rice due to receiving ample gifts from supporters, a remark deemed inappropriate amid rising rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and is expected to replace him with Shinjiro Koizumi. Eto's comments came shortly after the ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year. The incident has further strained public trust in the government, already weakened by political fund scandals.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports to the U.S. have decreased for the first time this year, attributed to trade tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The country's trade surplus with the U.S. has narrowed, and exports of transport equipment, including automobiles, have fallen. The tariffs, including levies on auto, steel, and aluminum exports, are creating challenges for Japanese manufacturers. While Japan is engaging in trade talks with the U.S., a full return to pre-tariff conditions is unlikely, potentially impacting Japan's GDP growth.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers have informed a federal judge that the U.S. government may have deported migrants from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan, a country plagued by conflict and instability. The lawyers argue that such deportations violate a court order that protects migrants‚Äô due process rights. If the removals have occurred, the lawyers said, the migrants would face a high risk of irreparable harm. The Trump administration has been working to convince nations to accept migrants who are not their own citizens.</p>

          <p>Three days after an explosion believed to be intended for a fertility clinic rocked the city of Palm Springs, California, the smell of smoke still filled the air. The suspect, 25-year-old Guy Bartkus was killed in the explosion, the FBI confirmed following DNA testing, and four other people were injured in the explosion. Detectives believe Bartkus acted alone at the site but said they're scouring his online chats to learn whether anyone helped him buy parts or refine the design of the bomb.</p>

          <p>Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell (both out with shoulder inflammation) continued their throwing progressions, with Glasnow making some light pitches off a mound slope for the first time since going on the injured list last month. In a flat-ground throwing session Tuesday afternoon, Ohtani mixed in some breaking pitches for the first time in his throwing program this year. About the only injured pitcher who hasn‚Äôt made recent progress is Evan Phillips, whose original 15-day diagnosis now looks likely to stretch far longer than that.</p>
