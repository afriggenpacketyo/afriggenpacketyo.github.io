          <p>With the Real ID deadline approaching in weeks, a CBS News analysis reveals that many states are not fully compliant with the 2005 law, which requires enhanced identification for airport security and federal buildings. As of mid-April 2025, at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant, potentially causing travel disruptions. The Real ID, marked by a star, requires more documentation than a standard ID. Travelers with non-compliant IDs will face additional screening, potentially causing delays, and may be denied entry if secondary verification fails. States are working to increase compliance, but travelers are urged to plan accordingly.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is struggling due to the US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to a price war among producers. Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, the largest market, prompting companies to cut capital expenditure. The expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS) may slow down this year. BESS prices are predicted to continue falling in the local market, forcing producers to seek alternative markets outside the US due to overproduction in recent years, excess supply has led to cutthroat price rivalry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The Consumer Brands Association acknowledges increasing use of alternatives but defends the safety of current ingredients. Studies have linked synthetic dyes to behavioral issues, and consumer groups have long advocated for bans.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is gathering private medical records from various sources to support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research initiative. The data will provide researchers with access to comprehensive patient information for the first time, with state-of-the-art protections to ensure confidentiality. A new disease registry will also track Americans with autism, integrated into the data. The NIH is planning a rapid timeline to launch the autism research using this data.</p>
