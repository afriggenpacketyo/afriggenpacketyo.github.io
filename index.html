          <p>John Laurinaitis, a co-defendant in the lawsuit accusing Vince McMahon of sexual assault and sex trafficking, has agreed to cooperate with and provide evidence to the accuser, Janel Grant. Laurinaitis, a former wrestler and WWE executive, also reached a confidential settlement with Grant, leading to the dismissal of her lawsuit against him. This development marks a significant step toward holding McMahon and WWE accountable, according to Grant's representatives. McMahon resigned as executive chairman of TKO Group Holdings in January 2024 after the lawsuit was filed.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's stock experienced a significant surge despite the company's decision to slash its profit outlook due to anticipated tariff impacts. The retailer now expects full-year earnings per share to fall between $9.50 and $10.50, a decrease from the previous range of $10.40 to $11.40, due to tariffs, which are expected to negatively impact the business by $50 million. Despite the revised guidance, the company reported fiscal first-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to the initial stock increase. Abercrombie is working to diversify its sourcing network and reduce expenses to mitigate the tariff impact without implementing broad price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials responsible for censoring protected expression in the United States. The policy targets those who issue or threaten arrest warrants against U.S. citizens or residents for social media posts and those who demand American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies. Rubio emphasized that free speech is essential to the American way of life and that foreign governments have no authority over it. The exact implementation of this policy remains to be seen, but it appears to be directed at countries with a history of targeting individuals for criticizing their governments online.</p>

          <p>Namibia held its first national day of commemoration for the victims of the genocide committed under German colonial rule between 1904 and 1908, often referred to as "Germany's forgotten genocide." The event included a candlelight vigil and a speech by President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who pressed for greater reparations from Germany. While Germany formally recognized the crimes as genocide in 2021 and offered €1.1 billion over 30 years, a final agreement has yet to be reached. The Namibian government stated that May 28 holds deep historical significance as it marks the day in 1907 when German colonial authorities ordered the closure of concentration camps.</p>

Manger has been critical of the pardons issued by President Trump to free Capitol rioters, calling it "probably one of my worst days in this job."

          <p>President Trump accused President Putin of Russia of “playing with fire” after Russia launched a large onslaught against Ukrainian cities, bombing mostly civilian targets. Trump claimed that if it weren't for him, Russia would have already experienced “really bad things,” prompting a response from Dmitri Medvedev, who warned about escalating tensions to the point of World War III. The White House has not clarified whether Trump supports a bipartisan effort in Congress to impose sweeping sanctions on Moscow. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, stated that the Russia-Ukraine war is Joe Biden’s fault and that Trump wants a negotiated peace deal.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, has threatened to ban government scientists from publishing in the world’s leading medical journals, branding them “corrupt” and controlled by pharmaceutical companies. Kennedy outlined plans to launch government-run journals that would become “the preeminent journals” because National Institutes of Health funding would anoint researchers “as a good, legitimate scientist.” The second Trump administration has significantly cut scientific research funding, prompting some US scientists to consider relocating abroad.

          <p>A judge ruled that a lawsuit alleging Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency are illegally wielding power over federal government operations can move forward. The lawsuit, filed by several Democratic state attorneys general, claims Trump violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution by giving Musk and DOGE sweeping authority to carry out mass firings, terminate grants and contracts, and access sensitive government data without congressional approval. The ruling highlights conflicting descriptions of the power Musk and DOGE have been given, and how efforts to downplay that power have been undermined by public statements and actions.

The government contends that Combs intimidated Kid Cudi and later directed the destruction of his car out of jealousy.

The simulation, organized by MilSim West, involves teams battling with plastic pellet guns in a dystopian scenario where George W. Bush orders NATO to invade Russia. Participants buy knockoff uniforms, and some acquire gear from military surplus stores that source merchandise directly from Ukraine's battlefields. While the events are intended to be fantasy, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine serves as a reference point for participants choosing their uniforms and equipment.</p>

          <p>Joseph Torigian's forthcoming book, "The Party's Interests Come First," explores Xi Jinping through the biography of his father, Xi Zhongxun, a prominent Chinese politician. The book emphasizes the emotional life of the elder Xi and how his personal tragedies shaped his political convictions, potentially influencing those of his son. Torigian argues that Xi Zhongxun's life provides insight into the nature of the Chinese Communist Party and its evolution throughout the 20th century. The book also examines the personal suffering of the Xi family and how they remained dedicated to the party despite it.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has relaxed barriers in 401(k) plans to buying cryptocurrency and related digital assets, rescinding guidance put in place by the Biden-era Labor Department. The previous guidance cautioned employers to exercise "extreme care" before making crypto investments available to their workers, citing "serious concerns" about the prudence of exposing retirement savings to crypto. The Trump Labor Department has withdrawn that guidance in full, signaling a shift in regulatory approach towards digital assets in retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The movie *Friendship* traces how Craig Waterman, played by Tim Robinson, and his neighbor Austin, played by Paul Rudd, quickly bond and then break apart. The film examines the absurdity of modern male-bonding rituals and the lengths a person will go to in order to get someone else, especially a new friend, to like them. The film often plays like a horror movie and has a nuanced performance that makes *Friendship* somewhat compassionate as a study of how exhausting social mores can be to grasp. The film fearlessly reckons with how confounding people can be in their bid for one another’s approval.</p>

          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges, including declining sales in China, slumping demand for electric vehicles, and new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The 25 percent tariff on all cars imported to the United States, and the threat of a 50 percent tariff for all products from the European Union, have sent Porsche’s shares tumbling. As a result, Porsche has scaled back its forecast for the year by about 2 billion euros. The company is bringing back models with combustion engines and expanding its offering of plug-in hybrid vehicles in response to weaker demand for electric cars.</p>
