          <p>Actress Halle Berry recently celebrated her 59th birthday with a tropical vacation, sharing photos on social media from her getaway with her boyfriend, musician Van Hunt. In one post, she was pictured in red lingerie in a seaside pool, captioning it, "Making the most of a cloudy day." Another post seemed to subtly respond to recent comments made by her ex-husband, David Justice, about his past expectations for a traditional wife. Berry, who has been married three times, has stated that she and Hunt do not feel pressure to marry to validate their long-term relationship.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, while South Korea's Kospi index declined. Investor sentiment was cautiously optimistic in early hours, influenced by hopes for potential rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which had contributed to a positive week on Wall Street. U.S. stock indices had ended Friday slightly down as investors secured profits after reaching record highs earlier in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, accompanied by key European leaders, is set to meet with U.S. President Trump in Washington for talks considered pivotal for Ukraine's future. The meeting aims to impress upon the American president that any peace deal with Russia must involve Ukraine directly and be supported by robust security guarantees. This unified diplomatic effort is designed to counter President Putin's influence following the recent U.S.-Russia summit and to navigate the complex proposal of trading Ukrainian land for long-term security against further aggression.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5. This development, described as a "game-changing" concession from the recent U.S.-Russia summit, could provide a pathway to ending the war without formal NATO membership for Ukraine. While Ukrainian and European leaders welcomed the news, they stressed the need for concrete details on how such a pact would function in practice before committing to any broader peace deal.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel engaged in a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations reflect growing public frustration after 22 months of war and recent government plans for a new military offensive in populated areas. Organizers and families of hostages fear further military action could endanger those still in captivity, chanting that a war cannot be won "over the bodies of hostages." Prime Minister Netanyahu, however, criticized the protests, claiming they only benefit Hamas.</p>

A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas, which are expected to receive heavy rainfall. Forecasters state the storm will likely remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of the week.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has added over 6,000 new words this year, including slang terms popularized by internet culture such as "skibidi" and "tradwife." "Skibidi" is a versatile gibberish term from a viral YouTube series, while "tradwife" refers to a traditional wife who documents her domestic life on social media. Other new entries reflect modern work culture, like "mouse jiggler," a device to simulate computer activity, and "broligarchy," describing a small group of powerful male tech leaders.

Authorities will create a DNA database from samples collected from families of suspected victims to aid in identification.

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has sparked significant controversy, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and religious groups. Authorities implemented the ban due to health risks from pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses, but faced protests from citizens, including the Jain community, for whom feeding birds is a pious act. While some of Mumbai's pigeon feeding spots are historic heritage sites, studies show India's pigeon population has surged over 150% since 2000, creating ecological and health challenges. Officials are now considering alternatives like controlled feeding times to find a middle ground.</p>

This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing deals.

This transition is expected to continue improving the company's revenue structure and market position in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming White House meeting between Ukrainian and European leaders with President Trump is fraught with tension, as the unity of the Western alliance against Russia appears increasingly fragile. Following a summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has seemingly shifted his position by abandoning calls for an immediate ceasefire and appearing open to Ukraine ceding territory for peace. This stance has reportedly left Ukrainian officials feeling betrayed and has prompted European allies to rally around President Zelenskyy. The challenge for the delegation is to steer Trump back toward a unified Western strategy without alienating him.</p>

The event, attended by hundreds of thousands, featured the controversial chant "Za dom, spremni" ("For homeland, ready!"), which originated with the World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha regime. While supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, human rights groups condemn it as a fascist slogan.

The country's fertility rate has hit an all-time low, driven by a punishing work culture, a stagnant economy, and shifting social norms that have led to a decline in marriage. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a state-sponsored dating app and shortened workweeks, but these have had little effect. Some politicians now advocate for revitalizing rural areas to create more family-friendly living environments as a potential long-term solution.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old boy was killed in a shooting at a large house party in Covina on Saturday night. Police responded to reports of gunshots and found a large, chaotic crowd that required assistance from three neighboring police departments to control. Witnesses reported that the victim, a resident of La Puente, had been taken to a hospital by other partygoers, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries. No other injuries were reported, and no arrests have been made as of Sunday. Detectives are currently investigating the circumstances that led to the fatal shooting.</p>

          <h2>Goalkeeper Error Proves Costly as Manchester United Lose to Arsenal</h2>

          <p>A critical error by Manchester United's goalkeeper Altay Bayindir led to a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal in their opening match at Old Trafford. Manager Ruben Amorim's decision to start Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana backfired when the Turkish keeper failed to handle a corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score the decisive goal. Despite a more threatening attacking performance from United compared to last season, the team could not find an equalizer. The mistake has renewed debate about the club's goalkeeping situation, a position that has been a point of contention among fans and pundits.</p>

          <p>A 63-year-old American tourist sustained severe injuries after being attacked by a shark while spearfishing near Big Grand Cay in the Bahamas. The Royal Bahamas Police Force reported that the man was taken to a local clinic before being airlifted to the United States for further medical treatment. This incident is the latest in a series of shark encounters in the region, which has one of the world's highest rates of shark attacks, though such events remain rare overall.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that a federal and local law enforcement operation in Washington, D.C., resulted in 68 arrests and the seizure of 15 illegal firearms in a single night. This is part of a broader federal crackdown initiated by President Trump, which includes the deployment of the National Guard and the federalization of the city's police force. The administration states that over 300 arrests have been made since the operation began, targeting homicide suspects and drug traffickers. The move continues to draw criticism from Democrats and local officials who view it as a political stunt and an overreach of federal power.</p>

          <p>Air Canada was forced to suspend its plans to resume operations after its flight attendants' union defied a government-ordered return to work. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated its members would continue their strike, calling the back-to-work order from the Canada Industrial Relations Board unconstitutional and unfair. The strike, which has grounded hundreds of daily flights and stranded over 100,000 passengers, centers on demands for flight attendants to be paid for time spent on the ground. The airline now plans to attempt a resumption of services on Monday evening.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police are assessing an allegation concerning drug-related offenses connected to the BBC show 'Strictly Come Dancing.'

          <p>Serious concerns are growing for the Los Angeles Rams as quarterback Matthew Stafford continues to be sidelined by a back issue with the season opener approaching. The 37-year-old veteran has not taken a single snap in team practices during training camp, and the organization has been tight-lipped about his condition and recovery timeline. In his absence, backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking first-team reps and starting in preseason games. The unresolved situation casts significant doubt on the team's prospects for the upcoming season, as Stafford's health is critical to their Super Bowl aspirations.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a Republican-led special session on congressional redistricting are now beginning to return. By denying Republicans a quorum, the Democrats successfully stalled a plan that would create five new GOP-leaning U.S. House seats. With a new special session underway, some lawmakers are already back in Texas, and it is anticipated that a quorum will be present on Monday. Their return follows a strategic move by California's governor to propose a retaliatory redistricting plan, adding a new dimension to the national political battle over voting maps.</p>
