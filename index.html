          <h2>Intel Reportedly Shows Limited Impact of US Strikes on Iran's Nuclear Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 16:35:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to sources familiar with an early intelligence assessment, the U.S. military strikes ordered by President Trump on Iran's nuclear facilities only set back the program by months, contradicting claims of complete obliteration. The report, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency and U.S. Central Command, indicates that while significant damage was done to above-ground structures, enriched uranium and centrifuges largely remained intact. Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth have maintained that the program was "obliterated," but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused CNN of running a leaked story by a "low-level loser" to demean President Trump and discredit the fighter pilots who conducted the mission. As more information is gathered, the assessment may change. </p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping will not attend the upcoming BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, marking the first time he has missed the annual gathering since becoming China’s leader. Citing a scheduling conflict, Beijing informed the Brazilian government that Premier Li Qiang will lead the Chinese delegation instead, similar to his role at the G20 summit in India in 2023. Officials noted that Xi has met with Brazilian President Lula da Silva twice in the past year, including at the G20 summit and during a state visit to Brasília last November, as well as at the China-Celac forum in Beijing in May. Xi previously missed a BRICS summit in 2023, sending Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in his place without an official explanation.</p>

          <p>French football club Lyon has been relegated to Ligue 2 due to its poor financial state, a decision made by the DNGC, the body overseeing French professional football clubs' accounts. Despite attempts to improve their finances through player sales and the release of high earners, Lyon officials failed to convince the DNGC that sufficient progress had been made. Owner John Textor's Eagle Football Group, which holds a 77% stake in Lyon, reported debts of £422m last October. The club has the right to appeal the decision, and if it stands, Reims will replace Lyon in the top flight. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the history of Iranian leaders using the phrase "death to America" while covertly advancing the country's nuclear program before President Trump ordered strikes on nuclear facilities. The slogan originated in the 1970s during the Iranian Revolution and has persisted through the decades. While some Iranian leaders have claimed the slogan represents opposition to U.S. policies, others have directly associated it with the deaths of American leaders. The phrase has been used during significant events such as the Iran-U.S. hostage crisis, discussions surrounding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and after the U.S. strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently holding approximately 59,000 detainees, a record high, with nearly half lacking a criminal record, indicating an expansion of immigration arrests under the Trump administration. The detention level is at over 140% capacity, exceeding the 41,500 detainee beds allocated by Congress. ICE arrests have averaged around 1,200 daily in June, nearly double the average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration. The increased arrest rate is attributed to large-scale operations supported by multiple federal law enforcement agencies and the reversal of previous administration's limits on who is subject to detention. </p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that Florida will receive federal funds to establish immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." FEMA's shelter and services program will largely fund the effort, aiming to support the mass deportation of criminal illegal aliens. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier stated that the federal government has approved the state's plan to build "Alligator Alcatraz" and other facilities, collectively housing up to 5,000 detainees. The facilities could begin receiving detainees early next month, marking a broader effort by Republican-led states to aid the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Seven people have been charged following a Palestine Action protest in central London, where 13 arrests were made amidst clashes between officers and protesters. The charges include a racially aggravated public order offense, assaulting an emergency worker, and breaching the Public Order Act. The protest occurred after the home secretary announced plans to ban Palestine Action under anti-terror law, a move the group is challenging legally. The protest's location was changed at the last minute due to police restrictions, with supporters gathering to carry signs and Palestinian flags.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that systemic failures at Boeing and the FAA led to the midair blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight involving a Boeing 737 Max jet. Investigators found that Boeing lacked proper safety protocols, relied on untrained workers, and failed to document the reinstallation of the door plug panel. The NTSB also noted that the FAA's oversight was inadequate. Boeing has since announced changes, including enhanced training, and the FAA has increased its oversight of Boeing's production processes.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account, noting that the economic climate has shifted. It calculates that a $10,000 one-year CD at 4.45% would earn $445, while a $10,000 high-yield savings account at 4.30% would earn $430, assuming the rate remains constant. The article notes that CD interest rates are fixed, providing guaranteed earnings, whereas high-yield savings account rates are variable and subject to change. The article concludes that, currently, CDs offer a more beneficial and secure option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Refuses to Commit to NATO's Article 5</h2>

          <p>While en route to a NATO summit, President Trump declined to affirm his commitment to Article 5, the collective defense agreement among NATO countries. Trump claimed that there are "numerous definitions" of Article 5 and stated his commitment to being a friend and helping NATO leaders. He declined to provide an exact definition of his commitment until he arrived at the summit. These comments are likely to raise concerns among other NATO nations.</p>

          <p>The UK government is scheduled to meet with food delivery companies following reports that some asylum seekers are illegally working as couriers. The Sun newspaper reported that Channel migrants were renting out delivery accounts via social media groups, earning up to £1,000 a week. Asylum seekers are not allowed to work for the first 12 months in the UK. The government said it will not stand for it, and Border Security Minister Dame Angela Eagle will meet with companies to discuss the issue.</p>
