          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey faces indictment on two charges: making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice, accusations he vehemently denies. President Trump publicly celebrated the indictment, which aligns with his ongoing efforts to target political opponents. The charges specifically stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he denied authorizing the leak of classified information related to an FBI investigation, reportedly concerning Hillary Clinton. This article highlights that the prosecution's integrity is questioned by legal experts due to Trump's public pressure and the controversial appointment of a new US Attorney with ties to the president. If found guilty, Comey could face up to five years in prison.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are moving to drop charges against Travis Decker, the man accused of killing his three young daughters, after DNA testing confirmed human remains found in Washington state belonged to him. Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison stated that this discovery finally brings a close to the "dark chapter" for the county, though the cause and manner of Decker's death may remain unknown due to the minimal skeletal remains found. Decker, a former Army soldier, was accused of killing 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn, and 5-year-old Olivia, whose bodies were found after their mother reported them missing. The article notes that Decker's ex-wife had previously filed to modify custody due to his worsening mental health.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly called for Microsoft to dismiss Lisa Monaco, its president of global affairs, who previously served as deputy attorney general during the Biden administration. Trump, via Truth Social, asserted that Monaco poses a "menace to U.S. National Security" and claimed she had been stripped of her security clearances and banned from federal properties due to alleged "wrongful acts." This demand comes shortly after the indictment of James Comey, an action Trump had also advocated. The article mentions Microsoft's refusal to comment and its substantial contracts with the U.S. government, alongside a recent decision to restrict cloud services to a unit of the Israeli military.</p>

Only officers in command positions and their senior enlisted advisers are being summoned from across the globe, leading to widespread speculation about the meeting's agenda prior to official disclosure. The article notes that this unprecedented assembly underscores a significant policy shift, reflecting Hegseth's regular message on military values and sparking questions about logistics and costs.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the authority to continue withholding over $4 billion in foreign aid that Congress had already approved. The 6-3 ideological split ruling overturns a lower court order, with the conservative majority citing the President's foreign policy powers over claims by international aid groups. Justice Elena Kagan's dissent criticized the emergency docket process, noting the rapid decision with "scant briefing, no oral argument, and no opportunity to deliberate." This article explains that the administration used a controversial "pocket rescission" authority, a rarely invoked power that allows the president to bypass the legislative branch near the end of a budget year, marking its first use since the 1970s.</p>

          <p>Famed money manager Howard Rubin and his former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, were arrested on charges of sexual assault and trafficking, accused of transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts over a decade. Prosecutors alleged Rubin engaged in abusive acts, sometimes beyond consent, causing significant pain and injuries, and that he discussed hiring a "hit man" against women who had sued him. A federal magistrate judge ordered Rubin detained without bail, citing flight risk and witness intimidation concerns, given his substantial overseas wealth. The indictment describes a "sex dungeon" in a Manhattan penthouse, equipped for various acts, with Rubin and Powers allegedly spending over $1 million to maintain the network.</p>

The article recounts the horrific discovery of four teenage girls—Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, Eliza Thomas, and Amy Ayers—tied up, shot, and the shop set ablaze.

The article details the unusual circumstances, including career prosecutors' reported opposition to the charges and the controversial appointment of Trump's former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, as the U.S. Attorney just days before the indictment. These factors could bolster Comey's defense in seeking to have the charges dismissed, raising serious questions about the impartiality of justice.</p>

          <p>The Carolinas are bracing for potential impacts from a strengthening tropical system, Invest 94L, which is expected to develop into a tropical depression by the weekend. Initial model guidance had the storm staying at sea, but recent runs now project a landfall between Georgia and the Outer Banks, with some indicating it could track over Charlotte. While specific details on intensity and timing are still being determined, Chief Meteorologist John Ahrens anticipates at least a "big rainmaker." The article warns of greater impacts for the Carolinas, including heavy rain, gusty winds, and severe weather from Monday to Wednesday, as this potential storm, named Imelda, emerges during an already active hurricane season.</p>

          <p>New files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, released by Congressional Democrats, name prominent figures including billionaire Elon Musk and Prince Andrew. The documents, obtained from the Jeffrey Epstein Estate, include itineraries and flight manifests, with one entry indicating an invitation for Musk to Epstein's private island in December 2014. A flight manifest also lists Prince Andrew as a passenger on a May 2000 flight with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring to traffic girls. The article notes that Musk previously stated he declined island invitations, and Prince Andrew has denied wrongdoing. Other figures like Peter Thiel, Steve Bannon, and Bill Gates are also mentioned, though it is not suggested they were aware of Epstein's criminal activities.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health policy, driven by the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, reflects a conservative ideology that seeks answers to health and happiness in the past, according to this article. Elizabeth Bruenig notes that RFK Jr.'s lifelong focus on natural purity extends to his views on vaccines and processed foods, capitalizing on widespread distrust in institutions like the HHS and CDC post-COVID. The article explains that while vaccine skepticism once leaned left, it exploded on the right after the pandemic, making MAHA's message resonate with many. Bruenig expresses concern that this skepticism is becoming self-sustaining, warning of potential public health risks from practices like raw milk consumption.</p>

Instead, it will offer a unique selection of innovative drinks, including specialty coffees, smoothies, and cold-pressed juices. The article suggests Daybright could serve as a test market for future nationwide beverage offerings, following a trend seen with other fast-food brands venturing into the beverage industry.

This incident highlights concerns over the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaign and increased ICE operations in Southern California, which have reportedly swept up other U.S. citizens.

The National Guard will serve in unarmed support roles unless local law enforcement requests otherwise. The article notes that this operation, planned for months, is characterized by the governor as a "generational opportunity" to combat crime, despite Memphis's recent progress in reducing violent crime.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) argued to the Supreme Court that President Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged misconduct would not trigger "financial market disaster." Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the court to allow Cook's removal while her lawsuit continues, asserting that recognizing the President's power to remove governors for financial misfeasance would not compromise the Federal Reserve's policy independence. Trump moved to fire Cook in August over mortgage fraud allegations predating her Fed appointment, which she denies. Cook's attorneys countered that allowing her removal would "eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board," risking market chaos. (not investment advice)</p>

Tamura, a former high school football player, left a suicide note expressing anger at the NFL for prioritizing profit over player brain safety, stating, "Football gave me CTE."
