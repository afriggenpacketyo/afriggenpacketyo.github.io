          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its cautious approach as it evaluates the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and improvements in business and consumer sentiment, while also acknowledging that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>White House officials indicated that President Trump is considering options, including direct strikes on Iran, following Israel's attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities. Destroying Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran claims is for civilian purposes, is a difficult task due to the fortification of facilities like the Fordo plant. The U.S. is the only country with the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) "bunker buster" and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber needed to deploy it. Experts suggest multiple bombing rounds and potential ground deployment would be necessary to ensure complete damage, while any U.S. strike could trigger retaliatory actions from Iran, potentially escalating the conflict and drawing the U.S. deeper into a regional war.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection, for HIV prevention, hailed as a potential 'breakthrough' in curbing the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data indicated that the injection provides near-complete protection against HIV infection. The treatment offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada, which faces adherence challenges. However, the high cost of approximately $28,000 a year could limit access, especially in countries with a high HIV burden, despite efforts by Gilead to broaden access through licensing agreements and at-cost provisions.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene, though she was convicted of driving while intoxicated. The trial garnered significant public attention, resulting in an upcoming Netflix documentary. Outside the courthouse, supporters chanted "Free Karen Read" and expressed their support, while Read thanked them and stated that no one has fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than she has. Read will avoid jail time due to a one-year probation order for the intoxication charge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law banning certain gender-affirming care treatments for minors. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, stated that the law did not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment, leaving policy questions to elected representatives. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing the law amounted to "sex-based classification" and would authorize "untold harm to transgender children and parents." The decision marks the first time the justices have weighed in on an anti-trans state law, with Tennessee being one of 24 states with such laws in effect.</p>

          <p>A keynote speech at UCLA's Humanities commencement ceremonies, delivered by Caribbean Fragoza, sparked controversy after she donned a keffiyeh and used the slogan "From the river to the sea," which is widely seen as a call for the eradication of Israel. The speaker's message emboldened the audience to boo when graduates in Jewish Studies and Hebrew were called to the stage. The author of the article argues that this was not merely a failure of decorum, but an indictment of the academy itself, suggesting that UCLA's commencements have descended into ideological theater.</p>

While these bombs could cause significant damage, experts question whether it would be enough to halt Iran's nuclear program.

          <h2>Potential Radiation Release from Bunker Buster Strike on Iranian Nuclear Site Assessed</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts assess the potential risks of radiation contamination if the U.S. were to use a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant. Fordo processes uranium isotopes, primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride, a heavy gas molecule unlikely to travel far. Experts believe any contamination would likely remain localized to the site. Although uranium isotopes are at the low end of hazard for radioactive materials, uranium hexafluoride gas can react with water to form hydrofluoric acid, an acutely hazardous material. The underground location of the facility would likely inhibit any significant environmental release.</p>
