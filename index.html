          <p>Manchester Originals secured a significant 57-run victory over the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred cricket tournament, largely thanks to a hat-trick by bowler Sonny Baker. The 22-year-old, who was recently called up for England's national squad, took three key wickets to help dismiss the Superchargers for 114. The Originals' innings was anchored by Jos Buttler's unbeaten 64 and a late surge from Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 50 not out. This win moves the Manchester team into a stronger position in the tournament standings.</p>

          <p>Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn addressed the controversy surrounding his "AI-first company" memo, stating that the announcement was misunderstood due to a lack of context. He clarified that the internal shift towards prioritizing artificial intelligence was not intended to signal layoffs of full-time employees, a group he says has never been downsized. While acknowledging fluctuations in the contractor workforce, von Ahn emphasized that the goal is to leverage AI for innovation, not to replace human workers. The company continues to encourage AI experimentation with dedicated weekly time for its teams.</p>

While its maximum sustained winds have decreased, the storm's overall size has grown, prompting a tropical storm warning for the Turks and Caicos Islands. The hurricane is bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, though it is not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast. Forecasters note the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which could lead to fluctuations in its strength.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Democratic Representative Jason Crow strongly criticized the Trump administration's recent diplomatic engagement with Russia regarding the war in Ukraine. He labeled the summit a "historic embarrassment," arguing that the administration is failing to apply meaningful pressure on Vladimir Putin through economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, or military support for Ukraine. Crow asserted that had the U.S. provided more aggressive aid to Ukraine earlier, the country would be in a stronger battlefield position today.

          <p>Air Canada announced plans to resume operations after the Canadian government stepped in to end a flight attendant strike that began Saturday morning, stranding over 100,000 travelers. The government ordered the striking workers back to their posts and referred the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for binding arbitration, citing risks to the economy. Despite the airline's statement, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, representing the 10,000 flight attendants, stated that demonstrations will continue as they demand a fairly negotiated contract. The primary points of contention remain pay and compensation for unpaid work hours.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Kyiv and Moscow. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rubio emphasized that if one side were to get everything it wanted, it would be a surrender, which neither party is close to. He mentioned that the recent summit with Vladimir Putin yielded some potential for breakthroughs, which will be discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. Key areas for negotiation include security guarantees for Ukraine, territorial boundaries, and the country's reconstruction.</p>

Witkoff described this as a "game-changing" concession, marking the first time Russia has reportedly accepted such a proposal, which could resolve a major obstacle in peace negotiations. This development could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to formal NATO membership for Ukraine.

Instead of elimination, the draft calls for more targeted pesticide applications and the development of a government-wide definition for "ultra-processed food."

Historically, top government positions in autonomous regions were often held by non-Han officials to promote inclusion.

          <p>While markets remained relatively calm, recent inflation data has some economists on edge about underlying price pressures in the U.S. economy. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for July surged to a three-year high, driven largely by services inflation, a trend also seen in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI). This reversal from previously softening services prices complicates the Federal Reserve's position, as it weighs the need for potential rate cuts to support a cooling labor market against the risk of inflation becoming entrenched. Some economists argue the broad-based pressures might even warrant holding off on cuts or considering a rate hike. (not investment advice)</p>

The analysis contends that President Trump failed to secure his primary goal of a ceasefire and instead accepted Putin's framing that a full peace agreement must come first. By engaging in the bilateral meeting, Putin undermined Western efforts to isolate him and sowed further distrust between the U.S. and its European allies.

City leaders from Seattle, Minneapolis, and elsewhere state that Trump is using crime as a pretext to override local authority and create chaos for political gain. They are coordinating with police chiefs and governors and preparing legal challenges should the administration attempt to deploy federal assets without local consent. While acknowledging ongoing challenges with crime, the mayors argue that federal overreach is illegal and counterproductive to public safety.</p>

          <p>Evie Parts, a transgender long-distance runner, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, Swarthmore College, and members of its athletic department, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team. The suit argues the NCAA, as a private organization, cannot legally enforce its ban on transgender athletes in women's sports over federal Title IX protections and state law. Parts was removed from the team the same day the NCAA issued its new policy, an action her lawsuit claims caused severe emotional distress. Swarthmore College later reinstated her, and she competed on the women's team until her graduation.</p>

          <p>Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is identified as a stock that could see significant gains, particularly if its oral weight-loss drug candidate performs well in upcoming phase 2 trials. The company is competing in a market dominated by giants like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk but has an opportunity following a less-than-stellar trial result for Lilly's own oral candidate. Viking's primary drug, VK2735, has already shown strong data in its injectable form and is also being developed as a treatment for MASH, a liver disease with a large unmet need. The stock is considered a higher-risk but potentially high-reward investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece calls for Chinese authorities to strictly adhere to legal processes when investigating business figures, following a concerning string of apparent suicides among prominent entrepreneurs. The article highlights the case of Wang Zongnan, who died just days after being released from detention by anti-corruption investigators. It argues that while China's private entrepreneurs are resilient, the pressure from prolonged and opaque investigations can be overwhelming. The author suggests that protecting entrepreneurs and supporting the private sector requires a commitment to lawful and transparent conduct from the state's disciplinary bodies.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals a significant portion of the German public anticipates the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into executive power. According to the survey, 43% of respondents expect the AfD to appoint a state premier in at least one of Germany's states by next year. The poll also found that while nearly half of Germans support the "firewall" policy of mainstream parties refusing to form coalitions with the AfD, 40% oppose it. This reflects the AfD's sustained pressure on the ruling center-right coalition as it consistently polls strongly at the national level.</p>

          <p>Community violence prevention advocates are criticizing the Trump administration's focus on a militarized law enforcement response to crime in major cities, arguing it ignores proven strategies. They contend that the president's rhetoric dismisses the progress made by community-based intervention programs, which work directly with individuals most likely to be involved in violence. Leaders in the field state that long-term safety is built through investment in local infrastructure and programming, not just police response. The criticism is sharpened by the administration's recent decision to cut nearly $170 million in federal grants to gun violence prevention organizations across the country.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell case, stating the documents contain no significant new information. Judge Paul Engelmayer asserted that the transcripts, which primarily feature testimony from two law enforcement officers, are not an "untapped mine lode" and that releasing them would leave the public feeling "disappointed and misled." This decision has renewed questions about whether other investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking network will ever be made public, with critics arguing the Trump administration has the power to release non-grand jury documents but has failed to do so.</p>
