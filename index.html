          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued a sharp rebuttal to an op-ed by six former U.S. surgeons general that criticized Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health policies as an "unprecedented" threat. The former officials cited Kennedy's promotion of vaccine misinformation and other unproven treatments as dangerous to the nation's health. In response, an HHS spokesperson accused the former surgeons general of presiding over the decline of public health and defended Kennedy's efforts to reform what it calls broken health systems.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service announced it will furlough approximately 34,000 employees, nearly half its staff, due to the ongoing government shutdown. The move is expected to significantly hamper the agency's ability to provide assistance to taxpayers, with the National Treasury Employees Union warning of increased wait times and service backlogs. This development heightens the impact of the shutdown on essential government services as lawmakers remain at an impasse over a funding agreement.</p>

          <p>Former Penn State and Ohio State football player Julian Fleming has been charged with homicide by vehicle and DUI following a fatal ATV crash in May that killed his 23-year-old girlfriend, Alyssa Boyd. According to police reports, Fleming's blood-alcohol level was .118 shortly after the crash, which occurred when they struck a deer on a rural road. Fleming's attorney argues that the incident was a tragic accident and that the facts do not support a criminal homicide charge.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate once again rejected competing Republican and Democratic proposals to fund the government, marking the sixth failed vote and extending the shutdown into its eighth day. With no clear path forward, both parties continue to blame each other for the impasse, which centers on disagreements over spending levels and policy riders related to healthcare. The continued gridlock leaves federal agencies shuttered and hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed without pay.</p>

          <p>For homeowners considering borrowing options, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is currently a significantly cheaper alternative to a credit card. The average credit card interest rate stands at 22.25%, nearly three times higher than the median HELOC rate of 7.89%. Furthermore, the interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if the funds are used for qualifying home improvement projects, a benefit not offered by credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

His case is one of approximately 10,000 from former personnel suing the MoD over hearing damage.</p>
