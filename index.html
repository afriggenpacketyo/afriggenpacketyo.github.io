            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are facing increasing pressure from his own allies, supporters, and donors, who fear the economic consequences of a prolonged trade war. Billionaires like Ken Langone and Bill Ackman, along with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, have voiced concerns about the tariffs slowing down growth and negatively impacting citizens. Even Elon Musk has privately and publicly urged Trump to reconsider, advocating for a zero-tariff situation between Europe and North America. The market volatility and potential recession risks are fueling the opposition, with some questioning the constitutionality of Trump's actions on tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The price of gold initially surged as investors sought a safe-haven asset amid the escalating tariff war between the U.S. and China, but later experienced a slump due to short-term sell-offs by traders covering losses in other asset classes. Analysts suggest that gold remains a viable option for mitigating losses during periods of market volatility, as it is an easily liquidated asset. Trump's tariffs have triggered a downturn in global financial markets, and the sell-off in gold is expected to be a short-term response to these market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Economists are raising concerns that President Trump's tariffs could potentially tip the world into a recession, with Goldman Sachs increasing the odds of a U.S. recession to 45%. JPMorgan is projecting a 60% chance of a U.S. and global recession, along with rising inflation. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies is causing damage, as businesses struggle to determine whether the tariffs are a negotiating tactic or a permanent shift in globalization. While the U.S. economy is not currently in recession, the potential impact of tariffs is causing alarm among economists and market analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The IRS has agreed to share data with ICE to assist in identifying and deporting immigrants residing illegally in the United States. This agreement, formalized in a memorandum of understanding, allows ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants to the IRS for cross-verification with tax records. The Treasury Department argues that this action supports President Trump's border security agenda, but critics contend it violates privacy laws. Concerns are raised about potential breaches of taxpayer privacy and the risk of civil and criminal penalties for IRS officials involved in the data sharing.</p>

Measures under discussion include a global marine fuel standard and a carbon credit scheme. If implemented, a carbon tax would be a landmark climate deal, but concerns remain due to U.S. tariffs, trade war tensions, and opposition from some member states.</p>

            <p>Sarah and Gordon Brown's personal tragedy of losing their daughter Jennifer led them to establish the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory, dedicated to understanding the causes and consequences of premature birth. The Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort, a key project of the lab, tracks the development of 400 children from birth to adulthood to study the long-term effects of preterm birth. Research has revealed the significant impact of poverty on brain development, emphasizing the need for comprehensive support for vulnerable families. The Browns' efforts aim to improve the prospects for children born prematurely.</p>

Schools are implementing measures to combat derogatory language and online hate, while teachers express concern about the normalization of misogyny in online spaces. The government has issued guidance for teachers on dealing with extreme ideologies, but teachers call for broader guidance on misogyny in relationships, health, and sex education. The impact of online content promoting harmful ideologies on young people's mental health is a growing concern.</p>
