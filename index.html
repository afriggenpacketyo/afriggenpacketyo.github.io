          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of semiconductors. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, is centered on producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips at Samsung's new facility in Texas. Musk emphasized the strategic importance of the partnership, suggesting the deal's value could ultimately exceed the initial figure and noting his personal involvement in accelerating manufacturing efficiency. This agreement is crucial for Tesla's AI development and a significant order for Samsung's foundry business.</p>

          <p>Despite the England women's national team securing a historic victory in the Euro 2025 final, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a celebratory bank holiday. A homecoming parade is scheduled, and the team will be honored with a special reception. The decision aligns with past precedents, such as the 2022 Euros win and the 1966 men's World Cup victory, with government officials likely considering the significant economic cost of an extra public holiday. Prime Minister Keir Starmer had previously expressed support for such a celebration.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has alleged that he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies, many showing signs of sexual assault and violence, between 1995 and 2014. The man claims temple supervisors covered up the deaths and threatened him into silence. His confession has prompted the Karnataka government to form a Special Investigation Team to probe the decades-old allegations of murder and sexual assault. The case has also led families of missing persons to demand their cases be reopened.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the world-famous Shaolin Temple, is under criminal investigation in China for multiple allegations, including embezzlement and improper relationships with women. Known as the "CEO monk" for commercializing the 1,500-year-old institution, he has been stripped of his ordination certificate by China's Buddhist association. This is not the first time Shi has faced such accusations, having been cleared of similar charges in 2015. The investigation into the high-profile religious leader has become a major topic of discussion on Chinese social media.</p>

The EU managed to secure this rate for key exports like cars and has avoided a full-blown trade war, which provides some economic stability amid sluggish growth in Europe.

          <p>Russell Vought, a key author of the Project 2025 conservative blueprint and White House budget director, stated he was unfamiliar with the project's chapter on overhauling the Federal Reserve. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Vought suggested President Trump's recent criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the specific proposals in Project 2025. Despite Trump's insistence he has "nothing to do" with the plan, his administration's policies often align with its recommendations, including increased pressure on the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>A legislative push to force a vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein is causing a rift within the Republican party. House Speaker Mike Johnson has labeled the measure "reckless," claiming it lacks sufficient protections for victims, an argument the bill's co-sponsors, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, reject as a "straw man." Massie warned that blocking the vote could become a political liability for the GOP, suggesting it could alienate voters who want transparency. The division highlights the ongoing political fallout and conspiracy theories surrounding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Tyler Boebert, the 20-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, has been cited for misdemeanor child abuse related to an incident involving his own young son. The citation for "criminal negligence" reportedly stems from a "miscommunication on monitoring" that led to the congresswoman's grandson getting out of the house. This is not Tyler's first encounter with law enforcement, as he pleaded guilty to a felony charge earlier in the year related to property thefts. Rep. Boebert stated that her son has been working to get his life on track as a father.</p>

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has formally rebuffed diplomatic outreach from South Korea's new liberal government. In a statement, she asserted that Seoul's "blind trust" in its alliance with the U.S. and its underlying hostility toward the North make dialogue pointless. This marks North Korea's first official response to President Lee Jae Myung's administration, signaling that Pyongyang sees no immediate need to resume diplomacy. The rejection comes as North Korea continues to strengthen its ties with Russia and shun talks with the U.S. and South Korea.</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union, which sets a 15% tariff on many European goods, has been met with mixed reactions across Europe. While leaders from Italy and Ireland cautiously welcomed the deal for providing stability and averting a worse outcome, the powerful Federation of German Industries (BDI) called it an "inadequate compromise." The BDI criticized the acceptance of "painful tariffs" and the lack of a deal on steel and aluminum. The agreement averts the 30% tariffs threatened by the U.S. but represents a significant compromise for the EU.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential and sharply witty musical satirist, has died at the age of 97. Rising to fame in the 1950s and 60s, Lehrer was known for his piano-driven songs that cleverly skewered politics, the nuclear age, and societal norms, before he largely retired from public performance to teach mathematics. His work, including songs written for the show "That Was The Week That Was," established a genre of comedy songwriting that inspired generations of satirists.
