            <p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raised $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2025, marking her strongest fundraising quarter to date. This surge in donations coincides with her "Fighting Oligarchy" tour alongside Senator Bernie Sanders, where they criticize President Trump's policies and the influence of billionaires like Elon Musk. The rallies have drawn significant crowds, even in traditionally Republican states. AOC is also being considered as a potential primary challenger to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in 2028, highlighting the progressive wing's desire for new leadership within the Democratic Party.</p>

            <p>Approximately 20,000 IRS employees have shown interest in accepting the Trump administration's deferred resignation offer, potentially reducing the agency's workforce by roughly 20%. This exodus comes as the deadline for Americans to file their income tax returns approaches. The IRS, which had expanded to over 102,000 employees in 2024, faces potential cuts of up to 40% through reduction-in-force efforts. While the Treasury Department claims employee departures under Trump are similar to additions under Biden, the significant potential workforce reduction raises concerns about the agency's ability to function effectively.</p>

            <p>President Trump has expressed interest in sending US citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons, particularly El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. Legal experts, however, assert that such a move would be unconstitutional, citing multiple constitutional provisions that protect citizens from deportation. The administration has struggled to provide legal justification for the proposal, raising concerns about potential violations of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The legal battle surrounding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongfully deported to El Salvador, further complicates the issue.</p>

United plans to reduce domestic flight capacity by 4% due to weaker demand, while international bookings remain strong.

The aim is to address the gap left by US tariffs and to accredit more Brazilian slaughterhouses for export to China, following recent rejections due to technical and sanitary concerns.

            <p>With the tax deadline approaching, many Americans may be scrambling to file their returns. A tax extension offers a six-month reprieve, allowing individuals more time to gather necessary documents and navigate complex tax situations. While an extension grants extra time to file, it does not extend the payment deadline. The IRS provides various methods for filing an extension, including online payment systems and Form 4868. Failure to file or pay on time can result in penalties, although the IRS may waive them for reasonable cause.</p>

            <p>A proposed California law, named Wyland's Law, seeks to strengthen and expedite the process by which courts report restraining orders to the state. This legislation arises after a 10-year-old boy was killed by his father, who was able to purchase a firearm despite being under a domestic violence restraining order. The bill would require county courts to maintain verifiable records of submitted orders and ensure those records are accessible within one day. The goal is to prevent individuals subject to restraining orders from acquiring guns due to bureaucratic delays.</p>

Trump's blend of Bukele's violence with Orbán's subtle manipulation could ultimately inflame resistance to his policies.

            <p>The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee is requesting an investigation into DOGE's access to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), raising concerns about potential "technological malfeasance." Representative Gerry Connolly's letter highlights whistleblower disclosures indicating that DOGE engineers attempted to exfiltrate and alter data, including sensitive information about union activities and corporate secrets. The concerns are amplified by the fact that Elon Musk's companies have cases pending before the NLRB, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will allocate $3 million to help homeowners near the Eaton burn area test for lead contamination. Preliminary tests revealed elevated lead levels in soil samples collected downwind of the burn scar. The county is stepping in because the federal government has opted to break from a nearly two-decade tradition of testing soil on destroyed properties cleaned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after fires. Lead contamination poses serious health risks, and the county's action aims to protect residents from exposure.</p>

The levies on goods from China, where many third-party sellers source their products, could be particularly burdensome. Some sellers plan to maintain prices to remain competitive, but the added costs could ultimately force them out of business. (not investment advice)</p>

The case involves the "unitary executive" theory, which argues that presidents should have legal control over all federal jobs not part of Congress or the judiciary. A ruling in favor of the unitary executive theory could allow Trump to fire officials who are supposed to be independent from political pressure, potentially impacting agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>

            <p>Hamas has rejected a new Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza that included the release of more Israeli hostages and negotiations on the disarmament of Palestinian militant groups. Israel's offer involved releasing 10 living hostages within one week in exchange for nearly 1,400 Palestinian detainees and prisoners. Hamas said any agreement must ensure a permanent end to the war, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the reconstruction of the territory. The rejection highlights the ongoing challenges in reaching a lasting resolution to the conflict.</p>

            <p>President Trump threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating a conflict between his administration and the institution. This action follows the administration's decision to freeze over $2.2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard rejected demands to reform campus practices. Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to curb what he views as a far-left bias in academia, while critics argue that the administration's actions are an unlawful attempt to stifle academic freedom. The potential loss of tax-exempt status raises significant concerns for colleges and universities.</p>

            <p>A senior Army official ordered Army libraries, including West Point, to remove all books "with the explicit and sole purpose of directly and overtly promoting DEI, gender ideology, and critical race theory in a manner that subverts meritocracy and unity," according to a memo sent last week by acting Assistant Secretary of the Army Derrick Anderson. Since the memo was sent by Assistant Secretary Anderson, however, all Army libraries were told this week to only "flag" rather than remove any books, said a U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly, adding that a final decision for removing books will be made by top Army officials.</p>
