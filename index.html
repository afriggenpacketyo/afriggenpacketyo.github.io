          <p>Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed on a framework to move forward with trade talks after disputes over visas, minerals, and microchips threatened to derail progress. This agreement followed two days of talks in London and a phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping aimed at easing tensions. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that both sides will seek approval from their respective leaders to implement the framework, which builds upon a previous 90-day suspension of tariffs agreed to in Geneva. The disputes had eroded nearly a third of the 90-day window for resolving trade issues, including unfair trade practices and export controls, before tariffs were set to resume.

          <p>The U.S. Army is deploying SMASH 2000L smart scopes, made by Israeli company Smart Shooter Ltd., which use cameras, sensors, and AI to track and engage drones, ensuring a high probability of a hit before firing. This technology allows individual soldiers to effectively counter drone threats without needing extensive support. The Army awarded Smart Shooter a $13 million contract for these scopes under the Transformation In Contact (TIC 2.0) program, aimed at rapidly equipping soldiers with useful technology. The scopes, weighing about 2.5 pounds, are compatible with standard-issue rifles and have been tested in combat zones and used by NATO partners. The deployment comes as small, inexpensive drones are increasingly used for reconnaissance and attacks in modern warfare. The optimism score is calculated based on the fact that there is a new form of military defense that does not involve human-to-human contact, thus reducing the risk of human casualties.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown L.A. from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests, citing concerns about vandalism and looting. The curfew encompasses a one-square-mile area bounded by the 5, 110, and 10 Freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and the homeless. Protests, triggered by recent immigration raids, have resulted in nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses. President Trump has deployed National Guard troops and Marines to protect federal property, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as illegal and inflammatory. The curfew and military deployment reflect escalating tensions and differing perspectives on managing the protests.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Trump of intentionally escalating the Los Angeles protests through the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines. Newsom argued that Trump's actions endangered peaceful protesters and targeted immigrant families, asserting that state and local law enforcement had the situation under control before federal intervention. He also criticized Trump's administration for using tear gas, flash-bang grenades, and rubber bullets on protesters. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta sought a restraining order against the Department of Defense's actions and filed a lawsuit alleging the deployment violated the U.S. Constitution. The governorâ€™s remarks underscore the growing political and legal conflict surrounding the protests and federal response.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the restoration of several Army base names that originally honored Confederate military figures, reversing a renaming process initiated by Congress and completed under President Biden. However, the bases will now be named after other service members who share similar names, rather than Confederates. For example, Fort Gordon will now honor Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon instead of Confederate John Brown Gordon. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll will implement the renamings. This decision unwinds the work of the Naming Commission, which sought to remove Confederate symbols, reflecting Trump's continued stance on preserving historical names despite their controversial associations.</p>

Kirchner, who served as president from 2007 to 2015 and as vice president from 2019 to 2023, has denounced the ruling as politically motivated. Due to her age, Kirchner is likely to serve her sentence under house arrest. President Milei applauded the verdict, writing, "Justice. Period."</p>

The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause the ruling pending appeal, scheduling oral arguments for July 31. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal, including those on U.S. trading partners and on Canada, Mexico, and China. The legal battle over the tariffs continues, with the Trump administration arguing they are necessary to address trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UN panel has urged the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, stating that the current agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius but allowed the UK to maintain a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel argues that preventing Chagossians from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to return and exercise their cultural rights. The panel calls for the suspension of the current deal and negotiation of a new agreement that ensures the rights of the Chagossian people. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the UK-Mauritius deal had been "welcomed by international organisations including the UN secretary general".</p>
