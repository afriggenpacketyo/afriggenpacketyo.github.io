          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that doing nothing to reform social care for older and disabled adults is an "active" and "untenable" decision. The article explains that the failure to fix England's social care system is costing the country financially and in human terms. The report states that an extra £1 billion spent on social care would create 50,000 jobs and generate a £1.75 return to the wider economy. The article also highlights the need for better data collection and assessment of unmet care needs.</p>
