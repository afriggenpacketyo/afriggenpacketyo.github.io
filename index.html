          <p>Actor Rob Lowe recently shared the career advice he offered his son, John Owen Lowe, who decided to pursue acting after graduating from Stanford. Lowe advised him to become a content creator, a path his son has successfully followed by selling a new show to Apple TV+. Lowe emphasized that in today's environment, there are ample opportunities for aspiring artists to create their own material, a significant change from when he started his career. He also spoke about his pride in both of his sons and his 35 years of sobriety.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that his military has received a U.S.-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, which has been operational for a month. This development is notable given Israel's previously cautious stance on providing military aid to Ukraine and its complex relationship with Russia. The article also notes other international developments, including the International Paralympic Committee's controversial decision to lift all sanctions against Russia and Belarus, a move strongly condemned by Ukraine's Sports Minister as a betrayal of Olympic values.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to handle what he described as "domestic terrorists" and protect federal facilities. The move is part of an expansion of controversial deployments to American cities, following similar actions in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Trump stated he was directing the Department of Defense to provide all necessary force to protect an ICE facility he claimed was under siege by Antifa. The city's mayor, Keith Wilson, has stated that federal intervention is neither requested nor needed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the enduring power of young adult novels, using the 50th anniversary of Judy Blume's groundbreaking book "Forever" as a touchstone. It highlights how such books provide a crucial space for teenagers to see their own anxieties and desires reflected, validating feelings that are often difficult to articulate. By depicting topics like sexuality from a female perspective, these novels served as a rite of passage for many, offering a chance to imagine future possibilities and feel understood. The article celebrates the unique and formative role that art discovered during adolescence can play in a person's life.</p>

          <p>Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has ordered hundreds of generals and admirals from around the world to an unusual and abrupt meeting, causing unease and speculation within the U.S. military. The gathering is officially intended for Hegseth to deliver a "rally the troops" message focused on the "warrior ethos," but it has fueled anxiety about potential firings or demotions. This comes after Hegseth has already dismissed over a dozen senior officials and ordered significant cuts to the number of high-ranking officers, contributing to a climate of uncertainty and concern about the administration's intentions for the military's leadership.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who became the first Black woman hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92.

When asked about an attack on an ICE facility, Trump claimed his political opponents were causing the problem and warned that "bad things happen when they play these games." Critics condemned the remarks as a thinly veiled threat, suggesting that Trump was inviting violence from his supporters and dangerously escalating political tensions in the country.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Criticizes Trump's Comments on Tylenol Use During Pregnancy as Misogynistic</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's recent advice for pregnant women to "tough it out" and avoid Tylenol is irresponsible and deeply misogynistic. The author contends that Trump's unsubstantiated link between acetaminophen and autism ignores scientific consensus and reinforces a long history of dismissing or misunderstanding women's pain. The piece frames the president's comments not as a genuine health concern, but as another form of mom-shaming and an attempt to control women's bodies. The author concludes that this "war on Tylenol" is ultimately a war on women.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning about foreign attempts to illegally smuggle key strategic minerals, such as antimony, out of the country. The ministry stated that some foreign nations are trying to bypass China's export controls to build up their own reserves of these scarce resources, posing a threat to national security. The warning was accompanied by the disclosure of two recent antimony smuggling cases, one involving a family-run criminal network, highlighting the ongoing efforts to combat the illicit trade of critical materials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to widespread user fatigue with swiping culture, major dating apps like Bumble and those owned by Match Group and Meta are integrating AI to act as a more sophisticated matchmaker. These new systems aim to pair users based on deeper values and goals rather than superficial profile details, with some even using AI chatbots to facilitate initial interactions. However, skepticism remains, as past attempts at algorithmic matchmaking have shown limited success. The fundamental unpredictability of human chemistry presents a significant challenge that even advanced AI may not be able to solve.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the Labour Party back to power with a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing significant internal pressure and poor polling numbers ahead of the party's annual conference. An analysis based on conversations with numerous ministers and MPs reveals widespread frustration with his leadership style, which is described as indecisive and lacking a clear, communicated vision. While some allies defend his steady leadership on the world stage, many in the party feel he has failed to articulate a compelling story for the government's agenda, fueling speculation about his long-term suitability for the job.</p>
