          <p>Since Donald Trump's return to office, the United States' soft power, traditionally a key asset in international relations, has been eroding, according to this article. Actions such as attacks on academic freedom, cuts to research funding, and authoritarian tendencies are diminishing America's attractiveness and global influence. These policies are leading to a potential brain drain and tarnishing the US image as a beacon of democracy. This shift is remarkably benefiting China, which is poised to capitalize on the US's weakened standing.</p>

Despite declining religious affiliation, college students are increasingly participating in religious-life programs, and many institutions are expanding their chaplaincy services. Modern chaplains are taking on diverse responsibilities, including counseling students on various issues, navigating housing insecurity, and supporting campus protests. They are also embracing alternative forms of spirituality and self-care to meet the changing needs of their students, offering guidance and a sense of belonging.</p>

The author argues that Rose's on-field achievements, including being the all-time Hit King, should outweigh his past transgressions, namely betting on baseball games. The article emphasizes that the Hall of Fame should honor Rose's greatness, not his character, and that his actions did not affect game outcomes. The Classic Baseball committee will meet in December 2027 to determine Rose's fate. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump is advancing plans to construct a new section of border wall in a remote region of Arizona, threatening a crucial wildlife corridor. The area, south of Tucson, is one of the most biodiverse in the US, serving as a migration route for various animals between Mexico and Arizona. Conservationists warn that the wall will sever this critical connection, impacting species such as bears, mountain lions, and wolves. The new push for the wall comes despite falling rates of unauthorized crossings and criticism that it is an expensive, unnecessary, and environmentally disastrous project.</p>

          <p>A new study from the CDC indicates a significant decrease in RSV hospitalizations among babies due to the widespread availability of a vaccine for pregnant women and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Compared to pre-pandemic seasons, RSV hospitalizations in babies under seven months dropped by as much as 56%, and in newborns, by as much as 71%. This trend suggests that these preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young infants from severe RSV illness. Older children, however, did not experience the same benefit.</p>

          <p>This article warns small businesses that the current pause in Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods is likely temporary and that they should prepare for future trade disruptions. Despite the pause, existing tariffs remain in place, effectively raising the tariff rate on Chinese goods to around 40%. The author advises businesses to use the suspension to stock up on products, seek alternative suppliers, or bring manufacturing back to the US. The article stresses that Trump's history suggests a resumption of the trade war is likely, urging businesses to plan accordingly.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is hosting a private dinner for the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP meme coin. However, analysis of the coin's ownership reveals that many of the top wallets are linked to international exchanges and are likely owned by individuals outside the U.S. This raises questions about the identities and motivations of those who have gained access to the President through their cryptocurrency holdings. Justin Sun, who invested heavily in the Trump family's World Liberty Financial token, is believed to be among the top $TRUMP holders.</p>
