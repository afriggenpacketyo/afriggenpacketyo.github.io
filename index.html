          <p>Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska is cautioning the Trump administration against a proposal to import beef from Argentina, arguing it would harm American cattle ranchers. While the administration suggests the move could lower grocery store prices for consumers, Fischer contends it would undermine the U.S. agricultural economy, which is already struggling. The plan is part of a broader U.S. financial assistance package for Argentina, but it has drawn criticism from both lawmakers and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association for potentially destabilizing the domestic market.</p>

          <p>A coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs has launched the "Take Back Tesla" campaign, urging shareholders to vote against a new, nearly $1 trillion pay proposal for CEO Elon Musk. The group argues the package is excessive and fails to require Musk to focus on Tesla over his other business and political activities, which they claim have damaged the company's brand. This pushback comes as proxy advisory firms also recommend against the plan, citing governance concerns similar to those that led a Delaware court to void his previous $56 billion package.</p>

          <p>An analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, particularly for imported goods like furniture, electronics, and auto parts. The research found that businesses are passing a significant portion of these tariff costs—estimated at around 35%—directly to consumers through higher prices. While the White House defends the trade policy as beneficial for long-term job growth, studies suggest the levies will cost U.S. businesses over a trillion dollars this year.

          <p>Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is contingent on passing a "means test," which assesses whether an individual's income is low enough to qualify for debt liquidation. The test compares a person's average monthly income over the last six months to the median income for a household of their size in their state. If income is above the median, it does not mean automatic disqualification; filers can still qualify if their disposable income is minimal after subtracting legally allowed expenses like housing, taxes, and healthcare.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that neglect at a Manchester mental health unit likely contributed to the death of 22-year-old Cerys Lupton-Jones. An inquest found that staff falsified observation records, stating she was safe when she was not, and failed to increase checks after an earlier suicide attempt. The coroner described the care as a "shambles" and noted a culture of falsifying records on the ward, highlighting a gross failure to provide basic medical attention to a person in a dependent position.</p>
