          <p>Attorney General Bondi criticized judges Hannah Dugan and Joel Cano for allegedly assisting undocumented immigrants, some of whom were violent criminals. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested for allegedly obstructing an immigration arrest, while former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano was accused of tampering with evidence related to an alleged gang member. Bondi dismissed accusations that the Trump administration was intimidating judges and emphasized that no one is above the law. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers criticized President Trump for undermining the judiciary, while Mayor Cavalier Johnson accused federal agents of 'showboating'.</p>

JoJo Siwa also garnered attention when she publicly identified as queer instead of lesbian during her time on the show, stating that she was 'switching letters'. The series followed the lives of thirteen celebrities as they lived together in a house, cut off from the outside world.</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers have increased prices on hundreds of goods in response to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with average price hikes around 30%. Items like tech accessories and women's clothing have seen increases, and other e-commerce sites like Shein and Temu have also raised prices. While Trump indicated potential tariff reductions, Chinese officials denied active negotiations. The price hikes illustrate the difficulties retailers face in navigating the tariff agenda and uncertainty surrounding trade relations between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Legal scholars and former OpenAI employees are challenging OpenAI's potential restructuring into a for-profit entity, arguing it would be illegal and detrimental to the company's mission of ensuring AI benefits all of humanity. They contend that the nonprofit's control over OpenAI's governance is invaluable and should not be sold, even for a substantial sum. The scholars argue that the nonprofit board would be breaching their duties if they proceeded with the sale, and they are urging attorneys general to intervene. The debate centers on whether OpenAI's mission can be effectively pursued by a fully commercial company.</p>

          <p>The FBI arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of interfering with immigration agents. Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest in her courtroom. This incident highlights the tension between federal immigration enforcement and local courts, with some municipalities limiting cooperation with federal deportation efforts.

The memo directs secretaries to dismiss unsubstantiated complaints and consider favorable actions for the alleged offender until the complaint is substantiated. Hegseth himself has faced allegations of sexual misconduct and sharing military information on unencrypted messaging apps, leading to scrutiny of his leadership at the Pentagon.</p>

The author also touches on the increasing popularity of female-made erotic content and concludes by suggesting that stories that assert people's humanity can serve as an antidote to a porn-addled culture.</p>
