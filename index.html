          <p>Joby Aviation and Virgin Atlantic are partnering to launch an electric air taxi service in the U.K., offering a potential solution to airport gridlock and a glimpse into the future of sustainable transportation.  The service will use Joby's five-seat electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, capable of speeds up to 200 mph and 100 emissions-free miles per charge. Virgin Atlantic's role will involve marketing, regulatory support, and infrastructure development. The article, from Fox News, may present a somewhat overly optimistic view of the technology's rapid adoption, potentially downplaying potential challenges.</p>
