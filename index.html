          <p>The FBI issued a warning about cybercriminals actively exploiting outdated routers that no longer receive security patches, especially devices manufactured around 2010 or earlier. These routers are being hijacked by malware, such as "TheMoon," and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations, with the compromised routers quietly conscripted into proxy networks. The FBI bulletin names specific router models as frequent targets, emphasizing that these devices have known security vulnerabilities that were never patched. The article recommends replacing old routers, keeping firmware updated, disabling remote access, using strong passwords, monitoring for strange behavior, and reporting incidents to authorities.</p>

The plan involves releasing 300,000 tons of rice, bypassing the traditional auction system, and includes considerations for online sales to broaden distribution.

          <p>President Trump's recent call for a swift end to the war in Gaza reflects a growing impatience among Israel's allies, including the United States, Britain, and France. These countries, which had initially supported Israel's response to the Hamas-led attack, have become more critical of Israel's actions, with Britain suspending trade negotiations and France organizing a conference to discuss a Palestinian state. Despite this shift in tone, these countries continue to provide practical support to Israel, indicating a complex and evolving relationship.</p>
