          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has publicly advised the Trump administration to impeach "corrupt judges," a call amplified by prominent MAGA figures. This intervention occurs amidst a rise in threats against U.S. judges, with experts noting parallels between the administration's rhetoric and tactics used by authoritarian leaders globally to weaken judicial independence. The article details how these verbal attacks contribute to a climate of intimidation, potentially influencing judicial decisions and undermining the democratic principle of separation of powers. This trend is seen as a deliberate strategy to weaken institutional checks on executive authority.</p>

          <p>An initiative in Florida, led by a Ron DeSantis appointee, is auditing Democratic-run cities for alleged wasteful spending, drawing criticism for its methods and political motivations. The article highlights an incident where armed investigators visited the home of a military veteran who sent a non-threatening postcard to the official, raising concerns about intimidation. Additionally, targeted counties like Broward are pushing back against the audits, claiming the state's calculations of waste are based on inaccurate data. Critics suggest the campaign is a political maneuver to undermine local governments and advance the governor's agenda.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert evaluates the security differences between using a wired Ethernet connection and Wi-Fi for home internet access. While Ethernet is inherently more secure due to its physical nature, the article concludes that a well-configured Wi-Fi network with strong passwords, WPA3 encryption, and an updated router can be nearly as safe. The piece emphasizes that overall network hygiene, such as using antivirus software and a VPN for sensitive tasks, is more critical than the connection method alone. It provides several actionable steps for users to enhance their home network security regardless of how they connect.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has announced that its forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along their shared border. The clashes represent a significant escalation in tensions, which Afghanistan claims were in retaliation for recent Pakistani airstrikes on its territory. Pakistan has not confirmed the casualties and accuses Afghanistan of harboring militants from the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul denies. Major border crossings like Torkham have been closed, and regional powers are calling for de-escalation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, declaring an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports to begin next month. This new levy will be placed on top of existing tariffs, bringing the total to 130%. The move is a direct response to China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for many U.S. industries, including defense and technology. The announcement caused major U.S. stock indexes to fall sharply, and the president has indicated that a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping may no longer be necessary.</p>

In contrast, younger consumers are more influenced by social media trends and often use "bracketing"—ordering multiple sizes online and returning most—a practice that online retailers are making more restrictive. High-end stores like Bloomingdale's are leaning into this by focusing on luxury brands and personalized service to appeal to wealthier, often older, clientele.</p>

Kay was previously convicted and sentenced to 22 years in prison for providing the fentanyl-laced pills that led to Skaggs' death.

Democrats insist on extending the subsidies before the November 1 open enrollment period, while Republicans argue there is more time since they don't expire until December. The article notes that public support for extending the credits is overwhelmingly high across party lines, with polls showing over 75% in favor. Insurance commissioners warn that failing to act quickly could cause consumers to see massive premium hikes when they shop for plans, potentially leading millions to become uninsured even if the credits are extended later.</p>

          <p>Officials in the Trump administration are exploring the possibility of selling parts of the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to private financial firms. This move aligns with a broader goal of reducing the government's role in student lending but raises significant concerns among borrower advocates. Experts warn that transferring the debt to private entities could strip away important borrower protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and the potential for loan forgiveness, which private companies would have little incentive to offer. The plan is viewed by critics as a way to benefit Wall Street at the expense of millions of borrowers.</p>

          <p>Dozens of American doctors and nurses who have volunteered in Gaza describe the profound personal and professional impact of working in the war-torn region. They recount operating under constant threat, with scarce resources, and witnessing an overwhelming number of child casualties with horrific injuries. Many volunteers, including some who were previously supporters of Israel, have been transformed into activists, speaking out against what they saw and urging for an end to the violence. The article provides harrowing firsthand accounts of the humanitarian crisis, the collapse of the healthcare system, and the deep psychological toll on those who have borne witness.</p>

          <p>Newly elected Arizona congresswoman Adelita Grijalva is being prevented from taking office by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who claims he cannot administer the oath during a pro forma session. However, critics point out that two Republicans were sworn in under identical circumstances earlier this year. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver to prevent Grijalva from casting the deciding vote on a discharge petition that would force the release of unclassified government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The petition is just one signature short of the 218 needed to compel a House vote, a move opposed by President Trump.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case, Chiles vs. Salazar, challenging a Colorado law that bans licensed therapists from practicing conversion therapy on minors. The plaintiff, a Christian counselor represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, argues the ban is a violation of free speech by discriminating against her viewpoint. Proponents of the ban, including parents whose children were harmed by the practice, contend that the therapy is a form of harmful conduct that states have a right to regulate. The article explores the emotional testimony of parents and the complex legal balance between 1st Amendment rights and the state's interest in protecting children's welfare.</p>

          <p>The head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, has warned that "uncertainty is the new normal" for the global economy, a sentiment underscored by President Trump's recent threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. While the global economy has been more resilient than expected, this article argues that risks are mounting. The ongoing trade disputes, coupled with a potentially overvalued AI market bubble, create significant threats of a "sharp correction." The analysis suggests that as finance ministers gather for their annual meetings, they face a complex landscape where geopolitical shocks and market volatility could severely test global economic stability.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire agreement, preparations are underway to significantly increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, with a target of around 600 trucks per day. The United Nations has vast quantities of food and medicine ready for delivery once Israeli inspections are complete. For residents, the ceasefire allows many to return to their neighborhoods, though they often find only rubble where their homes once stood. The deal also includes the release of Israeli hostages and some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with preparations for their reception ongoing in both Israel and Gaza.</p>

          <p>The prospect of an escalating trade war with the United States is casting a shadow over the Chinese stock market, which has seen a significant rally in 2025. President Trump's threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods caused a gauge of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks to plunge over 6%. This year, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index had climbed 31%, buoyed by a previous trade truce and optimism about China's AI sector. Analysts now warn that the renewed tensions and potential for new tech restrictions will likely put immediate pressure on Chinese markets when they open. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the former frontman of the band Lostprophets, has died in prison after being attacked. West Yorkshire Police have arrested two men on suspicion of murder. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for numerous child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby, crimes a judge described as plunging to "new depths of depravity." The 48-year-old had been jailed in 2013, leading to the immediate disbandment of his successful rock band. A recent report on the prison had noted a marked increase in violence and that many inmates felt unsafe.</p>

This same unit was instrumental in the 2009 crisis that initially brought Rajoelina to power.

          <p>The EU Commission has proposed doubling its tariffs on steel imports to 50% for volumes exceeding a newly reduced quota, a move mirroring recent U.S. trade policy. The measure is intended to protect the struggling European steel industry from global overcapacity, largely blamed on China, and has been described as a "lifeline" by the European Steel Association. While China has labeled the move as protectionism, some analysts see it as a strategic effort by Brussels to gain leverage with the Trump administration. The EU may be seeking concessions, such as an exemption from U.S. tariffs, by demonstrating its willingness to adopt similarly robust measures.</p>

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track the entry and exit of non-EU citizens in the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces manual passport stamping, will require travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, on their first use. This registration will be valid for three years. While the goal is to enhance security and streamline travel, there are concerns about potential delays during the initial rollout at key transit points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>
