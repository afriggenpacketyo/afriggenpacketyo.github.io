          <h2>Economists Challenge Accuracy of Trump's Tariff Calculation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 13:23:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are questioning the formula used by the Trump administration to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it's based on flawed assumptions and inflates the actual rates. The formula, which divides a country's trade deficit with the U.S. by its exports and then divides by two, assumes a lower elasticity rate than what economists believe is accurate. According to experts, adjusting the elasticity rate would result in significantly lower tariff rates for most countries, bringing them closer to the baseline 10% established by the administration. These concerns raise questions about the justification and impact of Trump's sweeping tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is standing firm on his tariff program, urging Americans to "hang tough" despite recent stock market declines. He claims the plan is already bringing trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy and creating jobs. However, the tariffs have sparked concerns about a global trade war and potential recession, with China retaliating with tariffs on U.S. imports. Some legal groups are challenging the tariffs, calling them an unlawful attempt to make Americans pay higher taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are requesting a sentence of over seven years for former U.S. Representative George Santos, citing his "brazen web of deceit" that defrauded donors, misled voters, and fueled his political rise through fraudulent activities.
