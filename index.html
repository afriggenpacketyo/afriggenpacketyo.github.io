        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly planning to engage in discussions with Brentford regarding a potential acquisition of striker Bryan Mbeumo to reinforce their offensive capabilities, as the team scored the fifth lowest amount of goals in the Premier League last season. Head coach Ruben Amorim is prioritizing the addition of striking firepower, viewing Mbeumo as a versatile and dynamic player capable of bolstering the team's attack, especially given the limited output from recent signings. Mbeumo, a Cameroon international, is said to favor a move to United, having scored 20 league goals for Brentford in the previous season, though his contract with Brentford has one year remaining, with an option for another year, and does not include a release clause. The pursuit of Mbeumo is expected to proceed independently of speculation surrounding Bruno Fernandes' potential transfer to a Saudi Pro-League club.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Boulder, Colorado, have updated the number of injured to 12 following an attack on demonstrators rallying for Israeli hostages in Gaza; the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, faces multiple felony charges, including a federal hate crime charge, and the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. Soliman allegedly threw Molotov cocktails at the crowd, resulting in burns and other injuries, while shouting "Free Palestine!" and reportedly expressing a desire to kill all Zionist people, having planned the attack for a year. The suspect, an Egyptian national who arrived in the U.S. in 2022, had allegedly researched how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube after being unable to purchase a firearm, and had 16 unused Molotov cocktails at the scene of the attack. The attack occurred during a weekly event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group advocating for the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas, and has been condemned as antisemitic by organizers and officials, including Colorado Governor Jared Polis.</p>

          <p>Geert Wilders, a far-right leader in the Netherlands, has pulled his party from the Dutch governing coalition, citing a lack of progress in implementing stricter immigration policies. Wilders expressed frustration that the four-party coalition had not moved swiftly enough to enact his proposed measures to curb immigration. This decision has led to the collapse of the coalition government, creating political instability in the country. The move comes just weeks before the Netherlands is scheduled to host world leaders for a NATO summit.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has issued a warning that global economic growth is expected to slow down this year, largely due to the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump's administration in the United States. The OECD now projects worldwide growth to be 2.9%, a decrease from the previous forecast of 3.1%, attributing the downgrade to a significant rise in trade barriers. The organization cautioned that the weakened economic outlook will have widespread repercussions, affecting nearly all countries, as Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing tariffs has created uncertainty in the global market. This is a direct governmental regulation on finance, and is strictly about the economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jonathan Joss, the actor known for voicing John Redcorn on 'King of the Hill' and playing Chief Ken Hotate in 'Parks and Recreation,' has died in Texas. His husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, alleges that the shooting was a homophobic hate crime, though police have stated they have found no evidence to support this claim. Gonzales said that a man began yelling homophobic slurs before opening fire after the couple discovered the skull of one of their dogs at the site of their former home, which had been destroyed in a fire. Gonzales said that Joss pushed him out of the way, saving his life.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is in doubt after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest Â£4bn into the UK's largest water company, increasing the possibility of government-supervised administration. Thames Water, serving about a quarter of the UK's population, called the news disappointing but said it would work on an alternative plan, which is considered the last chance to save the company from administration. Sources close to the situation told the BBC that the politicisation of the water industry was a major disincentive for investors to put money into the sector. An independent review of the water industry has said the current regulatory system is chaotic and needs to change, requiring long-term investors.</p>

          <p>Regional authorities in Bavaria, Germany, have reported that two people from Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm were recently infected with the rare Bornavirus, resulting in one death. The local health department is investigating the potential mode of infection, as the virus is spread by the bicolored shrew through contact with its excrement, urine, or saliva. While the virus is present in bicolored shrews across many parts of Bavaria, up to seven cases of infection have been reported in Germany since March 2020, when registration became mandatory, with a total of 55 infections registered nationwide. The virus was identified as causing severe brain inflammation in humans in 2018.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has found that it is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted shaken public trust due to pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The review calls for clearer government direction, improved long-term investment approaches, and stronger local community involvement, as well as new legislation. The government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, and Environment Secretary Steve Reed has described the water system as broken, promising a full response to the commission's findings.</p>

As buzzards are a protected species, intervention options are limited, but the school is using the situation as a learning opportunity, with pupils creating art and writing stories about the bird.

The researchers recommend that the German government pursue a plan for the expansion and integration of European defense structures while continuing to work with NATO as long as possible.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, on trial for the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of another, testified that she has long enjoyed mushrooms but developed a preference for wild varieties due to their enhanced flavor. Patterson pleaded not guilty after serving a meal containing death cap mushrooms to her relatives in Victoria in July 2023. Prosecutors allege she deliberately included the poisonous mushrooms in the meal, while her defense claims it was a terrible accident. Patterson stated she began foraging for wild mushrooms during the Covid pandemic, years before the incident, and primarily picked field mushrooms, sometimes with her children.</p>

The Japanese government believes the incident was caused by a grudge over business and was not politically motivated or triggered by anti-Japan sentiment. The Japanese Embassy in Beijing has offered support to the victims' families, and Dalian authorities have confirmed the bodies were cremated and the family members have returned to Japan.</p>

The OECD also projects a further slowdown to 1.5% in 2026, noting that Trump's policies have raised average U.S. tariff rates to 15.4%, the highest since 1938.

The president said that so far "nobodyâ€™s asked" for any such pardon for Diddy: "I know people are thinking about it. I know that they're thinking about it.

Overtourism is defined as the point at which locals or visitors feel tourism has negatively impacted the quality of life in a region to an unacceptable degree. It exacerbates existing problems of heavy tourism, stretching infrastructure and local resources to their limit, and leading to noise, littering, and altered landscapes. Emissions from tourism increased significantly between 1995 and 2019, contributing to climate change, and some cities and regions are trying to limit the number of travelers at certain times or altogether.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two key mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, including ordering Max Verstappen to give back a position to George Russell after an incident in Turn One, a decision based on concerns about a potential penalty. The stewards later ruled that Russell had momentarily lost control of his car and collided with Verstappen, who did not deliberately leave the track, resulting in no further action. The second error was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a decision Verstappen questioned, with Horner admitting they should have left him out on his soft tires. This incident highlights the complexities of racing regulations and the split-second decisions teams must make.</p>
