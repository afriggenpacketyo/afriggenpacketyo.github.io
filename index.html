          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall have devastated parts of South Korea, leading to at least 14 fatalities and leaving 12 people missing. The severe weather caused landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, particularly in southern regions like Sancheong. In response to the disaster, authorities have evacuated approximately 3,840 people from their homes. While the rain has now subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted, recovery and search efforts are ongoing for those still unaccounted for across the affected areas.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of reducing sewage discharges from water companies by half by the year 2030. This announcement follows public outrage and new data showing a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024 to a record high. The plan also aims to ban wet wipes containing plastic and cut phosphorus pollution, addressing widespread criticism of water companies for environmental damage. The pledge comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, with consumer bills expected to rise to fund infrastructure improvements.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, despite her bizarre defense. Gwozdz claimed the shooting was an accident that occurred while she and her husband were playfully reenacting an Elmer Fudd cartoon, leading her to believe the gun was unloaded. After an initial mistrial, a second jury found her guilty, rejecting the story that she accidentally shot her husband twice in the head. The prosecution argued it was a deliberate execution, and she was ultimately sentenced to 40 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Players in the WNBA All-Star Game made a unified statement regarding their ongoing labor dispute by wearing warmup shirts that read, "Pay us what you owe us." The protest comes after the players and the league failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in a recent meeting. The WNBA Players Association opted out of the previous CBA in search of a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. With negotiations stalled, some prominent players have raised the possibility of a walkout if a new deal is not reached.</p>
