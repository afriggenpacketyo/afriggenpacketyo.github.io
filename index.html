          <p>The United States men's national team overcame an early deficit to defeat Australia 2-1 in a friendly match in Colorado. Striker Haji Wright scored two first-half goals to secure the win after Australia's Jordy Bos opened the scoring. The victory was tempered by an early injury to captain Christian Pulisic, who was substituted in the 27th minute following several heavy challenges. The physical match served as crucial preparation for the young US squad ahead of next year's World Cup tournament.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a dominant complete-game performance, allowing only three hits in a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the NLCS. After giving up a home run on the first pitch, Yamamoto settled in and shut down the Brewers' offense for the remainder of the game. The Dodgers' offense was powered by solo home runs from Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy, whose 14th career postseason homer set a new franchise record. The win gives the Dodgers a commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.</p>

          <p>A review of British newspaper headlines reveals major focus on international and domestic issues. Several papers report on Israel reducing aid to Gaza amid accusations that Hamas is withholding the bodies of hostages, creating a test for the fragile ceasefire. Domestically, economic news dominates, with reports on rising unemployment, the UK potentially having the highest inflation in the G7, and criticism directed at Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Other topics include the Home Secretary's concerns over border control and a European council's warning on UK trans rights policies.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County's Chief Executive Officer, Fesia Davenport, received a $2 million settlement from the county due to the professional and reputational harm caused by Measure G. This voter-approved measure will change her appointed position to an elected one by 2028, effectively making her current role obsolete. In a letter, Davenport stated the measure had an unprecedented and detrimental impact on her career, health, and future economic outlook. The settlement resolves any potential claims she might have brought against the county regarding the enactment of the ballot measure.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, some Chinese economic scholars believe that external pressure could inadvertently foster greater national unity and motivation within China. This perspective comes as both nations impose new punitive measures, including port fees and sanctions on shipping-related companies. One researcher noted it is part of the national character to transform external challenges into internal drive. These developments set a determined tone for China's upcoming fourth plenum, where leaders are expected to emphasize a long-term strategy of resilience against US economic pressure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.3% in September compared to the previous year, a larger drop than anticipated, signaling persistent deflationary challenges for the world's second-largest economy. This decline was primarily driven by sluggish domestic demand and falling food and energy prices, although core CPI saw a slight increase. Concurrently, the producer price index (PPI) also dropped by 2.3%, continuing a nearly three-year trend of factory-gate deflation that squeezes corporate profits. Economists suggest these figures indicate that ongoing trade tensions and weak consumer confidence are hindering a stable economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

On Truth Social, he criticized the image, taken from a low angle with backlighting, for making his hair seem to "disappear" and creating a strange halo effect. The former president, who has a long-documented fascination with appearing on the magazine's cover, called the photograph "super bad." Picture editors suggest the angle was likely chosen to create a heroic or powerful image, though it was not aesthetically flattering.</p>

Red Tractor criticized the decision as "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is on food safety and animal welfare, not environmental standards, and that it relies on government agencies for environmental enforcement.</p>

          <h2>NRA Sues California Over New Law Banning Handguns Convertible to Automatic Weapons</h2>

          <p>The National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups have filed a federal lawsuit against California over a new law that bans the sale of certain Glock-style semiautomatic pistols. The law targets handguns with a feature that allows for the easy attachment of a "switch," a device that illegally converts the weapon into a fully automatic machine gun. The lawsuit argues the ban violates the Second Amendment by prohibiting the sale of firearms that are in common use for lawful purposes. State officials contend the law is a necessary measure to combat gun violence, as converted weapons have been used in recent mass shootings.</p>

Cleary's ouster follows the recent resignation of the acting U.S. Attorney and the firings of two other high-level prosecutors. The series of personnel changes has raised concerns about political influence within the Justice Department, particularly as the office pursues cases against individuals who have been publicly targeted by President Trump.</p>

          <p>Members of the U.S. Air Force's 509th Bomb Wing have shared details about Operation Midnight Hammer, a 36-hour mission in June where B-2 Spirit stealth bombers struck three Iranian nuclear facilities. The commander described the raid as one of the most consequential of his lifetime, highlighting the B-2's unique combination of long-range capability, high payload, and stealth technology. The mission involved dropping 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs designed for deep underground targets. The recollection comes as President Trump announced the Pentagon is ordering 28 new B-2 bombers to modernize the fleet.</p>

Additionally, teens will be prevented from following or interacting with accounts that frequently post age-inappropriate material.

          <p>New U.S. tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets, lumber, and other housewares have officially taken effect. The Trump administration implemented the levies to protect domestic manufacturing from what it calls unfair foreign competition. However, economists warn that American consumers and businesses will likely bear the brunt of these new costs through higher prices. Analysis from Goldman Sachs suggests that consumers could ultimately absorb about 55% of the added costs, potentially increasing inflation for household goods and building materials.

Improperly disposed vape batteries have also been linked to a significant increase in fires at waste and recycling facilities, a phenomenon some have dubbed the "vapocalypse."</p>

The threat came after the Senate failed for an eighth time to pass a funding bill to end the impasse. While Trump did not specify which programs would be targeted, the move represents a significant escalation, using the shutdown as a basis for large-scale, politically motivated cuts to government services. This unprecedented tactic adds another layer of uncertainty for federal workers and the public services they provide.</p>

Participants reported feeling a strong sense of community and safety, and the act of singing itself was found to have a relaxing effect.
