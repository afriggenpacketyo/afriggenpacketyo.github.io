          <h2>Hugo Boss Shares Surge After Promising First-Quarter Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 05:03:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a significant jump after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, with revenues falling just 2% on a currency-adjusted basis to 999 million euros, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties, the company reiterated its full-year guidance, projecting sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to subdued consumer demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, but the company's strategic overhaul, including improvements in store formats and product diversification, has helped mitigate some of the negative impacts. Analysts suggest that while Hugo Boss has expanded its appeal, womenswear remains an area needing improvement.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has announced its plans to acquire British food delivery firm Deliveroo in a deal valued at £2.9 billion ($3.9 billion), marking a significant push into overseas markets. Deliveroo's board has agreed to DoorDash's offer of 180 pence per share, a 44% premium over Deliveroo's closing price on April 4, prior to the initial offer. This acquisition will expand DoorDash's reach to over 40 countries, covering a combined population of over 1 billion people, and provide more local businesses with necessary tools and technology. The financial terms are final, pending shareholder approval, with no increase expected unless a rival bid emerges.</p>

          <p>Federal funding cuts initiated by the Trump administration are rolling back progress in combating HIV in the South, impacting community-based organizations and health departments. These cuts, which include terminating research dollars and clawing back billions from health departments, are forcing groups to reduce HIV testing and outreach efforts. The cuts target programs built around diversity, equity, and inclusion, with officials stating they represent "immense public waste and shameful discrimination". Health experts warn that reducing these services will lead to more HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths, disproportionately affecting Black communities in the South, where HIV rates are already high.</p>

          <p>Despite facing massive tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein will remain dominant forces in the U.S. e-tail scene. The de minimis rule, which exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs, has been closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties as high as 120%. However, both companies have been preparing for this change by accelerating localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses. Experts suggest that Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and competitive pricing will enable them to adapt and continue competing effectively with rivals like Amazon.</p>

          <p>In an unexpected turn of events, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's conservative party, fell short of securing a majority in the initial parliamentary vote for chancellor, receiving only 310 votes out of the required 316 in the 630-seat Bundestag. This failure is unprecedented in modern German history, undermining his hopes of presenting a strong front after winning the federal elections two and a half months ago. The Bundestag now has 14 days to choose either Merz or another candidate as chancellor, and political commentators view this as a significant setback for Merz, likely inflicted by dissenting members of the Social Democrat SPD.</p>

          <p>A senior Hamas official stated that further talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are futile, following Israel's approval of an expanded offensive that could involve seizing all of Gaza indefinitely.

UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that expanded Israeli operations would lead to more civilian deaths and destruction.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in "foreign countries" has caused confusion and unease in Hollywood. The plan, reportedly influenced by Jon Voight, aims to restore US film production by incentivizing domestic filmmaking. However, the details of how such a tariff would be implemented remain unclear, given the globalized nature of the film industry. While the White House downplayed the severity of the tariffs, the mere threat has already stalled production plans and created uncertainty, potentially damaging the industry they are supposed to have helped.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created the world’s smallest and lightest wireless robot, capable of changing form to travel on land or in the air. Inspired by Lego, the microrobot could be used in complex environments like disaster rescue operations. The key to the microrobot is a “morphable actuator” that converts energy into force, which the researchers say could also be used in medical devices and virtual reality components. The robot has the smallest size, lightest weight, and fastest ground movement speed compared to other known wireless land-air robots.</p>

          <p>The takeover of Deliveroo by US counterpart DoorDash exemplifies the differing fortunes of US and UK stock markets. Both companies started as food delivery services but DoorDash's market value has soared compared to Deliveroo, which struggled after its London IPO. This deal underscores a broader trend: companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market for US listings due to higher valuations and greater access to capital. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has dwindled, and financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to invest in less risky assets, contributing to the UK market's undervaluation.</p>

          <p>A new UN report indicates that global development progress slowed in 2024, raising concerns that recent gains may be slipping due to stalled life expectancy, income growth, and rising conflicts. The annual Human Development Index (HDI) report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) warns that this slowdown could reverse decades of progress. UNDP chief Achim Steiner cited recent cuts to international aid by several countries, led by the United States, as exacerbating the issue. The report also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revitalize development but cautions that its benefits must be equitably shared to avoid deepening divides.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering restricting visa applications from nationalities deemed most likely to overstay and claim asylum, including Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. The Home Office believes some individuals come to the UK legally on work or study visas before claiming asylum, which, if granted, allows them to stay permanently. While the Home Office has not published recent statistics on visa overstays, the government plans to address this issue in an upcoming Immigration White Paper. Labour has also promised to reduce both illegal and legal migration, with plans to make endangering lives at sea a criminal offense and develop training plans for sectors reliant on migrant workers.</p>

She wants to incentivize talented physicians to work in Michigan and bolster reproductive health care in rural areas, including mobile clinics. In 2022, Michigan voters approved a ballot measure to protect abortion access, but Benson says that protection isn’t enough.</p>

          <p>Jon Voight, one of President Trump's "special ambassadors" to Hollywood, has reportedly provided the president with a partial roadmap to aid the Hollywood film industry. The plan involves federal tax incentives, tax code changes, co-production treaties with other countries, and infrastructure subsidies for cinema owners, film and television production companies, and post-production companies. Voight claimed that “people have lost their homes” and “can’t feed their families” due to productions that have gone overseas. The White House appeared to play down the severity of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 100% tariff on films produced outside the United States, citing concerns about the decline of the American movie industry. Trump complained that other countries are offering incentives to attract filmmakers and studios, calling it a national security threat. However, it is unclear how such a tariff would be implemented, given the global nature of film production. The Motion Picture Association (MPA) has not yet responded to the announcement, but MPA data shows that U.S. films generated $22.6 billion in exports and a $15.3 billion trade surplus in 2023.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's struggles in the Miami Grand Prix have raised questions about the team's performance and tire management. Team principal Frederic Vasseur admitted that the car's pace was not where Ferrari expected it to be at the start of this season, after running McLaren so close for the constructors' title last year. Lewis Hamilton won the sprint in China, but that seems to be a case of him and the team finding a good set-up after just one practice session, while others did not, and then benefiting from clean air at the start of the race. Stricter rules on front wing deflection that are being introduced at the subsequent race in Spain may make a difference.</p>

The dismissals, including senior leaders of the Rocket Force and Gen.

While China's military has made significant advancements, the internal turmoil and lack of battlefield experience among officers may weaken Xi's appetite for war.

          <p>In China, the children of senior officials are increasingly opting for jobs in the public sector, reversing a previous trend of pursuing lucrative careers in the private sector. This shift is attributed to the ruling Communist Party's tightening of rules around officials and their families as part of its anti-corruption drive, as well as a slowing economy. Government jobs, once seen as less attractive due to lower pay and greater constraints, are now viewed as more secure and desirable amid economic uncertainties and increased scrutiny of officials' families.</p>
