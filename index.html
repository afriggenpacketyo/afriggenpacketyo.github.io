          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles over federal immigration sweeps, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities, with some protesters halting traffic and setting vehicles ablaze. In response, the Trump administration deployed the California National Guard, prompting criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the move inflammatory and an overreach. The White House defended the deployment as necessary to address lawlessness, while Newsom requested the federal government rescind the order, fearing escalation of tensions and a breach of state sovereignty. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the division between federal and state authorities. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic demand and price wars, particularly in the automotive sector. The consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.1% year-on-year, slightly better than analysts' expectations. Despite stimulus measures, domestic consumption remains sluggish, and falling property prices contribute to downward pressure. Chinese policymakers are being urged to implement more forceful measures to boost consumption as trade tensions with the U.S. add further economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>

The Posse Comitatus Act generally bars the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist, including congressional decree or when state governments are unable to maintain order.

          <p>Jim Cramer argues that the U.S. lacks leverage in upcoming trade talks with China due to its reliance on China for rare earth minerals. He questions why the U.S. did not secure its rare earth supply chain before initiating a trade war. Cramer suggests that China's control over rare earth production gives them a significant advantage. He proposes a "Manhattan Project" for rare earths and a dual-track Nvidia deal to address the imbalance. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like Ocean Winds receive compensation payments when their wind turbines have to be turned down because the system is overloaded. The National Electricity System Operator (NESO) warns that balancing the grid in this way could cost almost Â£8 billion a year by 2030, pushing up energy bills.
