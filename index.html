          <p>This New York Times article examines President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land seizure policies, highlighting his false accusations of mass killings of white South Africans and land confiscation without payment. The article contrasts Trump's stance with his own administration's use of eminent domain to seize land for the border wall in Texas. It recounts how farmers were compelled to give up their land despite their opposition, illustrating the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of government land acquisition policies. The article underscores the importance of understanding the nuances of eminent domain and its impact on landowners, both domestically and internationally.</p>

He supported his argument by pointing out that the S&P 500 has outperformed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index over the past four decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican effort to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is facing challenges due to pressure from companies and congressmen with clean-energy projects in their districts. While Speaker Mike Johnson initially described the approach as somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer, President Trump's strong stance against the IRA as a "Green New Scam" has pushed for more aggressive measures. Trump's influence and threats of primary challenges have added to the complexity, making the future of the IRA uncertain.

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments following increasing political pressure. Over 10 million pensioners lost their payments when the pension top-up became means-tested last year. The policy will be changed at the autumn Budget to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again, although details remain unclear. The U-turn followed criticism from unions and pensioner charities, with some Labour MPs blaming the policy for recent election losses. The announcement raises questions about eligibility and the financial implications of the changes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $33 million in FEMA funds for earthquake retrofits in California, sparking concern from Senator Adam Schiff. The grants were intended to strengthen vulnerable apartment buildings, but FEMA deemed the program wasteful and politically motivated. This decision leaves many at risk, especially those in soft-story apartments, which are prone to collapse during earthquakes. Cities with mandatory retrofit laws are now facing funding shortfalls, potentially endangering residents. The cancellation raises questions about prioritizing disaster preparedness and protecting vulnerable populations.</p>

Despite the decline, Bitcoin has been steadily climbing in May, fueled by factors like softer U.S. inflation numbers and de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.
