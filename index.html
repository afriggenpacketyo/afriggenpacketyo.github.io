          <p>Sources indicate that Japan's Nippon Steel is expected to finalize its acquisition of U.S. Steel at $55 per share, a deal that President Trump has cleared, referring to it as a "partnership" involving a $14 billion investment by Nippon over the next 14 months. U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, and the company will have an American CEO with a majority of its board members from the U.S., according to Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick. The United Steelworkers union, however, remains concerned about Nippon's track record of violating trade laws and its potential impact on domestic steelmaking capacity and union jobs. The agreement includes a national security component, ensuring U.S. government approval over board members and production levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has indicated that the government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Phillipson warned that removing the cap would "cost a lot of money" but acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of its child poverty strategy, with the Child Poverty Taskforce assessing the cap and considering all options. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would prioritize different choices, recognizing the high "cost of inaction" on children's life chances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food inflation has risen to an annual high of 2.8% due to higher beef and fresh produce prices, according to industry data. Tomas Maunier, co-founder of steak restaurant chain Fazenda, reported that beef costs have increased by approximately 20% in the last year, forcing businesses to pass on some of these costs to consumers. Farming industry experts attribute the beef price increase to high demand and low supply resulting from a lack of government support. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), warned that the industry is struggling to keep up with beef demand due to government schemes favoring environmental initiatives over production support.</p>

However, complex situations involving large debts, IRS enforcement actions, or Offers in Compromise often warrant professional assistance from enrolled agents, CPAs, or tax attorneys.

          <p>Bivo, a small Vermont company selling water bottles, is struggling to adapt to President Trump’s tariffs on imports from China, even after they were temporarily reduced. The company, which was close to becoming profitable, now faces higher duties on its bottles, impacting sales and requiring a new business strategy. While Trump claims foreign businesses pay the tariffs, importers like Bivo are actually responsible for the duties, straining their cash flow. Despite these challenges, Bivo is exploring options like selling in Europe and negotiating better terms with its supplier to navigate the economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
