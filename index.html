        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, offering some relief from dollar-denominated debt and import inflation but also posing challenges to export competitiveness. While many central banks welcome a weaker dollar, potential retaliatory tariffs from the U.S. and risks of capital flight complicate decisions about currency devaluation. The European Central Bank recently cut rates, while the Swiss National Bank faces pressure from a strong franc, illustrating the diverse responses to the dollar's decline. Central banks are cautiously avoiding actions that could spark a currency war, aiming to maintain economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, requiring the reinstatement of legal statuses for 133 international students. The lawsuit claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated student records in a database, effectively ending their student status and making them deportable. The ACLU and other groups argue that this action coerces students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, despite not violating their status. Some students are nearing graduation or enrolled in work programs, adding urgency to the legal challenge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed both U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs and housing developer Karrin Taylor Robson in the Republican primary for Arizona governor. Trump's initial endorsement of Robson angered some allies due to her ties to the Republican establishment, while Biggs, a former Freedom Caucus chair, has been a staunch Trump supporter. Trump has issued dual endorsements in multiple races since 2017, with Robson expressing gratitude and Biggs' campaign stating it expected both candidates to be endorsed.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate a nearly $1-billion financial gap by cutting over 2,700 city positions, including 1,650 layoffs. The plan includes deep spending reductions across various agencies, with the LAPD facing significant civilian layoffs. Despite the cuts, the Fire Department would see new hires following the Palisades fire. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, while the mayor is seeking state financial aid to mitigate the job cuts.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making. The lawsuit challenges the administration's threat to review $9 billion in federal funding after Harvard refused to comply with demands, including appointing an outside overseer. Harvard argues that the government should not dictate what private universities teach or whom they admit. The lawsuit follows months of student activism related to the war in Gaza and the administration's claims of anti-Americanism and antisemitism on campuses.</p>

          <p>Following the Palisades wildfire, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is proposing to add 227 positions to the Fire Department, even as other city agencies face potential layoffs. The new positions would include firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and mechanics, addressing concerns about understaffing and equipment maintenance. The budget also includes a new Homeless Fire Protection and Street Medicine Program to address fires related to homelessness. The proposal is a response to criticisms that budget cuts hampered the department's ability to fight the recent wildfire.</p>

Hegseth shared details of the Houthi strike plans with a chat that included his two family members and his lawyer. Some in the White House and the Pentagon have begun speculating about Hegseth's shelf life and have even begun circulating the names of possible replacements. One Republican lawmaker has broken rank and said the chaos now on display at the Pentagon is one reason that many Hill Republicans had been privately uneasy with Hegseth’s nomination in the first place.</p>
