          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>LVMH shares experienced a significant drop after reporting a decline in first-quarter sales, causing it to temporarily lose its position as the world's largest luxury firm to Hermès. The sales miss was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China, particularly for wines and spirits, while the fashion and leather goods division also saw a decrease. Analysts expressed concern about the luxury sector's near-term prospects due to economic uncertainty and trade tensions. LVMH is closely monitoring the potential impact of tariffs on input costs and consumer demand, but has not seen a major change in trend. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that the U.S. is unable to replace rare earth elements supplied by China, posing a threat to its defense capabilities. China's export controls on these elements, crucial for advanced defense technologies, could disrupt supply to U.S. firms. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on China for heavy rare earth processing. While the Department of Defense is working to develop a domestic supply chain, it will take time to become operational and meet U.S. defense needs.</p>

            <p>A high-level international conference is underway in London, co-chaired by the UK, EU, and African Union, to address the ongoing civil war in Sudan and find a "pathway to peace." The UK is pledging additional aid to address the humanitarian crisis, with 30 million people in desperate need. The conference aims to unite international partners and chart a path to end hostilities, though neither of Sudan's main warring parties have been invited. The African Union emphasizes that there is no military solution and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p>

This concept reflects Beijing's view of a declining U.S. and a rising China, though they rarely express this explicitly. The chaotic nature of Trump's policies is seen as accelerating a global reordering where American influence wanes.

His advisors hope tariffs will incentivize a U.S. manufacturing boom and reduce dependence on China. They also seek a global agreement to weaken the dollar, boosting U.S. exports. However, tariffs can make imports more expensive, hurting businesses and consumers, and could lead to economic damage. (not investment advice)</p>
