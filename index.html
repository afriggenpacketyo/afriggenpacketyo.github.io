          <p>German Economy Minister Robert Habeck believes that unified European pressure will force President Trump to revise his recently imposed tariffs.  Habeck expressed confidence in Europe's ability to withstand Trump's trade policies. Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also criticized the tariffs, calling them fundamentally wrong and harmful to the global economy.  The tariffs, announced Wednesday, impose a 20% levy on the European Union, significantly impacting Germany's trade-dependent economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs could impact the UK economy in several ways.  Prices of goods could rise due to increased import costs for UK businesses.  The tariffs could also affect UK jobs, particularly in export-oriented sectors such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.  Uncertainty remains about the overall economic impact, with some economists suggesting that prices could potentially fall initially due to trade diversion.  Interest rates may remain higher for longer as a result of inflationary pressures.</p>
