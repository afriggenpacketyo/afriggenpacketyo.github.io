Bailey mentioned that the convertible note carries a premium to the PIPE price, with investors buying shares at $1.12, but the notes will convert at $2.80 and that the notes are zero-coupon for the first two years.

          <p>This article discusses optimal scenarios for using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in 2025, emphasizing that home equity can be a viable financing source, particularly with HELOC interest rates currently under 8%. The article suggests using a HELOC for financing home renovation projects, as interest paid on such projects is tax-deductible, making it a cost-effective option. Additionally, it highlights that a HELOC can be beneficial when price changes are affordable, given its variable interest rate, and when seeking the cheapest home equity borrowing option compared to alternatives like home equity loans, cash-out refinancing, or personal loans. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual financial circumstances and needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices in the United States by asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce prices, but the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate these reductions. The executive order calls on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices and to push them to pay more, but it's unclear if this approach will be effective. Pharmaceutical stocks rose following the announcement, indicating that investors viewed the policy as less damaging than anticipated. Experts have expressed skepticism, describing the order as more of an aspirational statement than a serious attempt to initiate policy change, with many suggesting that Congress needs to pass a law to ensure a durable policy.</p>

          <p>Yeshiva University has reversed its decision to recognize an LGBTQ+ student club, citing violations of Jewish principles and the legal settlement. The university argued that the club, previously known as Pride Alliance but renamed Hareni, was operating as a pride club under a different name, which is antithetical to the Torah values of the institution. Lawyers for the students claim that the university violated the agreement with hostile religious rhetoric, including restrictions on social events and the use of Pride symbols. This decision comes amid increasing concerns about the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans and has sparked disappointment among the club members.</p>

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with a plan to lower U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, but experts anticipate significant challenges in implementing this policy. The executive order directs federal agencies to cut prices, aiming to equalize them with lower prices abroad, affecting both commercial and public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Health policy experts are skeptical about the feasibility of reducing prices significantly and question whether other nations and drugmakers will comply. The pharmaceutical industry has criticized the plan, arguing it will hurt profits and research, while analysts suggest congressional approval and legal challenges are likely hurdles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, with the Education Department providing details on the timeline for wage garnishments and other involuntary collections. The government can garnish up to 15% of a borrower's disposable pay, leaving them with at least $217.50 per week. Borrowers will receive a 30-day notice before garnishment begins and have the option to request a hearing before an administrative law judge. The wage garnishments may be challenged if they result in financial hardship, or if the borrower has recently been unemployed or filed for bankruptcy. Borrowers can get out of default by contacting the government's Default Resolution Group and enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation.</p>

Hamas stated the release was unconditional, hoping to work toward a lasting ceasefire and renew humanitarian aid to Gaza, while Netanyahu's office emphasized that Israel made no commitment to a ceasefire or release of terrorists.

          <p>This New York Times article explores the evolving understanding of the "closet" within queer culture, prompted by Paul Reubens' revelation about concealing his sexuality for professional reasons. The article reflects on how the concept of being "in the closet" has transformed from a binary state to a more complex spectrum, especially with increased visibility and acceptance of LGBTQ+ identities. It also discusses the resurgence of interest in closeted characters in media, potentially driven by nostalgia for a time when gay identity was more central to queer culture, and the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals. The article ultimately argues that the decision to remain silent about one's identity can have significant and lasting consequences, both personally and culturally.</p>

The release of the last living American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, has been framed as a chance to revive peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas.

          <p>President Trump's imposition and subsequent reduction of triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products demonstrated the power of U.S. trade policy but also highlighted the limitations of his aggressive approach. The tariffs disrupted global trade, causing companies to reroute business and impacting both Chinese factories and American importers. Despite the disruptions, trade talks in Geneva concluded with an agreement to reduce levies, but without any immediate concessions from China beyond a commitment to continue negotiations. The agreement represents a retreat from the U.S., calling into question whether the trade disruptions were worth it, with experts noting that it did not generate any immediate concessions from the Chinese other than a commitment to keep talking.</p>

          <p>A group of White South Africans arrived in the United States after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration, citing "egregious discrimination" in South Africa. The administration alleges that the White minority in South Africa faces discrimination, including through a controversial land seizure law, while the South African government denies these claims. The resettlement process occurred rapidly, despite a broader effort by the Trump administration to suspend the refugee admission program. One refugee group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, declined to assist with the resettlement, citing a commitment to racial justice and reconciliation.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the increasing cost of living in major U.S. cities, highlighting that renters now need to earn at least $100,000 annually to live comfortably in cities like Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose. Zillow calculates that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental. New York City tops the list, requiring an annual income of roughly $135,000 to afford rent, while more affordable options can be found in cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where renters need to earn around $55,000. The problem is rooted in an inadequate housing supply, with construction not keeping pace with demand.</p>

The investigation identified several alleged money laundering accomplices, with those arrested facing prosecution in Ivory Coast under cybercrime statutes.
