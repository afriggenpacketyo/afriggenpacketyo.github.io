          <p>A gunman killed an NYPD officer and three civilians in a shooting spree inside a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas, reportedly traveled cross-country with a high-powered rifle and may have intended to target the NFL offices located in the building. The slain officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year veteran of the force and leaves behind a pregnant wife and two young sons. An NFL employee was also seriously wounded in the attack, and the motive remains under investigation by authorities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union has marginalized itself in global power dynamics due to a lack of a cohesive and autonomous strategy regarding China. The author contends that by submitting to U.S. pressure and failing to assert its own interests, Brussels has become an irrelevant player, unable to secure meaningful concessions from either Beijing or Washington. The piece suggests that the EU's adherence to liberal principles is ineffective in a world governed by realist power politics. This strategic failure has allegedly relegated Europe from a strategic partner to a dependent client of the United States.</p>

          <p>A new executive order signed by President Trump aims to change the national approach to homelessness, focusing on moving people from the streets into treatment for mental illness or addiction. The administration claims that previous federal spending has failed to address the root causes of the issue. However, advocates and critics featured in this article express worry that the order could lead to forcing individuals into treatment without solving the underlying problems. They fear this new policy might not provide the comprehensive support needed and could infringe on individual rights.</p>

          <p>Officials in Anchorage, Alaska, are cautioning hikers to be vigilant and avoid salmon-rich streams after two people were mauled by bears in separate incidents within a week. Both hikers survived the attacks, which occurred near populated areas within the sprawling municipality known for its urban-wildlife interface. One incident involved a brown bear sow protecting her cub, while the species of bear in the other attack is still being determined. Authorities are not seeking to kill the sow, as it was acting defensively, and are advising the public to travel in groups, make noise, and carry bear spray.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein "stole" Virginia Giuffre from her job at the Mar-a-Lago spa in the early 2000s. Speaking to reporters, Trump stated this was one of multiple instances where Epstein poached employees, which he said led him to sever ties with his then-friend. Giuffre, who died earlier this year, had publicly alleged that she was sexually abused by Epstein as a teenager after being recruited by his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, while working at the club. Trump's comments come amid ongoing legal and political fallout surrounding his relationship with Epstein.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the Pentagon's recent decision to ban its employees from participating in think tank conferences is motivated by resentment, insecurity, and fear. The author suggests Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his staff may be avoiding these forums to prevent being outmatched by experts or making public statements that could anger President Trump. The piece contends that this isolationist policy is a self-protective measure that will ultimately damage civil-military relations and hinder the exchange of ideas crucial for national defense.

          <p>In an interview, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), addressed major challenges facing the U.S. healthcare system. He defended new Medicaid work requirements, stating that technology like smartphone apps could streamline compliance and prevent eligible people from losing coverage due to paperwork. Oz also vowed to crack down on Medicare Advantage fraud, particularly the practice of "upcoding" to inflate payments, promising audits that could recover billions from private insurers. He described his tougher stance on fraud by stating, "There is a new sheriff in town."</p>

          <p>The gunman in the Manhattan office tower shooting left a note blaming the NFL for giving him chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease linked to head injuries. This article explores the league's long and controversial history with CTE, from early denials to landmark lawsuits filed by former players. It details several high-profile cases of former players who suffered from the disease, which can only be diagnosed posthumously and is associated with cognitive decline and behavioral changes. The shooter's note, which requested his brain be studied, has reignited the debate over football's safety and its long-term health consequences.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could have a varied impact across the drug manufacturing industry, according to analysts. Companies like Novartis and Roche, with extensive overseas manufacturing, appear more at risk, while firms with larger U.S. production footprints like AbbVie and Eli Lilly may be better positioned. The article notes that while some drugmakers have announced new U.S. facilities, it will take years for them to become operational. Analysts suggest that significant tariffs could pressure companies to cut R&D spending and would be politically difficult to offset entirely with price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawyer argued that testifying now could compromise her ongoing legal appeals unless she receives formal protection from further criminal exposure.

The company says the feature is intended to enhance safety on the platform, which is the most popular social media app among teens.</p>

          <p>UCLA has agreed to a $6.45 million settlement in a federal lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor who alleged the university violated their civil rights during a pro-Palestinian encampment in 2024. The plaintiffs claimed UCLA enabled antisemitism by allowing activists to create a "Jew Exclusion Zone" that blocked their access to parts of campus. As part of the deal, UCLA is prohibited from facilitating the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas and will donate funds to Jewish community groups and an anti-antisemitism initiative. This is believed to be the largest such payout related to campus protests since October 2023.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent trip to Scotland, which mixed official geopolitics with personal business and family heritage. While Trump held meetings with UK and Scottish leaders at his golf resort, the visit was met with protests and a generally unenthusiastic public reception, as his politics do not align with most Scots. The piece notes the delicate political tightrope Scotland's First Minister John Swinney walked, balancing policy needs like lifting U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky with public disapproval of Trump. The analysis concludes that Trump's significant business interests ensure he will remain a feature in Scottish politics.</p>

          <p>Hundreds gathered in Southport, UK, for a three-minute silence to commemorate the one-year anniversary of a knife attack that killed three young girls. Bebe King, Alice Aguiar, and Elsie Dot Stancombe were murdered during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop on July 29, 2024, an event that also left ten others seriously injured. Community leaders and Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed sorrow and solidarity with the families and the town. In lieu of large vigils, local churches opened for quiet reflection, honoring the families' wishes and remembering the profound impact of the tragedy on the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the political motivations and potential impact of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's conditional pledge to recognize a Palestinian state. The article suggests the move is a response to intense pressure from within his own Labour party and the public, but questions the realism of the conditions placed on both Israel and Hamas. Given the right-wing composition of Israel's government and Hamas's entrenched position, meeting the demands for a ceasefire, no West Bank annexation, and disarmament seems unlikely. The piece concludes that while the announcement is a major policy shift, its ultimate effect may be more symbolic than substantive.</p>
