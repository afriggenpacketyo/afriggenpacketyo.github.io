        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Immigration lawyers have accused the Trump administration of illegally deporting two Asian men, citizens of Myanmar and Vietnam, to South Sudan, a country plagued by conflict and poverty. The attorneys filed an emergency order to prevent the deportations after a flight carrying a dozen people landed in South Sudan. A previous court order requires that illegal migrants have a chance to challenge removal to countries other than their homelands. The Department of Homeland Security has been contacted for comment on the matter, as the judge issued a ruling requiring that illegal migrants have a chance to challenge removal to countries other than their homelands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump urged House Republicans to support his legislative agenda, specifically cautioning them against altering Medicaid provisions within the bill. This comes as some Republicans are pushing for stricter Medicaid cuts, creating a sticking point that threatens the bill's passage. Trump also addressed concerns regarding state and local tax deductions, urging Republicans to accept the current deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the legislation, decrying it for what he called the "largest" cut to Medicaid and nutritional assistance in American history, and the White House official noted that Trump is losing patience with the Republican holdouts, including the SALT Caucus and the House Freedom Caucus.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S. face immediate loss of legal status and work authorization after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to eliminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The decision affects over 350,000 Venezuelans who received TPS under the Biden administration, leaving them vulnerable to detention and deportation. Many have U.S.-born children, homes, and jobs, and now fear family separation and return to a country facing humanitarian crisis.

          <p>A New York Times article reports that if Republicans pass their proposed tax and spending bill, the U.S. national debt could soon exceed the record set at the end of World War II, reaching over 113% of the nation’s economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that without changes to existing law, the debt will rise to about 117% of the economy’s size by 2034. The Republican bill would widen the gap by extending tax cuts and increasing military spending, potentially reaching 129% of the economy by 2034. Economists worry that high debt levels could make it harder for the government to borrow money during future crises. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is seen by some as an attempt to punish criticism and intimidate Democrats, given Trump's history of politicizing the Justice Department. The charges against McIver are contrasted with the Justice Department's handling of cases related to the January 6th insurrection, where cases against rioters have been dismissed and some have been pardoned, raising concerns about the administration's commitment to defending federal law-enforcement officers.</p>

          <p>A New York Times guest essay argues that the Trump presidency is marked by a wanton destructiveness targeting various institutions, including law, education, medical research, and international alliances. Scholars note the gutting of expertise and experience, likening Trump to Andrew Johnson in preventing racial reconciliation and economic opportunity. The article suggests Trump's agenda is driven by conservative elites seeking to advance their programs, with potentially long-lasting damage to America's reputation and global standing.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily blocked the Temecula Valley unified school district's ban on critical race theory (CRT), citing the vague nature and lack of legal terminology in the resolution. The court expressed concerns about "confusion and fear" among educators and the negative impact on education, noting that teachers were unsure how to respond to student questions about sensitive topics like slavery. The decision is part of an ongoing legal battle over the CRT ban, which was adopted in 2022.</p>

Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, and the PSA test, while useful, is not foolproof. Experts emphasize that fast-growing cancers can arise between screenings or may not be detected by PSA tests, and that treatments for prostate cancer can have devastating side effects, such as incontinence and impotence.</p>
