          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to ask President Trump for advanced long-range weapons, upgraded air defense systems, and enhanced intelligence sharing. The request aims to bolster Ukraine's ability to target Russia's critical energy sector, a key source of funding for Moscow's war effort. This diplomatic push comes as both nations continue to strike each other's energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, and as the U.S. Congress considers further sanctions against Russia to cripple its oil sales.</p>

          <p>Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group has banned Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an upcoming match against Aston Villa due to significant safety concerns. West Midlands Police classified the fixture as "high risk," citing current intelligence and violent clashes involving the team's fans at a match in Amsterdam in 2024. The decision has ignited a political firestorm, with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling it "wrong," while the government seeks to find a way to overturn the ban and ensure the game can be safely attended by all supporters.</p>

This committee is responsible for overseeing all government spending and ensuring taxpayer money is used effectively. The Conservative party justified the appointment by stating Lowe "shares our values on cutting waste," while the move drew sharp criticism from the Labour party, which questioned his fiscal credibility and the Tories' judgment.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is set to pay an additional $828 million to resolve another 400 cases of alleged sexual abuse that occurred in county-run facilities. This new payout comes just months after the county approved a record-breaking $4 billion settlement for thousands of similar claims. The announcement follows recent reports of potential fraud within the initial settlement process, prompting county officials to implement stronger vetting procedures to protect taxpayer funds while ensuring legitimate victims are compensated.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank has issued a short-term "buy" rating for DuPont, citing the upcoming spinoff of its electronics division, Qnity, as a major catalyst for unlocking shareholder value. Analysts contend that the company's current stock price represents a significant discount compared to the combined value of its component parts. Following this positive outlook, the CNBC Investing Club announced its intention to hold onto its shares in both the original DuPont entity and the newly formed Qnity, noting the spinoff's strong growth potential.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats are engaging in a self-defeating political strategy by continuing the government shutdown over disputes concerning Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid. The author asserts that as the minority party without control of the presidency or Congress, their negotiating position is inherently weak and unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, the piece contends that public opinion is beginning to shift, with more Americans blaming Democrats for the stalemate, suggesting their focus on these issues is politically damaging.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has lifted all travel restrictions for Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist and former Columbia University student who is currently fighting a deportation case initiated by the Trump administration. Khalil was arrested earlier this year as part of a crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activism. His lawyers successfully argued that the restrictions violated his First Amendment right to speak at events across the country, and the judge agreed, ruling that he was not a flight risk.</p>

          <p>The data center capacity around Milan, Italy's financial capital, is projected to surge tenfold over the next five years, adding approximately two gigawatts of power consumption. This massive expansion is driven by the rapidly growing demands of artificial intelligence technologies. The CEO of local utility A2A stated that this growth presents a major opportunity, and regional authorities are already working to increase both renewable and thermal electricity generation to meet the anticipated demand without straining the local grid.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has enthusiastically welcomed President Trump's announcement of a planned peace summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. Orbán, a close ally of both leaders, declared that Hungary is prepared to host the meeting, calling it "great news for the peace-loving people of the world." The choice of Hungary as the venue is significant, as Orbán's government has consistently opposed European military and financial support for Ukraine and has been accused of echoing Russian talking points.</p>

Tyson also reiterated his skepticism about alien visitations to Earth, pointing to the conspicuous absence of clear, high-resolution evidence despite the global proliferation of cameras, while still affirming the likelihood of life elsewhere in the cosmos.</p>

          <p>After maintaining a presence for over 60 years, CBS News has closed its workspace in the Pentagon, joining nearly every other major news organization in protesting new press requirements. The new policy mandates that journalists receive formal authorization before publishing certain types of unclassified information, a condition that press freedom advocates argue infringes on First Amendment rights. The move marks the end of an era where direct, daily access to the building was considered essential for reporting on national security.</p>
