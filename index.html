          <p>Cava's stock fell over 20% after the company reduced its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth from a range of 6-8% to 4-6%. The adjustment came after second-quarter sales growth of 2.1% fell significantly short of Wall Street's 6.1% projection. While the company's revenue grew due to new store openings, the slowdown in established locations, particularly after lapping the successful launch of a steak option, prompted the revised outlook. Cava also announced an investment in an automation company to improve order efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and California Governor Gavin Newsom's administration are in a legal battle over the president's authority to deploy military forces for domestic law enforcement. The federal government argued in a California court that President Trump acted legally when he sent the National Guard and Marines to address immigration riots in Los Angeles. The case, heard by a judge who is the brother of a retired Supreme Court justice, tests the limits of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. This law generally prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement without specific authorization.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets rallied significantly on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq moving toward record highs after the latest inflation data came in better than expected. The July report showed the annual inflation rate held steady at 2.7%, slightly below economists' forecasts. This positive data increased investor hopes that the Federal Reserve will have the justification it needs to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, providing a boost to the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This potential move follows other policy changes under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, and could leave many young children without an available COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, E. J. Antoni, recently suggested that the agency should suspend its monthly jobs reports. Antoni, an economist from the Heritage Foundation, expressed concerns about the accuracy of the monthly data, which is a crucial economic indicator for markets and the Federal Reserve. This nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS Commissioner, whom he accused of rigging the reports. The White House defended the choice, stating the president wants to ensure the agency produces accurate data.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department under the Trump administration has significantly rewritten and scaled back its annual global human rights report. The revised document lessens criticism of allies like Israel and El Salvador while increasing disapproval of countries like Brazil and South Africa. It also eliminates entire sections on topics such as government corruption and LGBTQ+ persecution, a move critics call an "abandonment of core values." The report was reportedly delayed due to internal dissent and reflects a broader shift in the administration's foreign policy priorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent move to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force and implement a sweeping overhaul of the city faces significant legal and practical challenges. While Trump has promised to tackle crime and homelessness, his authority is constrained by the 1973 Home Rule Act, which limits such federal control to 30 days without congressional approval. Critics, including D.C.'s attorney general, have called the action unlawful, noting that crime rates are actually at a 30-year low. The plan sets up a conflict between presidential ambitions and limited federal power over municipal governance.</p>

          <p>An ice dam at Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier has begun to release a massive volume of water, prompting evacuation orders for residents in parts of Juneau. The phenomenon, known as a glacier outburst flood, occurs annually when the basin behind the glacier fills with meltwater and forces its way out. Officials are predicting a record flood this year, potentially surpassing the destructive events of the past two years which damaged hundreds of homes. This recurring threat is expected to continue for decades as the retreating glacier continues to form a dam.</p>

          <p>The Paraguayan government is proposing a new law to encourage the local assembly of electronic and digital goods using imported components, primarily from China. Ministers presented the plan to lawmakers as a way to create jobs and diversify the economy by shifting from importing finished products to assembling them domestically. The initiative is seen as an opportunity to position Paraguay as an attractive assembly hub, capitalizing on global trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods. This debate is occurring as Paraguay also considers its diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.</p>

This follows President Trump's announcement that he negotiated the deal directly with Nvidia. The move is controversial, as it reopens a market previously restricted for national security reasons.

          <p>The White House has informed the Smithsonian Institution of its plan to conduct a wide-ranging review of its 19 museums to ensure exhibits align with a "patriotic" narrative. The review, prompted by a presidential executive order, aims to eliminate what the administration deems "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" from the nation's cultural institutions. The scrutiny will extend to exhibition text, curatorial processes, and artist grants ahead of the U.S. 250th anniversary in 2026. Critics view this as an unprecedented move to assert political control over cultural representation.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash, can be a useful tool but come with significant risks. While most are federally insured, which offers some protections, borrowers can still face foreclosure if they fail to pay property taxes and insurance. The loan balance grows over time, which can deplete the home's equity, affecting a senior's ability to fund future housing needs or leave an inheritance. Experts advise seniors to fully understand the long-term obligations and work only with reputable lenders.</p>
