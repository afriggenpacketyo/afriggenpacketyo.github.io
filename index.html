          <p>A leader of a notorious Mexican drug cartel, Jorge Humberto Figueroa, also known as "El Perris," was killed in a clash with army troops in Sinaloa state. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had offered a $1 million bounty for information leading to his arrest on suspicion of fentanyl trafficking and money laundering. Figueroa was a key figure in a 2019 clash with authorities in Culiacan, where cartel members fought to release Ovidio Guzman, son of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who was later re-arrested and extradited to the U.S. This incident highlights the ongoing conflict between rival factions within the Sinaloa cartel. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government rules may allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to meet agreed-upon delivery time frames. Housebuilders will be required to commit to specific time frames before obtaining planning permission and submit annual progress reports to councils. Developers who repeatedly miss targets could face penalties or be denied future permissions, with fines potentially reaching thousands per unbuilt home. The government aims to address the housing crisis by building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, while housing charities emphasize the need for more social housing construction. </p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after mistakenly arresting a 19-year-old undocumented college student, Ximena Arias Cristobal, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The officer pulled over Arias Cristobal for an improper turn and driving without a license, but officials later determined the wrong vehicle was stopped. Traffic charges against Arias Cristobal were dismissed, and ICE released her after an immigration judge granted her bond. Her father, also detained by ICE, was released on bond as well, though both still face deportation proceedings. </p>

O.C.G., who is gay, had applied for asylum in the U.S. after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala, but was deported despite a judge's order protecting him. The judge criticized the government's actions, stating the deportation lacked due process and highlighted O.C.G.'s fear of returning to both Mexico and Guatemala.

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis aiming to undermine Hamas's control. The plan involves private contractors distributing aid, bypassing the United Nations, which Israeli officials accuse of anti-Israeli bias. The initiative, supported by former CIA officer Philip F. Reilly and Jake Wood, a former U.S. Marine, seeks to prevent aid from reaching militants and shift distribution to Israeli-controlled zones. However, U.N. officials warn that the plan could restrict aid access, endanger civilians, and potentially facilitate displacement from northern Gaza. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution and having reported violence he experienced there. The judge criticized the government for claiming O.C.G. did not fear being sent to Mexico, where he was allegedly sexually assaulted and held captive, and found that his removal lacked due process. The ruling adds to a series of court findings against the administration's deportation policies. The Guatemalan government is aware of the order and attempting to locate the man. </p>
