          <p>An excerpt from Mark Whitaker's book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," delves into the artistic decisions made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in creating the 1992 film "Malcolm X." The article details the extensive efforts to recreate historical settings, including Roxbury and the Audubon Ballroom, for pivotal scenes in Malcolm X's life. It also highlights Lee's inclusion of cameo appearances by figures who interacted with Malcolm X, such as Bobby Seale and Reverend Al Sharpton. The excerpt further describes the psychological challenge Lee faced in portraying Malcolm's premonition of his own death and the artistic techniques used to convey this sense of fatalism.</p>

          <p>Lydia Mugambe, a senior judge who also worked for the United Nations, received a sentence of six years and four months in prison in the UK after being convicted of enslaving a young Ugandan woman.

Mugambe was convicted under the Modern Slavery Act on multiple charges, including conspiring to breach immigration law and intimidating a witness.

This number surpasses the 207 deaths reported last year, and the CDC estimates at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations, and 26,000 deaths from the flu this season overall. Experts attribute the severity of the season to lower flu vaccination rates among children, which have fallen from 64% five years ago to 49% this season.

          <p>Nonfarm payrolls in the U.S. increased by 177,000 in April, surpassing expectations despite concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, indicating a stable labor market. The report comes amid an uncertain economic climate due to Trump's tariffs, which have led to concerns about a potential recession. Health care and transportation were among the sectors that saw job gains, while the federal government reported a slight loss of jobs amid efforts to trim payrolls in the public sector. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% for the month.</p>

          <p>The Canadian federal election witnessed significant shifts in party representation, with 17% of seats changing hands. While the government did not change, several party leaders lost their seats, including the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. The Liberal Party experienced a turnaround, while the NDP lost 17 of the 24 seats they were defending, potentially losing official party status. All 58 seats that flipped went to either the Liberals or Conservatives, indicating a shift away from Canada's smaller parties. The Bloc Québécois also lost 12 seats in Quebec.</p>

Smolny, once a bastion of independent thought, faced government intervention, leading to the dismantling of its liberal arts program and purging of dissenting faculty. The author argues that Columbia's compliance with government demands, including increased campus security and scrutiny of academic departments, echoes the tactics used to suppress academic freedom at Smolny.
