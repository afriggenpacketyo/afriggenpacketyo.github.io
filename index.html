            <h2>Judge Finds Probable Cause for Criminal Contempt Against Trump Administration in Deportation Case</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-17 07:26:01 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A federal judge has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying an order against deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador. Judge James Boasberg cited a willful disregard for the court's order and gave the administration a week to rectify the situation or identify those responsible for the decision. The White House plans to seek immediate appellate relief, while the ACLU, representing the plaintiffs, remains focused on the return of those deported without due process. This legal development stems from the Trump administration's efforts to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.</p>

            <p>Postmortems of 15 paramedics and rescue workers killed by Israeli troops in Gaza reveal they died mostly from gunshots to the head and torso, as well as explosive injuries. The killings sparked international outrage, particularly after the UN claimed the bodies were executed 'one by one' after being buried in a mass grave. Doctors Without Borders has described Gaza as becoming a 'mass grave for Palestinians' due to blocked aid supplies. Meanwhile, a US senator reports being denied a request to meet with a wrongly deported constituent in El Salvador, highlighting further human rights concerns.</p>

            <p>King Charles has issued an Easter message highlighting the efforts of humanitarian workers amidst war and disaster, while also promoting interfaith connections. Speaking ahead of the traditional Maundy Service at Durham Cathedral, the King acknowledged the "paradox of human life," contrasting the heroism of aid workers with the suffering caused by conflict. He also lauded the launch of a new Humanitarian Medal honoring those who risk their lives to help others. The King emphasized the importance of faith, hope, and love, particularly love for others, as core messages across religions.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, met its goals in a late-stage trial involving patients with Type 2 diabetes, demonstrating reductions in blood sugar and body weight. The pill's safety profile was comparable to existing injections, potentially offering a more convenient, needle-free alternative in the weight loss market. Patients lost an average of 7.9% of their weight after 40 weeks, with no plateau observed. The company plans to seek regulatory approval for obesity by the end of the year and for diabetes in 2026, potentially alleviating supply shortages of popular injections. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>During the April Monthly Meeting, Jim Cramer and Jeff Marks from the Investing Club addressed member questions on portfolio rebalancing during uncertain times, the importance of forward price-to-earnings ratios, and strategies for building new positions.

The experts also advised investors to look at forward P/E ratios for a better sense of a stock's direction and to scale into new positions gradually, preferably at lower prices. Investors should also consider their tax situations. (not investment advice)</p>

Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that instability in the global economy would inevitably affect Russia, despite its efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability amid sanctions. Analysts suggest Russia's reaction has been mixed, ranging from relief to concern over global volatility, and that Moscow sees potential benefits in a less globalized U.S. engaged in conflict with China. Russia still faces potential impacts from any widespread trade disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell will meet with Rev. Al Sharpton to discuss the retailer's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which has led to calls for a boycott and a slowdown in foot traffic. Sharpton is considering calling for a boycott if Target doesn't reaffirm its commitment to the Black community and invest in Black-owned businesses. Target's decision to end its DEI goals in January has been met with criticism from civil rights groups, and foot traffic at Target stores has declined for 10 straight weeks since the announcement. This situation marks a significant pushback against conservative activists' efforts to dismantle DEI initiatives.</p>

The agreement between DHS and DoD allows for the detention of migrants with final deportation orders who have a connection to a transnational criminal organization or criminal drug activity, with "nexus" defined broadly. This has raised concerns that many asylum-seekers could be sent to Guantanamo without individualized assessments, potentially violating due process. The ACLU is challenging the effort in court.</p>

            <p>American winemakers are expressing concern over President Trump's tariffs, fearing increased costs for essential supplies like glass bottles, corks, and barrels. Despite the potential advantage over European wines, winemakers worry that tariffs will disrupt the supply chain and force them to raise prices, potentially deterring consumers. They also fear that strained relationships with distributors, who rely on imported wines, could hurt their ability to reach customers. The industry faces uncertainty and potential challenges to its profitability due to the tariffs' impact on the wine supply chain.</p>

            <p>Shares of Hertz experienced a significant surge after a regulatory filing revealed that Bill Ackman's Pershing Square had acquired a substantial stake in the rental car company. Pershing Square has since increased its position to become Hertz's second-largest shareholder. Hertz has faced financial challenges in recent years, including bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic and losses related to its investment in electric vehicles. Ackman's investment firm received an exemption from the SEC to delay the filing, enabling it to accumulate more shares. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A writer travels to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to explore the anticipation surrounding the NFL draft, an event expected to draw a quarter of a million people to the small city. The draft, once a series of hotel conference rooms, has transformed into a three-day outdoor festival with music and kids' camps. Despite the global market collapse, the draft provides a welcome distraction and a sense of hope for fans eager to see their team secure promising players. The author contrasts the large-scale NFL draft with the smaller, less noticed draft of The Hundred, a cricket tournament in England.</p>

Harvard President Alan Garber rejected the demands as an attempt to regulate the university's "intellectual conditions."

            <p>President Trump's recent tariff announcements have negatively impacted his public support, raising questions about whether they are eroding his working-class coalition. While his economic approval ratings have declined, the Republican Party has largely maintained its standing with voters. The public seems to be differentiating between Trump and the GOP, with many still viewing the party as better suited to represent the working class. However, Democrats have struggled to capitalize on the public's economic discontent, as they have not effectively reclaimed the mantle of fighting for the working class.</p>
