            <p>China's economy often experiences a strong start to the year, referred to as "open door red," but momentum tends to wane as summer approaches, leading to a "summer blue" period. This pattern was evident last year when robust first-quarter growth of 5.3% decelerated to 4.7% in the second quarter. Economists anticipate impressive first-quarter GDP growth this year, estimating an average of 5.16%, but concerns remain about whether this momentum can be sustained throughout the year, given historical trends and ongoing economic challenges. The release of China's first-quarter GDP is scheduled for Wednesday.</p>

Despite the court's unanimous decision, Trump officials are misrepresenting the order and claiming the U.S. is powerless to return Abrego Garcia.
