        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to temporarily halt operations at 99 contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide has been blocked by a U.S. District Judge. The Labor Department cited poor outcomes and serious incident reports as reasons for the "phased pause" in the program, which provides career training, housing, and assistance to young people. However, Job Corps contractors sued the administration, arguing that the White House does not have the authority to dismantle a program established and funded by Congress. The ruling came after both Republican and Democratic lawmakers denounced the administration's move, citing the importance of the program for disadvantaged youth. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the man accused of attacking a group of demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order came after the family was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who were processing them for removal proceedings. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives violates the foundations of a democratic justice system. Soliman's family is being held in an immigration detention center in Texas. </p>

          <p>President Trump has initiated an investigation into the Biden administration's use of an autopen, a machine used to sign documents, claiming it was part of a conspiracy to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. Trump alleges that Biden's aides may have secretly used the autopen to sign key presidential documents, including pardons and federal judge appointments, which could have implications for the legality of those actions. Biden has refuted these claims, stating that he made all decisions during his presidency and that the allegations are a distraction. The investigation will examine which executive actions involved the autopen and who directed its use. </p>

          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The ruling sides with environmental groups challenging the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015. The court order will remain in effect until at least July 18, pending a full hearing on the matter. Environmental groups argue that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review or public input. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, spurred by concerns raised in a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Experts argue that the report's claims of harm to women are misguided and lack transparency. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review and has been used by millions of patients since then. </p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely.
