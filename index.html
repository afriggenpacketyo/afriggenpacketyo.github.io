          <p>The UK government is underwriting a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover to support the company and its supply chain following a prolonged production shutdown caused by a cyber-attack. The manufacturer, which employs around 30,000 people directly, has not built any cars this month, putting its suppliers at risk of financial collapse. This financial support, provided through the Export Development Guarantee, aims to protect thousands of jobs in the West Midlands and Merseyside while JLR works to recover from the hack and resume operations. The move marks a significant government intervention in response to a corporate cybersecurity incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new memoir by King Charles III's former butler, Grant Harrold, recounts Prince Philip's famously direct and often profane manner of speaking, which was a source of both fear and amusement among palace staff. The book describes an incident at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding where the late Duke of Edinburgh was overheard expressing relief that the ceremony was over. Harrold notes that while Philip's bluntness could be intimidating, many admired his authenticity and refusal to suffer fools gladly. Other anecdotes from royal experts corroborate his reputation for making unfiltered and sometimes controversial comments throughout his public life.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 06:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University in Nanjing have developed the world's first laboratory system to simulate the effects of a triple nuclear strike on a single, deeply buried target. The experiment aims to understand the impact of multiple warheads detonating in rapid succession, a scenario designed to overcome hardened underground defenses that conventional weapons cannot destroy. This development addresses a significant challenge in modern warfare concerning the elimination of highly protected strategic assets. The research provides new insights into the destructive potential of coordinated nuclear attacks on fortified structures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is exploring leasing a portion of Camp Pendleton for commercial development, a move that would be unprecedented for the 125,000-acre military base in Southern California. As the largest undeveloped stretch of coastline in the region, the base is a critical training ground and a vital ecological preserve for numerous endangered species. This consideration aligns with the Trump administration's push to use public lands for revenue generation, raising concerns among local officials and conservationists. Details about the potential development remain scarce, creating uncertainty about its impact on the local economy, environment, and military readiness.</p>

          <h2>Traditional Mexican Sweet 'Acitrón' Pushes Barrel Cactus Towards Extinction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The biznaga, a species of barrel cactus, is facing extinction in Mexico due to its use in a traditional candied sweet called acitrón, a key ingredient in dishes like chiles en nogada. Despite being illegal since the early 2000s, acitrón is still widely sold in markets due to high cultural demand. Biologists explain that the cactus grows extremely slowly, making it impossible to farm commercially and leading to its overexploitation in the wild.

          <p>In response to soaring housing costs, a growing number of Americans are teaming up with friends or relatives to buy homes, a practice known as co-buying. With home prices up 56% since 2020, pooling financial resources allows buyers to enter a market that is otherwise unaffordable, particularly for single individuals. This trend is more common among younger generations, who face a significant disadvantage compared to couples with dual incomes. While co-buying offers a path to homeownership and companionship, experts advise creating a formal legal agreement to navigate potential future complications like one party wanting to sell.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support for a permanent solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Congressional Republicans are deferring to President Trump to initiate negotiations. As the administration expands its mass deportation efforts, concerns are growing for the nearly half a million DACA recipients, some of whom have already been detained. While some Republican lawmakers, like Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, have introduced bills to provide a pathway to legal status, the broader party consensus is that no legislative action will proceed without a clear directive from the White House. This political stalemate leaves the future of DACA recipients in a state of continued uncertainty.</p>

Ahead of the vote, two pro-Russian parties were disqualified over findings of illegal financing, further heightening the political stakes.

          <p>Swiss citizens are voting in a second national referendum on whether to introduce an optional electronic identity system. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to concerns over data privacy and the involvement of private companies. The revised plan ensures the system will be managed entirely by the state, with personal data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes online, while opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements. Recent polls suggest that voters, now more familiar with digital credentials after the pandemic, may be ready to approve the measure.</p>

This long-running rivalry, which originated from a cocaine theft in 2001, has involved multiple murders and tit-for-tat attacks.

          <p>A neck injury to European player Viktor Hovland could bring the rarely used "envelope rule" into play on the final day of the Ryder Cup. Before the Sunday singles matches, each team captain secretly selects one player's name to place in a sealed envelope. If a player from the opposing team has to withdraw due to injury or illness, the player named in the envelope also sits out, and the match is declared a half-point tie for each side. This rule ensures that an injury does not unfairly penalize one team by forcing a healthy player to sit out without a match.</p>

Iran suspended inspections after Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities in June, though it insists its program is peaceful. This move represents a major blow to the already fragile nuclear accord, which was weakened when the U.S. withdrew in 2018, and further escalates tensions between Tehran and Western powers.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated the initiative will take lessons from the post-war housing boom, using development corporations with special planning powers to accelerate building. The plan aims to address the national housing crisis and stimulate economic growth, with a goal of making at least 40% of the new homes affordable.</p>

          <p>Russell M. Nelson, the 17th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has passed away at the age of 101. He was the oldest president in the church's history, having served since January 2018. Before his full-time church service, Nelson was an internationally renowned heart surgeon who pioneered the development of the heart-lung machine and performed Utah's first open-heart surgery. During his presidency, he emphasized the full name of the church to focus on Jesus Christ and announced the construction of over 100 new temples, significantly expanding the church's global presence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As companies rapidly adopt artificial intelligence, many are at risk of incurring "AI debt," a term for the future costs associated with poorly implemented autonomous tools. A recent survey found that 79% of companies expect to face this issue, which can manifest as security risks, poor data quality, wasted resources, and employee burnout from managing inefficient AI agents. Experts warn that without proper infrastructure, training, and clear use cases, the rush to integrate AI can lead to counterproductive outcomes, such as generating low-quality "workslop." Thoughtful piloting and strategic planning are recommended to avoid these long-term costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently bolster the Middle East's ambition to become a global technology hub. Gulf nations, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are actively courting top AI and tech talent with competitive compensation packages, tax incentives, and long-term "golden visas." As the U.S. potentially makes it more difficult for companies to hire foreign experts, these countries are positioning themselves as attractive alternatives with business-friendly environments. This policy shift could intensify the global competition for skilled professionals and reshape international tech landscapes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The reimposition of UN "snapback" sanctions is compounding the severe economic crisis in Iran, where citizens are facing soaring food prices and growing anxiety. The sanctions freeze Iranian assets, halt arms deals, and penalize its missile program, further straining an economy already crippled by a record-low currency. Staples like meat and rice are becoming unaffordable for many families, while fears of renewed military conflict with Israel and the U.S. persist. This economic pressure and geopolitical uncertainty are creating a challenging environment, with reports of increased repression and widespread public exhaustion.</p>

          <p>Despite having one of the tallest teams in the Premier League and hiring a new set-piece specialist, Newcastle United has struggled to convert dead-ball situations into goals this season. The team has scored only once from a corner or free-kick, a stark contrast to their upcoming opponent, Arsenal, who have scored half their league goals from set-pieces. Manager Eddie Howe has acknowledged that "something is not quite clicking" and has taken responsibility for improving performance in this area. The article explores the team's strategic shifts, including an increased use of long throws, as they work to leverage their physical advantages.</p>

The article challenges the framing of autism as a tragedy, instead celebrating the unique perspectives and strengths of autistic individuals.

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their roster for the upcoming wild-card series, with several key decisions hinging on player health and strategic matchups. Infielder Max Muncy and catcher Will Smith are still recovering from injuries, leaving their availability for Tuesday's opener uncertain. The team must also determine its pitching rotation and balance its bullpen, which currently has an abundance of left-handed relievers. Manager Dave Roberts indicated that players are competing for the final spots, with veterans like Kiké Hernández making a strong late-season case for inclusion on the postseason roster.</p>
