          <p>Police in downtown Los Angeles declared an "unlawful assembly" and used non-lethal rounds and tear gas to disperse "No Kings Day" demonstrators near the Metropolitan Detention Center. The protests, part of nationwide rallies against President Trump's policies, had been largely peaceful during the day, critiquing his stance on transgender rights, foreign policy, and immigration. Tensions escalated in the evening as law enforcement pressed crowds, with demonstrators accusing police of instigating the confrontation. Despite the use of force, no arrests were reported by 9 p.m., highlighting a localized clash within a broader protest movement.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's cherished trees are struggling against climate change and increasing extreme weather, leading Forestry England to release a "species for the future" list. This inventory highlights thirty tree species, including familiar names like oak and alder, alongside less common ones such as coast redwood and Corsican pine, expected to thrive in a warmer climate. The initiative aims to create more diverse and resilient woodlands, as rapid temperature rises driven by human activity outpace trees' natural adaptation abilities. This article underscores the urgent need for assisted migration and proactive conservation efforts to safeguard UK forests from acute oak decline and other climate-related stresses.</p>

          <p>China has gained a significant advantage in its trade relations, particularly with the West, through the "potassium railway" connecting to landlocked Laos. This railway has become a critical conduit for China to secure potassium, a strategic resource vital for agricultural production, in which China is severely scarce, holding less than 4% of global reserves. For decades, China relied heavily on North American potassium imports, but this new infrastructure provides unprecedented confidence in trade negotiations. This article highlights a geopolitical shift, where China's infrastructure investment strengthens its resource security and global bargaining power, diminishing North America's previous leverage.
