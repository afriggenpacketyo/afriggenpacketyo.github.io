          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, resulting in injuries to nineteen people, with four in serious condition.

Emergency services responded to the scene, and the bridge did not sustain any damage according to the mayor of New York. The Mexican Navy is investigating the incident, which occurred during a goodwill visit by the ship to New York City. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices for consumers. Trump suggested that Walmart, which made billions last year, should absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of passing them on to customers. Walmart responded that it would do its best to keep prices low, but cautioned that it could not absorb all the pressure imposed by the tariffs. The dispute highlights the tension between the administration's trade policies and the impact on retailers and consumers. </p>

          <p>In 1993, Jeanie Childs was found murdered in her Minneapolis high-rise apartment, stabbed over 60 times. The crime scene was exceptionally bloody, with bloody footprints left by the killer providing a key clue. Despite collecting DNA and comparing footprints to numerous suspects, the case remained unsolved for decades. In 2019, genetic genealogy linked Jerry Westrom to the crime scene, leading to his conviction in 2022, though questions remain about the presence of other DNA at the scene and the circumstances surrounding the evidence. </p>

          <p>A BBC reporter engaged with hackers claiming responsibility for cyber attacks on M&S and Co-op, who provided evidence of stolen customer and employee data. The hackers, linked to a cyber crime service called DragonForce, expressed frustration that Co-op wasn't meeting their ransom demands. DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services, including ransomware negotiation tools, in exchange for a cut of any ransoms collected. The group's darknet website was recently hacked by a rival gang, illustrating the power struggle within the ransomware ecosystem. </p>

          <p>Michael Gove, a former Conservative minister, stated that a second Scottish independence referendum could occur if the public demonstrates overwhelming support. This aligns with SNP leader John Swinney's desire to achieve "demonstrable support" for independence. While Gove doesn't believe another referendum is currently necessary, he warned against complacency. Both Gove and Swinney seem to agree that greater public support is needed for independence to move forward. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions, and has added new study requirements that could cost the company tens of millions. The agencyâ€™s new restrictions also appeared to reflect the high degree of skepticism about vaccines from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, and the other leaders he has appointed at health agencies. The new restriction will sharply limit access to the Novavax vaccine for people under 65 who are in good health, making it less likely that insurers would broadly cover the shots. This marks the first time the F.D.A. has included health criteria for Covid shots. </p>

          <p>A photographer has spent a decade capturing the diversity and beauty of Britain's back garden wildlife. The images, including battling birds and squabbling squirrels, showed just what could be found "under our noses", said Andrew Fusek Peters. Hundreds of his images feature in a new book. Mr Fusek Peters started concentrating on his own garden wildlife after a diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018, perfecting a technique to "make time stop" to get shots of birds and butterflies taking off and in mid flight. </p>

          <p>The deadliest attacks in several years caught civilians in the middle of a decades-long conflict between India and Pakistan. In April, a militant attack killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists. What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. A ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink. </p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that 81% of the population feels more uneasy than hopeful about former President Trump's second term. This sentiment is partly due to concerns about the impact of tariffs he has imposed. The survey also reveals that 47% of Japanese citizens believe Japan should emphasize ties with the United States, while 48% think relations with both the United States and China should remain at the same level. </p>
