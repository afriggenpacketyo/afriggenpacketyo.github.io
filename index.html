          <p>An Arizona woman received a 102-month prison sentence for her role in a major fraud scheme that helped North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at over 300 U.S. companies. Posing as American citizens using stolen identities, these workers generated more than $17 million for the North Korean government, which U.S. officials stated helps fund its nuclear weapons program. The woman, Christina Marie Chapman, pleaded guilty to charges including wire fraud and money laundering after being found to have managed laptops and finances for the operation.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient named Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez is facing deportation to El Salvador after he accidentally drove into Mexico from San Diego while working as a rideshare driver. U.S. authorities classified the incident as a "self-deportation" and arrested him for attempting to re-enter illegally. Now detained, Hernandez-Rodriguez, who has lived in the U.S. since age 14, is separated from his pregnant wife and faces expedited removal, highlighting the precarious status of DACA recipients under strict immigration enforcement policies. His attorney alleges border officials also attempted to solicit a bribe.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico, leading to road closures and the rescue of at least five individuals trapped by floodwaters. The mountain village is particularly vulnerable due to burn scars from past wildfires that have compromised the landscape's ability to absorb rain. This event follows massive flooding just three weeks prior that resulted in three fatalities and damaged hundreds of homes, compounding the challenges for the southern New Mexico community during its summer rainy season.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democratic figures, including Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom, are already signaling potential 2028 presidential ambitions through a series of media appearances on non-traditional platforms like popular podcasts. This strategy reflects a perceived need for the party to reach a broader audience beyond established news outlets, a tactic successfully used by Donald Trump. These early moves also involve a rhetorical shift towards more centrist positions on cultural issues, suggesting a course correction after the party's 2024 election loss.</p>

Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure, Cramer argues the spending is necessary to develop the most accurate and profitable AI models, which could eventually become near-monopolies.

It explains that grand jury testimony is legally protected and rarely unsealed, requiring a judge to find an exceptional public interest. Furthermore, the FBI generally does not release investigative material unrelated to criminal charges to protect privacy and ongoing probes. Therefore, even if the administration had wanted to release the documents, it faced significant legal and procedural hurdles to do so.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a settlement with the Trump administration, paying over $200 million and making other concessions to restore hundreds of millions in federal research funding. The administration had frozen the funds in March, accusing the university of permitting antisemitism on campus amid pro-Palestinian protests. This action is part of a broader pattern of the administration targeting universities, corporations, and law firms. The deal resolves Columbia's immediate crisis but signals a continued, aggressive approach by the administration toward institutions it perceives as oppositional.</p>

          <p>Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer at the tech company Astronomer, has resigned from her position. Her departure follows the resignation of the company's CEO, Andy Byron, last week. The resignations were prompted by a viral video from a Coldplay concert that appeared to show the two executives embracing before hiding from the arena's large screen camera. The clip sparked widespread online speculation and media attention, leading the company to place Byron on leave and launch an internal investigation before both executives ultimately left the firm.</p>

This synthetic crystal can convert laser beams to frequencies that travel long distances through the atmosphere with minimal power loss. The material is also reported to withstand exceptionally high laser power, potentially overcoming a long-standing obstacle where lasers damage their own components. This breakthrough could enable the development of ground-based lasers capable of targeting satellites in orbit.</p>
