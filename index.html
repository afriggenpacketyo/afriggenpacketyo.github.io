          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, primarily South Korean citizens, for allegedly violating visitor visa terms. Officials stated the action was necessary to protect American jobs, while South Korea has called for its citizens' rights to be respected. The detained individuals, who were not directly employed by Hyundai, were found to be working illegally, sparking a debate over the rules and enforcement of the visa waiver program and its use by international companies operating in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A recent summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation underscored a potential shift in the global order but notably lacked a foundational economic agreement akin to the historic Bretton Woods system. The article argues that for the SCO's political and strategic goals to be realized, a new multilateral monetary and economic framework is essential to prevent further global fragmentation into competing blocs. With 27 members and partners, including China, Russia, and India, the SCO has the potential to lead such an initiative, but the task requires immense effort from both Eastern and Western powers to succeed.</p>

          <p>Approximately 100 firefighters responded to a significant blaze at a restaurant located in the BBC's former headquarters in White City, west London. The fire, which started in the early hours, affected the nine-storey building that now contains flats, studios, and commercial spaces, leading to the evacuation of residents as a precaution. While there were no reported casualties, the incident caused considerable disruption, with emergency services setting up a rest center for those displaced from their homes and closing nearby roads for an extended period.</p>

With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the imperial family faces a potential crisis, prompting a national debate over whether to allow female succession or re-integrate distant male relatives into the royal line.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, but the occasion is shadowed by political attacks from Germany's far-right AfD party. The AfD has criticized the movement for promoting "globalist uniformity," echoing the "degenerate art" rhetoric used by the Nazis who shut the school down in 1933. Despite these challenges, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its centennial program, focusing on the evolution of materials and sustainable design while forming alliances to counter the rising far-right cultural pressure.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington D.C. to address crime has ignited a fierce political debate between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have criticized the move as an overreach and embarrassing on the world stage, especially since the mayor did not request the troops. Conversely, Republicans argue the presence of the Guard has made the city safer, questioning why their opponents do not prioritize security. The clash continues as the D.C. Attorney General sues the administration in an effort to have the troops removed from the city.</p>

          <p>China's recent push to combat "involution," or destructive internal price competition, is unlikely to lead to the large-scale supply-side reforms seen in 2015, according to an analysis by Oxford Economics. The research firm suggests that while President Xi Jinping has criticized low-quality competition, the current economic environment makes it difficult to implement significant production capacity cuts or meaningful demand-side stimulus. This contrasts with the decisive actions taken nearly a decade ago, indicating that resolving China's supply-demand imbalances may be a more challenging and less direct process this time.

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's punitive tariffs on India represent a significant breakdown in the bilateral relationship, forcing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to re-evaluate his foreign policy. The author suggests that this move is not just a whim but a sign of a broader trend where Western nations are retreating from the post-war global order they created. For India, this signals that it cannot fully align with the West and must return to a form of non-alignment or "strategic autonomy" to navigate an increasingly protectionist and hostile world.</p>

          <p>France is facing a political and economic crisis as its government lacks the majority to pass necessary budget cuts, raising fears about the stability of the eurozone. With national debt at approximately €3.35 trillion (113% of GDP) and the largest budget deficit in the EU, financial markets are growing increasingly nervous about the country's fiscal health. Economists warn that if the finances of the eurozone's second-largest economy spiral out of control, it could pose a significant risk to the euro, though a short-term crisis is not yet expected.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The resignation of senior minister Angela Rayner has plunged the UK's Labour government into turmoil, prompting Prime Minister Keir Starmer to conduct a major cabinet reshuffle. The move is seen as an attempt to restore order and counter the government's sharp decline in opinion polls amid the rise of the rival Reform UK party. British newspapers are describing the situation as a "meltdown" and a "nightmare on Downing Street," questioning whether the reshuffle will be enough to improve the government's performance and regain public trust.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech describing President Donald Trump as a maverick "risk taker" who correctly identified the anxieties of Western societies. In a move seen as both a diplomatic effort to steady the "special relationship" and a political maneuver, Mandelson will draw parallels between the mandates of Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The speech comes as the UK's Labour government faces increasing political pressure from the Trump-aligned Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal report claiming Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to announce a link between Tylenol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism has been labeled "speculation" by the Department of Health and Human Services. Tylenol's maker, Kenvue, maintains there is no causal link, a position supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Medical experts note that research on the topic has been conflicting and inconclusive, as it is difficult to separate the medication's effect from the underlying condition it was used to treat.</p>

This channel, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, operates alongside traditional state-level foreign relations to build connections and influence. While not aimed at creating a global communist movement like the Soviet Union, these interactions are an important part of China's diplomatic outreach, particularly with ideologically aligned countries and parties around the world, strengthening its international network.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, named the Pyrite fire, broke out Friday evening near Jurupa Valley in California's Inland Empire, quickly growing to 200 acres. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuation orders for the nearby communities of Jurupa Hills and Sunnyslope as it burned through light, dry fuels. Nearly 300 firefighting personnel, supported by helicopters and water tenders, were deployed to combat the flames, and an evacuation center was established at a local high school for displaced residents as the fire threatened the San Bernardino County border.</p>
