          <p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the nation's leading independent rights group, has reported facing an unprecedented government crackdown, including having its offices sealed, bank accounts frozen, and events obstructed. Officials claim these actions impede their ability to advocate for civil liberties, while the government denies the pressure, citing national security concerns as the reason for increased restrictions. This situation unfolds against a backdrop of what critics, including Amnesty International, describe as a shrinking space for human rights and rising authoritarianism in Pakistan, with a notable decline in the country's democracy ranking.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for the establishment of a global center to coordinate artificial intelligence governance, aiming to create a unified framework and reverse what he termed a "fragmented trend." The proposal was made at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai as China seeks to expand its influence in the rapidly evolving sector. This initiative comes shortly after the United States announced its own AI policy blueprint designed to bolster American dominance, highlighting the intensifying technological competition between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>This article highlights several often-overlooked unsanitary spots in hotel rooms, according to health and travel experts. Areas like decorative pillows, TV remotes, and ice buckets are cited as frequently uncleaned and teeming with germs, with some studies finding more bacteria than is permissible in hospitals. Experts advise travelers to be cautious, suggesting they disinfect high-touch surfaces, avoid using certain items like unlined ice buckets, and report any cleanliness issues to staff immediately upon arrival.</p>

          <p>China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, has published a series of commentaries urging the army's political officers to improve their public image and reputation. The guidelines emphasize demonstrating unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, acting with honesty, and ensuring integrity in the promotion process for soldiers. Observers interpret these directives as a subtle acknowledgment of recent corruption and misconduct among high-ranking generals, reflecting Beijing's effort to reinforce political control and repair damage within the People's Liberation Army.</p>

This high-stakes discussion occurs amid growing optimism for a deal, partly influenced by a recent U.S.-Japan agreement that established a similar tariff baseline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank, California, executed a dramatic dive, dropping 300 feet in just 36 seconds, to avoid another aircraft shortly after takeoff. The sudden maneuver caused panic among passengers, some of whom were thrown from their seats, and resulted in injuries to two cabin crew members. The nearby aircraft was identified as a Hawker Hunter fighter jet, and the incident is now under investigation by the FAA amid growing concerns over aviation safety in the US.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, was questioned for a day and a half by the U.S. Justice Department. Her lawyer stated she answered questions truthfully about numerous individuals, although no offer of clemency was made in exchange for her cooperation. The questioning occurs as President Trump's past association with Epstein faces renewed scrutiny, though Trump has denied any wrongdoing and stated he has not considered pardoning Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunis, Tunisia, to denounce what they call President Kais Saied's authoritarian rule, four years after he dissolved parliament and seized broad powers. Chanting for "the fall of the regime," demonstrators criticized the jailing of opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, which they claim has turned the country into an "open-air prison." The protest highlights the deep political divisions and growing public discontent over the erosion of democratic institutions since Saied's controversial actions in 2021.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing over 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a government-wide deferred resignation program. This potential exodus would shrink NASA's civil servant staff from approximately 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. The departures come amid a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and a recent leadership crisis, raising concerns about the agency's ability to maintain safety and pursue its ambitious exploration goals.
