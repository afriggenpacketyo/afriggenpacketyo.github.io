          <p>Vance Boelter faces multiple charges, including murder, after allegedly attacking several Minnesota lawmakers. According to the FBI, Boelter went to the homes of four lawmakers, killing Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. The attacks appear to be politically motivated, with Boelter sending a text message to his family stating, "Dad went to war last night." Boelter is currently in custody and is being held without bail. The FBI alleges that Boelter stalked his targets and meticulously planned his attacks, researching the victims and conducting surveillance on them. The community is reeling from the violence, with officials condemning the acts as political assassinations and calling for unity and an end to political violence. </p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to remove all members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has caused widespread concern among doctors and scientists. Kennedy appointed new members, including those critical of vaccines and the Covid-19 response, and revised Covid-19 vaccine guidance, limiting shots to specific groups. These actions undermine the CDC's authority and raise questions about the trustworthiness of future vaccine recommendations. Experts urge patients and providers to consult professional medical societies for vaccine guidance, emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making in light of these changes.

Experts suggest that while some debt can be considered "good debt" if it brings a return on investment, careful planning is crucial.

Regardless of the chosen method, it is essential to create a repayment plan that aligns with the couple's financial goals to avoid long-term financial strain. The experts emphasize that a wedding is just one day, but a marriage is a lifelong commitment, and financial stability is vital for a successful partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Barry Glazer, a Baltimore lawyer and real estate firm co-owner, is suing Meta and Google over social-media-based networks that facilitate unauthorized access to vacant properties. The lawsuit alleges that these "squatter" networks, found on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, offer keys and tours of illegally accessed properties, increasing liability and maintenance costs for real estate companies. Glazer argues that the tech giants' failure to enforce their policies against fraudulent conduct has made properties vulnerable to hijacking. Local leaders have vowed to hold those involved in the "squatter house" trend accountable, with Baltimore prosecutors considering criminal charges.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering expanding the travel ban to include up to 36 additional countries, according to a State Department memo. The memo demands that diplomats in these countries detail how they will address U.S. concerns regarding vetting and screening information. Concerns include state sponsorship of terror, involvement in acts of terrorism, unreliable identity documents, widespread government fraud, high visa overstay rates, and involvement in antisemitic or Anti-American activity. Countries that fail to address these concerns could face a travel ban as early as August. Critics have previously condemned Trump's travel bans as discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Israel struck Iranian state television and warned residents of Tehran to evacuate after accusing Iran of targeting civilians. The strike followed another wave of Iranian missile attacks on Israel, resulting in casualties. Israel's warning affected approximately 330,000 people in central Tehran, including areas with state TV, police headquarters, and hospitals. Iranian state television went off the air after an explosion, and reports indicated that the network's headquarters were on fire. The conflict has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks and heightened tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his plan to expand deportations in major U.S. cities, specifically targeting those run by Democrats. He stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Trump accused Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the welfare state. He expressed his support for ICE, FBI, DEA, ATF, the Patriots at Pentagon, and the State Department in carrying out this plan. The comments follow protests against the administration's immigration policies and a recent shift in stance regarding undocumented workers in the farming and hospitality industries.</p>
