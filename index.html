In contrast, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines as momentum leaders from earlier in the year lost steam. Concurrently, reporting indicates that chipmaker Nvidia is developing a new, more advanced AI processor specifically for the Chinese market, aiming to navigate U.S. export regulations. This development comes as Nvidia seeks to maintain its competitive edge in a key international market while adhering to governmental controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, citing a range of legal violations and overstays by foreign students. The majority of revocations were reportedly for offenses such as assault, DUI, and burglary, while a smaller number, between 200 and 300, were related to accusations of "support for terrorism." This action represents a small fraction of the 1.1 million foreign students in the U.S. but reflects the Trump administration's stricter enforcement of immigration laws and increased screening measures, including the review of social media profiles for visa applicants.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's government has stated its intention to impose reciprocal visa requirements on United States citizens, mirroring a new U.S. rule that demands Nigerian applicants disclose their social media history. The U.S. Mission in Nigeria recently mandated that visa applicants provide all social media handles, email addresses, and phone numbers used in the last five years. In response, a Nigerian Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that the country would adopt the same measures for Americans applying for Nigerian visas, citing the principle of reciprocity in international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska demonstrated a lack of a coherent foreign policy doctrine, instead showcasing chaos and personal deference. The author contends that European allies' efforts to establish a unified Western position on Ukraine were undermined by Trump's actions, which included offering Putin significant economic concessions. The piece criticizes Trump's negotiator for alleged blunders and portrays the administration's diplomatic team as incompetent and disunited. It concludes that Trump's approach is driven by self-aggrandizement rather than strategic diplomacy, aiming to create a kleptocratic system similar to Putin's.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, stating that it expects "meaningful" revenue from President Trump's tariffs to largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The rating agency noted that the new law is projected to increase the federal deficit but believes the tariff income will provide a counterbalance. However, S&P issued a warning that the rating could be lowered in the next few years if deficits increase due to political inability to control spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions like the Federal Reserve.

The Home Office had argued against the move, warning it could impact its ability to house asylum seekers nationwide. The council leader cited an "intolerable strain" on the community and the risk of "irreparable harm" as reasons for pursuing legal action.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose approximately 4% after the company maintained its full-year financial outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The home improvement giant anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year. While the company noted a "deferral mindset" from homeowners on large projects due to economic uncertainty, it also saw encouraging signs, such as a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends each month of the quarter. This performance suggests resilience in its business, particularly with professional contractors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kentucky's governor has enacted an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax." The action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, making its sale and possession illegal. This state-level ban comes as Kentucky's attorney general leads a coalition of 21 states urging the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to issue a nationwide emergency ban. The unregulated drug, which has never been approved for medical use, was linked to nearly 50 fatal overdoses in Kentucky last year alone.</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old mother of four from Utah, Amanda Anderson, initially dismissed a small spot on her nose as dry skin but was later diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma. After a gut feeling prompted a second opinion and a biopsy, she underwent Mohs surgery to remove the cancerous cells, which left a hole the size of a quarter on her nose. Anderson has since documented her experience on social media to raise awareness about skin cancer and the importance of using sunscreen. She is now cancer-free but will require check-ups every six months, and she urges others to be vigilant about skin health.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Spain are continuing to combat several major wildfires, particularly in the northwestern Galicia region, during one of the country's worst fire seasons in decades. Although a recent heat wave has subsided, the fire risk remains extremely high in the parched woodlands. The fires have killed four people and burned over 1,475 square miles of land this year. Officials attribute the crisis to a combination of climate change, which is making heat and dryness more frequent, and land management issues in depopulated rural areas.</p>

          <p>Sales of Tesla's Cybertruck are proving to be a fraction of the more than one million reservations the company held before its launch, with just over 52,000 units sold in the U.S. so far. Analysts suggest the vehicle's futuristic and unconventional design, while attention-grabbing, has limited appeal for traditional truck buyers who prioritize functionality. Production issues, numerous recalls, and specifications that fell short of early promises—including towing capacity and battery range—have also contributed to the disappointing sales figures. The vehicle appears to appeal more to EV enthusiasts than to the core truck market.</p>

The expansion is in preparation for the upcoming iPhone 17 models and is part of Apple's broader strategy to diversify its manufacturing base away from China. This development coincides with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's confirmation of planned tariff hikes on India for "profiteering" from discounted Russian oil.
