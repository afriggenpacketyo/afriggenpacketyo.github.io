          <p>Following a mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, all 14 injured children are expected to survive, with some already discharged from the hospital. The incident occurred during a Catholic Mass, marking the start of the school year, where a shooter opened fire, tragically killing two children. Police identified the shooter as 23-year-old Robin Westman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Authorities recovered three legally purchased guns and are investigating a potential motive, believing the attack was premeditated, while additional police patrols are planned for schools in the area. (not investment advice) The tone of the article reflects the relief that the victims are expected to survive after such a terrible event.</p>

Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched a combined 598 drones and 31 missiles, with the air force claiming to have shot down a large portion of them. The strikes caused damage to buildings across multiple city districts, including residential and educational facilities. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks and called for stronger international sanctions against Russia, while the EU confirmed damage to its mission building in Kyiv.

After the shooting, the children waited in the gym before being reunited with their parents, and Halsne expressed gratitude and prayers for his injured friend. The shooting prompted a large law enforcement response, and community leaders have expressed grief and outrage over the incident.</p>

The parade will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, highlighting a trilateral alignment among Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang. Analysts suggest that Kim's attendance signifies solidarity with pro-Russia and pro-China countries, while potentially signaling interest in resuming diplomacy with Trump. The gathering underscores the complex geopolitical dynamics and shifting alliances in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to the tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, potentially easing the controversial requirements introduced in 2023. The current rules mandate that properties must be available for 252 days and let out for 182 days annually to qualify for non-domestic rates, which is now proposed to change to an average of 182 days let over several years. While some industry groups criticize the proposals as insufficient, others express concern about the potential impact on the housing crisis. A consultation is open until November 20, with changes potentially taking effect on April 1, 2026.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two young children and injuries to 17 others, including 14 children. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, opened fire from outside the building, targeting children and worshippers, and later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement executed multiple search warrants and are reviewing videos posted by the shooter, who had no extensive criminal history. Community leaders and officials have expressed grief and are providing support, while the FBI is investigating the shooting as a potential act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>
