          <h2>China Denies Trade Talks Amid Tariff War with the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims from U.S. President Donald Trump and his aides, China has denied engaging in any trade negotiations with the United States to resolve the ongoing tariff war. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun clarified that no consultations or negotiations on tariffs are underway between the two countries, contradicting Trump's statements about communication with President Xi Jinping. This denial aligns with Beijing's firm opposition to Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, while American business owners and analysts express concerns about the potential economic repercussions of the trade conflict, including higher prices and product shortages. Optimism is low as the trade war continues to escalate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following reports that the prestigious legal journal was allegedly selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. These investigations, initiated by the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services, are in response to concerns about discriminatory practices at the Law Review. The investigations come amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Harvard over demands for the university to dismantle its DEI programs and scrutinize international students for ideological red flags. The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard due to antisemitism concerns and other issues. </p>

          <p>Negotiations in Cairo aimed at achieving a ceasefire in Gaza have reportedly made a "significant breakthrough," according to Egyptian security sources.

Egyptian intelligence chief General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad is scheduled to meet with an Israeli delegation headed by strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer in Cairo to continue the talks. Hamas has consistently stated its unwillingness to disarm, which is a key demand for Israel, while discussions continue between Egyptian and Israeli delegations. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have achieved a significant breakthrough in producing advanced chips by developing an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source platform that meets international standards. The team, led by Lin Nan, a former head scientist at ASML, overcame a major hurdle in China's quest for home-grown chip production. ASML, the sole manufacturer of EUV machines, has been restricted from selling its most advanced models to China since 2019 due to U.S. pressure. Lin's return to China in 2021 and subsequent research efforts have enabled this critical advancement in photolithography technology.</p>

          <p>Premiership Rugby is considering a revamp that could be implemented as early as next season, focusing on financial sustainability, fanbase, and stadium criteria for qualification, rather than solely on-field performance. This potential change, requiring RFU Council approval, aims to expand the league while ensuring clubs meet certain standards, potentially allowing a resurrected Worcester Warriors to return. TNT Sport is reportedly close to finalizing a five-year extension to their television rights agreement, indicating positive momentum despite financial pressures and underperformance in European competition. The Premiership is keen to expand, with Ealing, Coventry, and Doncaster all having applied to be assessed against the Premiership's standards this season.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies have caused significant economic disruption, making it challenging to reverse the effects.

The changes have been substantial, and while the world is still adapting, there's uncertainty about whether a future president could easily undo the Trump administration's actions. The dismantling of governmental infrastructure, along with the economic shifts, poses a challenge for future administrations seeking to restore the previous economic landscape.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending the sugar tax, known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to include milkshakes and other milk-based drinks.

The Treasury also plans to lower the maximum sugar allowance in drinks subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. While the exemption for milk-based drinks was initially included due to concerns about calcium consumption, the government now believes the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar. </p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to charge migrants $1,000 to claim asylum, a new fee intended to curb immigration and fund the Trump administration's border security efforts. This fee would be the first of its kind in the United States, targeting individuals seeking protection based on persecution fears. The bill also includes a $1,000 fee for most immigrants paroled into the U.S. and a $3,500 fee for those sponsoring children, potentially hindering the reunification of unaccompanied minors with family members in the country. These proposals are part of a broader legislative effort to implement President Trump's domestic agenda.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggests that a college education may not always be worth the money, as tuition costs rise and student loan debt burdens many Americans. While college graduates typically earn more than those with only a high school diploma, a significant percentage of graduates do not see a substantial return on their investment. Factors such as high out-of-pocket expenses, living on campus, and taking longer to graduate can reduce the value of a college degree. A student's choice of major also plays a crucial role, with STEM fields generally leading to higher incomes. (not investment advice)</p>

Manfred said reinstating Rose is "a little more complicated than it might appear on the outside" and did not commit to a specific timeline.
