          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 20th home run of the season in the Dodgers' 9-5 victory over the Cleveland Guardians. Ohtani's two-run shot extended the Dodgers' lead in the fourth inning, marking his fastest time to reach 20 home runs in his major league career. Max Muncy also contributed with a three-run homer in the ninth, while Dustin May earned the win for the Dodgers. The Dodgers secured the first two games of the series, setting the stage for a potential sweep. The team's performance embodied a dynamic mix of strong offense and areas needing improvement, with notable contributions from Muncy and Michael Conforto, who had been underperforming.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, experienced an uncontrolled reentry after mission control lost contact with the upper stage during its ninth uncrewed test flight. The rocket leaked fuel, spun out of control, and likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, according to officials. SpaceX confirmed that Starship suffered from "a rapid unscheduled disassembly," attributing the loss of control to a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage. Despite the failure, SpaceX emphasized that the test flight would provide valuable data to improve Starship's reliability, with the ultimate goal of making life multiplanetary. This test will help SpaceX improve Starship's reliability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment, contributing significantly to the rise in the national unemployment rate. The unemployment rate among recent college grads aged 22-27 is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average, which is an unusual trend. The report attributes this rise to a mismatch between the oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech sector. Economic uncertainty and the potential impact of automation and AI are also contributing factors, leading to a softening in overall demand for recent graduates. This is leading to college-educated workers finding themselves in roles where a bachelor's degree or higher is not typically required.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has allowed prosecutors to downgrade the charges against L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of using excessive force against an unarmed woman. The decision comes after U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, a Trump appointee, sought a misdemeanor plea deal for Kirk, leading to resignations from several federal prosecutors. While the judge rejected the proposed probation sentence, he granted the motion to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, meaning Kirk could still face jail time. The case has sparked controversy and raised questions about prosecutorial discretion and political influence within the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will no longer advise routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The decision is a departure from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone over 6 months old, citing a lack of data to support the need for shots in healthy children. While most children experience mild symptoms from COVID-19, some can become seriously ill or develop long COVID. The original vaccination course offered significant protection against serious illness, but the need for annual vaccines is more contentious, with debates over the duration of protection and the benefits for children with prior infections or vaccinations.</p>

He stated that without adequate investment, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing or progress in halving knife crime and violence against women and girls. The Home Office has responded by stating that it is backing the police with increased funding, but forces are warning that existing funding levels are causing them to make cuts to existing officers.</p>

          <p>Leo Terrell, a Justice Department official leading President Trump's efforts against Harvard University, stated that the administration intends to sue the University of California system over alleged antisemitism. Terrell, who heads a multiagency task force on combating antisemitism, said that there will be "massive lawsuits" against the UC system and other colleges. The task force has identified UCLA, USC, and UC Berkeley, among others, for investigations, alleging that these campuses have rebuffed investigators. UC has stated that it abhors antisemitism and is cooperating with the administration.</p>

          <p>At least five people were injured in a shooting at the Brass Mill Center mall in Waterbury, Connecticut, on Tuesday afternoon. The incident began as a "conflict" between two individuals before one person opened fire, causing shoppers to flee and seek shelter. Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo said that the shooting was not believed to be a random act of violence, and the gunman is still at large. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont called the incident a "tragic mass shooting" and expressed gratitude to law enforcement for their swift response.</p>

The bill also aims to incentivize other states to establish their own versions of fire camps and expand occupational safety coverage for incarcerated firefighters.

Musk, who recently stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stated that the bill increases the budget deficit and undermines the work of the DOGE team. The bill includes extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increased border security spending, and changes to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits.

This move comes amid the administration's ongoing conflict with some of America's elite colleges, which Trump believes are too left-wing and have enabled antisemitism.

Experts attribute this decline to factors such as high housing and childcare costs, lack of paid parental leave, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
