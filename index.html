          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B in a $24 million civil lawsuit brought by a security guard who accused her of assault in 2018. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, alleged the incident occurred outside the artist's obstetrician's office and resulted in physical and emotional harm. Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, maintained that the guard was invasive and had filmed her against her wishes. The jury sided with the rapper, who will not have to pay any damages, concluding a trial that drew attention for her candid testimony.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has filed a lawsuit to block an Illinois law that grants state financial aid and in-state tuition rates to undocumented immigrant students. The federal government argues the law is discriminatory, claiming it violates federal statutes by providing residency-based benefits to non-citizens that are not available to U.S. citizens from other states. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker's office defended the law, stating it provides equitable educational opportunities and is consistent with federal law, framing the lawsuit as a politically motivated attack.</p>

          <p>A unique UK charity, the Safer Living Foundation, has been forced to close after 11 years despite its success in reducing reoffending rates among convicted sex offenders. The foundation provided a supportive environment to help individuals reintegrate into society, reporting a recidivism rate of just 2% compared to the national average of over 15%. The closure highlights the societal and financial challenges of funding rehabilitation programs for sex offenders, raising difficult questions about the most effective strategies for preventing future victimization and protecting the public.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled on the remedies in the landmark antitrust case against Google, declining to force the company to sell its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The decision, which was seen as avoiding the most severe potential penalties, caused Alphabet's stock to surge by 8% in after-hours trading. While Google must now share some search data with rivals and is barred from certain exclusive distribution contracts, the ruling allows the company to continue its lucrative default search engine deals, such as its multi-billion dollar agreement with Apple.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police forces and councils across the UK are issuing new warnings about a rise in sophisticated parking fine scams. Fraudsters are using tactics like fake text messages with malicious links and physical skimming devices attached to payment machines to steal financial information. To protect themselves, consumers should verify that any fine notice includes their vehicle registration, the time, and the location of the offense. Experts also advise against clicking unsolicited links and recommend physically inspecting payment machines for any signs of tampering before use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to take action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursors. The legislation is designed to hold accountable both government figures and manufacturers in China who do not implement credible measures, such as 'know-your-customer' procedures, to prevent the flow of these synthetic opioids. While the bill received support from both parties, some lawmakers emphasized that sanctions alone are insufficient and must be paired with effective diplomacy and international law enforcement cooperation.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Advanced Weapon Systems Absent from China's Military Parade</h2>

          <p>While China's upcoming military parade will showcase a wide array of its modern weaponry, some of the People's Liberation Army's most advanced and potent systems will not be on display. Key assets, such as the next-generation J-36 and J-50 stealth fighter jets, remain under development and are too sensitive for public viewing at this stage. This selective presentation allows China to demonstrate its significant military progress while keeping its most cutting-edge, strategic capabilities concealed, highlighting the rapid but secretive nature of its ambitious modernization program.</p>

          <h2>Retired Command Sergeant Major Expresses Alarm Over Military Patrols in U.S. Cities</h2>

          <p>A recently retired U.S. Army command sergeant major with combat experience in the Middle East has written an opinion piece expressing deep concern over the deployment of armed National Guard soldiers on the streets of Washington, D.C. He argues that using young, combat-trained soldiers for domestic policing is a dangerous misuse of the military, risking an erosion of trust between civilians and the armed forces. Drawing parallels to the fragile situations he witnessed abroad, he warns that normalizing a military presence in civilian spaces undermines the principles of American democracy.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, the lawyer for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has forcefully stated that his client 'did not ever commit mortgage fraud,' countering the allegations used by President Trump as grounds for her termination. The filing argues that the information on her mortgage applications, which Trump claims is cause for removal, was provided to the White House and Senate during her confirmation process and therefore cannot be a legitimate basis for her firing now. The lawyer contends the move is a pretext for Trump's true goal of pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. experiences a late-summer rise in COVID-19 cases, data indicates that the highest test positivity rates are currently concentrated in the West and South Central regions. States including Texas, California, Oregon, and New Mexico are seeing particularly high levels of transmission, driven by new variants and increased travel. While tracking data is less robust than in previous years, health officials urge residents in these areas to be extra cautious, recommending masking in crowded indoor spaces and testing for any cold-like symptoms to prevent further spread.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration intends to urgently appeal to the Supreme Court to uphold the legality of his tariffs. He stressed the need for a swift decision, warning of 'devastation for our country' if the tariffs are overturned, which he claims would require refunding trillions of dollars to other nations. The administration has justified the tariffs, which have generated significant federal revenue, as necessary measures to address national emergencies like trade deficits and fentanyl trafficking, arguing they are crucial for protecting domestic investments.

          <p>President Trump announced that the headquarters for U.S. Space Command will be moved from its temporary location in Colorado to Huntsville, Alabama. The decision reverses a Biden administration plan to keep the facility in Colorado, with Trump citing that Alabama 'fought harder for it' and criticizing Colorado's mail-in voting system. The move is expected to bring thousands of jobs and significant investment to Huntsville, which is already a major hub for Army and NASA space operations, and was praised by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville.</p>

          <p>The annual Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert concluded an unusually eventful year that included a homicide investigation, an unexpected childbirth, and a major dust storm. Authorities are investigating the death of a man found at a campsite, while in a separate incident, a woman who was unaware she was pregnant gave birth to a baby girl with the help of other festival-goers. The event began with a severe dust storm that damaged installations and temporarily closed the gates, adding to the chaotic and memorable nature of this year's gathering.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16 in England. The new law would apply to all retail outlets, including shops, cafes, and online stores, targeting popular brands like Red Bull and Monster. Citing concerns from parents and teachers about the health impacts of these drinks, which can contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee, officials aim to protect young people from issues like headaches, sleep problems, and abnormal heart rhythms linked to excessive consumption.</p>
