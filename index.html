            <p>The UK economy experienced a significant boost in February, growing by 0.5%, exceeding analysts' projections of 0.1%. This growth was primarily driven by a 0.3% expansion in the services sector, along with notable recoveries in production and construction output. The positive data led to a jump in the British pound against the dollar, reflecting increased investor confidence. This economic momentum is crucial as the UK prepares for the potential impact of new tariffs on exports to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists believe China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its yuan to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs due to concerns about triggering financial market instability and capital outflows. While the yuan recently weakened, analysts expect the central bank to manage a gradual depreciation. Rapid devaluation could weaken consumer confidence and lead to capital flight, complicating efforts to address China's slowing economy. Maintaining stability in the yuan's value is seen as crucial for Beijing's economic strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>'Wolf of Wall Street' Jordan Belfort said there's "no way" Donald Trump is guilty of insider trading or market manipulation after Trump said it was a "great time to buy" shares before a market surge. Belfort argues Trump's statement was public, not a tip to a few. Despite the mid-week surge, turbulence in stock markets appears far from over. Belfort said President Trump's dramatic intervention was necessary as the US has an "insane" trade imbalance. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. The Trump administration has conceded that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error", but appealed against a district court's order to "facilitate and effectuate" his return to the US. The case will now return to the trial court. The justices did not give the administration a deadline for when Mr Garcia should be returned.</p>
