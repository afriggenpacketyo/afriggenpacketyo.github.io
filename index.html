          <p>Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez, have been arrested and charged with accepting bribes to allow undocumented immigrants into the country.

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Government attorneys argue that the judge lacked the authority to compel the executive branch to engage with a foreign power. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was deported despite a previous ruling protecting him from deportation. The White House maintains that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, while his attorneys deny this claim.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the U.S. embassy in Ukraine for its "surprisingly disappointing" response to a Russian strike on Kryvyi Rih. Zelensky accused the embassy of being afraid to mention Russia in its condemnation of the attack. The strike, which killed at least 19 people, has drawn condemnation from European leaders. The U.S. has been pushing for a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia since President Trump came back to office.</p>
