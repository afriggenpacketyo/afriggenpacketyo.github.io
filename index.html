          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in April and March. This surge has prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate the cost of this staple food. Japan's core inflation rate also climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest level since January 2023, with rice significantly contributing to this inflation. Experts suggest that government measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending if extended to processed foods and restaurant prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's secure nuclear site, viewing it as a necessary measure due to the risk of rapid weapons production. While he approved attack plans, Trump is holding off on a final decision, hoping Iran will abandon its nuclear program. Diplomatic efforts are underway, with the U.K. Foreign Secretary meeting with U.S. officials and other foreign ministers planning to meet with Iranian officials in Geneva. Trump is aware of intelligence reports estimating Iran's potential bomb production speed, but the intelligence community maintains that no order to weaponize has been given.</p>

Proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service could also force the closure of the Till monument, which commemorates the story of Emmett Till and the civil rights movement.

The funds will be distributed based on outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing the completion of construction, clearing obligations, and reducing fiscal risk.

The ruling sided with 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge deemed the policy arbitrary and lacking specificity, emphasizing that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds.

          <p>Maternity services at two Leeds hospitals have been downgraded from "good" to "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) due to significant risks to women and babies. The CQC's unannounced inspections substantiated concerns from staff and patients regarding the quality of care and staffing levels. Deficiencies were found in risk management, safe environment, learning from incidents, infection prevention, medicines management, and staffing. The trust is required to take immediate action to improve, with the CQC monitoring services closely and the families affected urging for an independent review of the services.</p>

The expert notes that multiple strikes would be needed to damage the facility, and even then, Iran has the knowledge, experience, and resources to resume its nuclear program elsewhere. Continued military strikes are not considered a viable solution for achieving a nuclear-free Iran.</p>
