          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations are suing the Trump administration over an executive order that cuts federal funding to what the president deems "biased media." The lawsuit argues the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech, targeting NPR for its news coverage. Experts believe NPR has a strong case, as the administration's rationale for defunding NPR and PBS has been described as "leftwing propaganda." NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, asserts the lawsuit is a matter of necessity and principle, defending the rights flowing from the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>Some Social Security beneficiaries may see reduced checks starting in June as student loan garnishments resume after a long pause. The Trump administration announced the resumption of collection activity on defaulted student loans, impacting over 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older. Many Social Security recipients rely heavily on these checks for their income, and the garnishments may cause financial strain. However, multiple options are available for borrowers to stop the payment offsets.</p>

          <p>A TikTok video highlighting the importance of wearing sunscreen on flights has sparked discussion about sun damage risk at high altitudes. Dermatologists confirm that airplane windows block most UVB rays but not all UVA rays, which can cause premature aging and skin cancer. While the risk from occasional flights is low, flight crew members and pilots face higher exposure to ultraviolet light. Wearing sunscreen on a plane is recommended, especially for those with a history of skin cancer or increased sun sensitivity.</p>

          <p>Witnesses reported that Israeli forces fired on Palestinians waiting to receive aid near a distribution site in Gaza, resulting in over 20 deaths and numerous injuries. Hamas claimed 30 people were killed and a dozen more injured. The incident occurred amidst a monthslong Israeli blockade that has sparked international outrage. The UN has criticized the decision by the Israeli government to allow aid into Gaza, saying that deliveries have been minimal and failed to reach the people in need.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, a Musk associate, to lead NASA, citing a "thorough review" of his "prior associations." The reasons for the withdrawal remain unclear, as the White House has not provided further explanation. Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4, has collaborated closely with Musk and SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA. The nomination had been approved by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and a vote by the full Senate was anticipated.</p>
