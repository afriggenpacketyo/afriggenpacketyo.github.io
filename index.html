        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, surpassing market expectations due to sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer projects third-quarter revenue to grow by 38% from the previous year. Advanced chips, those 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted 74% of the company's total revenue, highlighting the significant impact of the AI sector on its performance. However, the company noted potential challenges ahead, including potential U.S. trade tariffs and order reductions from smartphone clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's labor market is weakening, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate increased to 4.7% while the annual rate of wage growth decelerated to 5% in the three months leading up to May. Concurrently, job vacancies have continued their three-year decline, reaching their lowest point in a decade, excluding the pandemic period. These indicators are increasing speculation that the Bank of England may implement an interest rate cut next month to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Premier Li Qiang has called for increased oversight of pricing, particularly within the electric vehicle industry, to address fierce price wars that are contributing to deflationary pressures on the economy. During a high-level meeting, Li emphasized the need for major automakers to practice self-discipline and focus on technological innovation rather than destructive competition. This comes as China's industrial profits saw a significant 9.1% drop in May, with carmakers' profits falling 11.9% despite rising sales volumes. Economists note that Beijing faces a difficult balancing act in curbing oversupply without hindering economic growth and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a $9 billion rescissions package requested by the Trump administration, which targets previously approved funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting. The measure passed with a 51-48 vote, with Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in opposition. The package includes approximately $8 billion in cuts to foreign assistance programs like USAID and around $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The bill, which was slightly modified from the House version to spare an AIDS prevention program, now returns to the House for approval before a Friday deadline.</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Holding, is altering its U.S. market strategy due to the impact of trade tariffs. The company reported a significant drop in second-quarter operating profit and revenue, citing a challenging automotive industry environment. In response to U.S. tariffs on European and Chinese vehicles, Volvo plans to begin producing its popular XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant starting in late 2026. Simultaneously, the company is reducing its offering of sedans and station wagons in the U.S. due to declining consumer interest and the financial pressures of the tariffs.

This disciplinary action follows a similar move last year and is seen by Downing Street as a way to enforce party authority and deter future rebellions. However, some Labour MPs have described the decision as "petty," "vindictive," and a sign of weakness, arguing it could lower morale among the party's base. The suspended MPs were reportedly punished for repeatedly organizing against the government, not just for a single act of dissent.</p>

          <p>Sweeping layoffs at the U.S. State Department, part of a Trump administration plan to cut 15% of its domestic staff, have caused chaos and are raising national security concerns, according to multiple sources. The reduction of 1,353 staffers was described as poorly executed, with some key offices, such as the Office of Casualty Assistance, being entirely eliminated. Current and former officials argue the cuts were arbitrary and have weakened critical functions, including passport fraud investigation and intelligence analysis. The disarray has left some managers unaware of which employees were terminated, disrupting operations and damaging morale within the country's diplomatic corps.</p>

          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills has moved forward in the U.S. House of Representatives after a record-setting, 10-hour vote that exposed deep divisions within the Republican party. Opposition from both conservative hardliners and moderate Republicans stalled the legislation, which required last-minute negotiations and intervention from President Trump to proceed. The struggle highlights the difficulty the crypto industry faces in achieving a clear regulatory framework, despite significant lobbying efforts. The bills include measures concerning the roles of federal agencies and a proposal to prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

The deceased was identified as Robert Montgomery, a 61-year-old club member and volunteer. The injured parties, the youngest of whom is seven years old, were transported to local hospitals for treatment of various injuries, including burns.

In response, Seven & i expressed disappointment and disagreed with the Canadian firm's characterization of the negotiations.

The charity has cleared over 120,000 landmines in Angola since the end of the country's civil war, but about a thousand minefields still remain.

According to sources, the dismissal memo cited the president's powers under Article 2 of the Constitution. Maurene Comey was a notable prosecutor who helped lead the high-profile cases against Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her father, James Comey, was fired as FBI director by President Trump in 2017 during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The move is seen as another contentious personnel decision within the current administration's Justice Department.</p>

The atmosphere of uncertainty has impacted business, as fewer people are on the streets, and has forced many undocumented workers to live with constant apprehension while trying to earn an honest living.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June compared to the previous year, marking the second straight month of contraction and raising fears of a potential recession for the export-reliant economy. The decline was driven by a sharp 11.4% drop in shipments to the United States, its key trading partner, where a 25% tariff on Japanese imports is set to take effect. Automobile exports to the U.S. were hit particularly hard, falling 26.7% as carmakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share. The persistent trade friction and lack of a breakthrough in negotiations with the U.S. are casting a dark shadow over Japan's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deportation data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) indicates that a small fraction of those deported under the Trump administration had convictions for the most violent crimes. Of the approximately 100,000 people deported between January and June, less than 1% had homicide convictions, according to a document obtained by CBS News. While 70,583 of the deportees were convicted criminals, a significant portion of their offenses were for traffic or immigration violations.

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant market instability if President Trump were to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A research note from Wolfe Research predicts such a move would be "significantly negative for markets," likely causing an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The legality of firing a Fed chair for policy reasons is unclear and would likely lead to a court battle, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. Despite Trump's public complaints about Powell's interest rate policies, the White House has given conflicting signals, with Trump recently stating that firing Powell is "highly unlikely" but not ruling it out.

However, officials later downgraded the alert, stating that the quake's shallow depth meant widespread, large waves were not expected. The event took place along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," a region familiar with significant earthquake activity, but resulted in no major damage or casualties.</p>
