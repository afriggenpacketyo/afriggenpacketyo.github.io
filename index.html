          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, both countries quickly accused each other of violating the agreement. Israeli officials stated they would respond forcefully to Iranian missile launches, while Iran denied these claims. The initial ceasefire announcement followed a period of intense conflict, including Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets and subsequent Iranian counterattacks. The situation remains tense, with the future of the ceasefire uncertain as both sides monitor each other's actions and statements, and the exchange of accusations has introduced significant instability. Optimism remains low due to the fragile nature of the agreement and the deep-seated distrust between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are considering a tax deduction on car loan interest as part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aiming to fulfill President Trump's campaign promise. However, the structure of the tax break would mostly benefit those with very large auto loans, typically associated with luxury vehicles. To fully utilize the $10,000 deduction, a loan of around $112,000 would be required, implying a vehicle purchase price of approximately $130,000. The tax break's value diminishes for individuals earning over $100,000 annually, making it unlikely that many households would fully benefit from the proposed legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

The People's Daily, a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, labeled Lai's speech as containing "fabricated fallacies" and inciting cross-strait confrontation. The commentary described the speech as a "Taiwan independence" declaration, accusing Lai of being a troublemaker and a danger to peace.

          <p>Iran launched missiles at Al-Udeid, a US military base in Qatar, in retaliation for US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The US stated that it had received early warning of the attack, which allowed for the minimization of casualties, and President Trump described the attack as "very weak." Despite the attack, both Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire, with Iran stating it would only cease attacks if Israel reciprocated. The incident has raised concerns about regional stability and the potential for further escalation, but the ceasefire provides a glimmer of hope for de-escalation.</p>

Experts suggest this strategy is a calculated risk, avoiding the potential for damaging testimony from defense-friendly witnesses.

The decision reflects a belief that reasonable doubt exists, making additional witnesses unnecessary.</p>

          <p>Sae Joon Park, a Purple Heart recipient and Army veteran, self-deported to South Korea after living in the U.S. for nearly five decades. Park's removal order stemmed from drug possession charges and failure to appear in court from over 15 years ago, issues he attributes to untreated PTSD. His story highlights the challenges faced by noncitizen veterans caught in the legal system amid the Trump administration's deportation policies. Despite his service and sacrifices, Park was forced to leave the country he fought for, leaving behind his family and home.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking extensive access to sensitive personal data held by states, including information on recipients of federal food aid and Medicaid enrollees. This push aims to consolidate data across government agencies to root out waste and fraud, but raises concerns about privacy and potential misuse. Critics warn that this data could be used for surveillance and immigration enforcement, while the administration defends the effort as increasing efficiency and saving taxpayer dollars. The administration's efforts have raised legal and ethical questions about the balance between government efficiency and individual privacy.</p>

          <h2>Ceasefire Agreement Between Israel and Iran Faces Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Despite a ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump, uncertainty surrounds the actual cessation of hostilities between Israel and Iran. Initial reports of further airstrikes in Israel cast doubt on the agreement's stability, with Israel vowing to respond forcefully to any violations. Iran denied launching any missiles after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect. The ceasefire, intended to de-escalate tensions after a week of deadly exchanges, remains fragile, and its long-term viability is questionable given the mutual distrust and accusations of violations.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a nearly 5% drop on Tuesday after Israel agreed to a ceasefire with Iran, easing concerns about potential disruptions to global oil supplies. Prices had previously surged due to fears that Iran might blockade the Strait of Hormuz, a critical shipping route for oil and gas. However, prices narrowed following Israel's claim that Iran violated the ceasefire. The FTSE 100 index and other major stock markets saw gains following the ceasefire announcement, indicating a positive market response to the reduced geopolitical tensions.

          <p>China's dominance in rare earth production is increasingly reliant on supplies from Myanmar, a war-torn economy. Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year, with a significant portion being heavy rare earth elements. This reliance has strengthened China's monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain, but also exposes it to supply chain risks due to Myanmar's ongoing civil war. The rare earth extraction in Myanmar has come at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the US in the conflict between Israel and Iran may prove successful if the announced ceasefire holds. The ceasefire, declared by Trump, aims to de-escalate the situation after US airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. However, the agreement's fragility was evident when Israel accused Iran of violating the ceasefire shortly after it was implemented. If the ceasefire is sustained, it would represent a significant step back from the brink of a broader regional conflict.</p>
