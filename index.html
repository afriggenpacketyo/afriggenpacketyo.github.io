          <p>David Huerta, president of SEIU California, was injured and detained while documenting an immigration enforcement raid in downtown Los Angeles, prompting protests and calls for his release. Labor union officials stated that Huerta was exercising his First Amendment right to observe law enforcement activity when he was detained. Federal authorities claim Huerta deliberately obstructed agents' access to a worksite. Elected officials condemned Huerta's arrest, while federal authorities asserted that there is no First Amendment right to physically obstruct law enforcement. Aside from Huerta, 44 people were arrested during the immigration action, leading to hundreds rallying and protesting the crackdown. </p>

          <p>Global spirit makers are facing a mix of challenges, including tariffs and shifts in drinking habits, impacting sales and targets. Rémy Cointreau withdrew its sales targets due to economic and trade uncertainties, particularly U.S.-China tariff policies and a lack of recovery in the U.S. market. Full-year sales at the group's cognac business fell 22% due to slowing U.S. consumption and complex market conditions in China. Other spirit makers like LVMH and Diageo are also experiencing declines in certain spirit categories, indicating a broader correction in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador nearly four months ago, has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges, sparking reactions from Maryland leaders. An indictment unsealed Friday accuses Abrego Garcia of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people, alleging his involvement in an alien smuggling ring. Senator Chris Van Hollen emphasized that the case is about Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights and due process. Despite the criminal allegations, leaders and advocates have called out the Trump administration for denying due process in the case and have fought for Abrego Garcia's return, with some stating that he should not have been deported in the first place.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year, as police focus on employers exploiting undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested over 6,400 people in raids at businesses, which are often found to subject migrants to squalid conditions and illegal working hours. The government aims to tackle abuse of the UK immigration system and the exploitation of vulnerable people. The government has also returned nearly 30,000 people who did not have the right to be in the UK and is cracking down on illegal migration through tightened work visas.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports history. The settlement permits schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue. The agreement brings professionalization to college athletics, impacting recruitment, program offerings, and the overall structure of the NCAA. The deal also brings some uniformity to the rules, states still have separate laws regarding how NIL can be doled out, which could lead to legal challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era for college sports where athletes can be directly paid by colleges. Starting this fall, NCAA's top division schools can pay athletes, capped initially at $20.5 million per school, and over $2 billion will be paid to former athletes who were not allowed to earn money while in school. The settlement arose from lawsuits challenging the NCAA's tradition of amateurism, given the exponential growth of money in college athletics. Half of the NCAA's Division I schools are expected to adopt the new framework, while a third-party clearinghouse will review licensing agreements for fair market value.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are working towards a tariff deal by mid-June, despite not yet reaching common ground on key issues. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed belief that further progress was made after talks with U.S. officials. Japan has presented a package of proposals to U.S. Cabinet members, including strengthening supply chains, cooperation in shipbuilding, and expanding imports of U.S. farm products. Japan is seeking the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently amount to a total rate of 24 percent.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered coal and gas plants to keep running, despite the fact that grid operators never asked for them to remain open. The decision could result in consumers having to absorb extra costs associated with keeping these plants operational. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to support the fossil fuel industry. This decision comes at a time when many coal and gas plants were already closing due to economic factors and environmental concerns.</p>

With a national election looming, Ishiba aims to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system. Ishiba is pursuing a consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice to lower prices. He has long advocated for reforming the policy, believing it hinders the development of agricultural businesses, and has pledged to boost rice exports to prevent potential overproduction from driving down prices.</p>

The lawsuit alleges the county's drone policy has loosened, now allowing discretionary proactive investigations without requiring a complaint about a property first.</p>
