          <p>A wildfire in San Luis Obispo County, dubbed the Madre fire, has rapidly expanded to over 70,800 acres, making it the largest blaze in California this year. The fire, which is only 10% contained, poses a significant threat to life and property, with over 200 people under evacuation orders and 50 structures at risk. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, more than 600 personnel are battling the flames, which have already destroyed one structure. The cause of the fire, which started on Wednesday afternoon in a rural area, is still under investigation by authorities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a major tax and spending package into law, a day after it narrowly passed in Congress. The legislation makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent, increases defense and border security funding, and enacts significant spending cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid. Despite Republican celebration, the bill faced strong opposition from Democrats, who raised concerns over its projected $3 trillion addition to the national debt and the potential for millions to lose health insurance coverage. The administration has dubbed it the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," achieving a key policy goal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White has implied that star player Caitlin Clark offered to pay a fine she received for a technical foul during a game against the Las Vegas Aces. White was penalized for yelling at officials, and Clark, who was not playing due to injury, reportedly made the offer to cover the cost. The incident is highlighted as part of a more rebellious and confident team culture developing around the Fever, who recently won the WNBA's Commissioner's Cup. The article also notes other instances of the team's assertive new attitude on and off the court.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal taxes on Social Security, the reality is more nuanced. The legislation does not repeal the tax on benefits but instead introduces a new, temporary "bonus" deduction for seniors, which can lower their overall taxable income. This deduction, up to $6,000 for individuals earning under $75,000, applies to all income, not just Social Security. Policy experts note that this change primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not help low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax, while potentially adding to Social Security's financial strain.

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The discovery was made after coroner's personnel gained access to the site of the incident, which occurred at a business named Devastating Pyrotechnics. Seven people had been reported as unaccounted for following the blast, which destroyed multiple structures and sparked grass fires across 80 acres. The investigation is ongoing, with federal agencies assisting, and it has been revealed that the business lacked local permits to store fireworks on the agricultural property.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records who are currently being held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti. The court's order effectively nullified a lower court's injunction that had blocked their removal to a third country, in this case, South Sudan, without a chance to contest it. The administration argued the deportations were lawful, while dissenting justices expressed grave concerns that the individuals could face torture or death upon arrival.

The bill also allocates billions for border security, raises the SALT tax deduction cap to $40,000, and terminates many green energy tax credits.

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change due to their epic annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn that fat over the winter. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from entering the atmosphere. The findings highlight a much larger role for these organisms in regulating the global climate than previously understood.</p>

The fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the probate system by monitoring a public list of unclaimed estates and then producing fake wills naming themselves as the sole heir. This allows them to gain legal control of assets, including valuable properties, and commit tax fraud by undervaluing the estates. The investigation highlights several cases where families were cheated out of their inheritance, revealing a system that relies heavily on trust and is vulnerable to abuse.</p>

The bill's structure, which extends tax cuts favoring high earners and business owners while capping state and local tax deductions, creates this disparity.

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration policies and the recent passage of a budget bill that significantly funds them. Demonstrators marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, expressing fear and anger over the ongoing ICE raids that have created a climate of fear in the region. Many attendees said they were skipping traditional holiday celebrations to stand in solidarity with immigrant communities. The protest highlighted the heightened tensions between local leaders and the federal government over immigration enforcement and the use of National Guard troops.</p>

          <p>Germany started their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the eight-time champions secured the win, the match was overshadowed by a potentially serious injury to their captain, Giulia Gwinn. The Bayern Munich fullback, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, left the pitch in tears in the first half after a knee injury, casting doubt on her future participation in the tournament. The team now faces a nervous wait for MRI results to determine the extent of the damage to their key player.</p>

          <p>The rivalry between India and China for leadership of the Global South is becoming more apparent within alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Decision-making in the SCO requires consensus, a rule that India has used to assert its position against China's. This was evident at a recent defense ministers' meeting where India's objections over language related to terrorism prevented the adoption of a joint statement. The incident underscores the ongoing friction between the two nations, which complicates China's ambitions to lead blocs like the SCO and BRICS.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated India by five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the five-match series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but England seamer Lauren Bell secured the win by dismissing India's captain. The victory came despite a chaotic collapse in England's own innings, where they lost nine wickets for just 31 runs after a strong opening partnership. A pivotal spell of fast bowling from Lauren Filer in the second innings changed the game's momentum, helping England defend their total in a nerve-wracking finish.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jamie Smith's record-breaking innings against India has solidified his status as one of the nation's most promising talents. In the second Test at Edgbaston, the 24-year-old wicketkeeper-batter scored 184 not out, the highest score ever by an England wicketkeeper in a men's Test. This performance, marked by aggressive and powerful hitting, is seen as the perfect embodiment of the team's desired playing style under its current leadership. The article suggests that if Smith continues on this trajectory, he has the potential to become England's greatest-ever wicketkeeper-batter, drawing comparisons to Australian legend Adam Gilchrist.</p>
