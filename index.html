          <p>An official excavation has commenced at the site of a former church-run home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave containing the remains of nearly 800 infants and young children is believed to exist. The St Mary's home, operated by the Bon Secours Sisters from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. The horrific discovery was first brought to light by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, whose research indicated that hundreds of children who died at the home were buried in an unmarked site, possibly a disused sewage tank. The two-year excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a long-awaited, painful truth to light for survivors and relatives.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, emphasizing the strengthening ties between their nations. During the meeting, Lavrov warned the United States, Japan, and South Korea against forming military alliances perceived as antagonistic towards Russia and North Korea. This diplomatic engagement occurs as North Korea continues to supply Russia with munitions for its war in Ukraine, and as the U.S. and its regional allies expand their joint military drills in response to North Korea's advancing nuclear program. Lavrov described the talks as a continuation of the countries' "strategic dialogue."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 30% tariff on goods imported from both Mexico and the European Union, scheduled to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, President Trump stated that while Mexico has assisted in border security, its efforts are insufficient to curb drug trafficking. Similarly, he characterized the trade relationship with the EU as not "reciprocal," citing persistent trade deficits as a threat to national security. The move has drawn concern from both trading partners, with the EU stating it will take necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including potential countermeasures.</p>

          <p>Sweden secured a decisive 4-1 victory over Germany, finishing at the top of their group in the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. This win marks a significant statement from the Swedish team, who have historically performed well in tournaments but have not won the championship since its inaugural year in 1984. Midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd expressed strong confidence in her squad, suggesting there is "something different" about the team this year and that they have the potential to win the entire tournament. The victory sets up a quarter-final match for Sweden against the runner-up from Group D, potentially England or France.</p>

          <p>A recent study analyzing federal traffic data has identified the most dangerous times to drive in the ten most populous U.S. states. The findings reveal that evening hours are predominantly the deadliest, with the 6:00 p.m. to 6:59 p.m. window being the most hazardous in four of the ten states, including New York and Ohio. In California, the most dangerous hour is between 8:00 p.m. and 8:59 p.m., while in Texas, it is an hour later, from 9:00 p.m. to 9:59 p.m. Pennsylvania was the only state where the most dangerous time was in the afternoon, between 3:00 p.m. and 3:59 p.m., highlighting the risks associated with rush hour and dusk.</p>

Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for entry, described the conditions as "appalling," citing high temperatures, inadequate water access, and small food portions after their visit. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction, with one senator calling the beds comfortable. The facility, which was built rapidly, has faced scrutiny over claims of inhumane conditions from detainees, which state officials have consistently denied.</p>

The article highlights individuals who feel less pressure to marry or have children, believing that future AI and robotics will provide companionship and elderly care, traditionally fulfilled by family. While AI is often blamed for reducing incentives for family formation, some experts argue this technological shift may not be entirely negative. They suggest that the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine societal structures around life and family, potentially making traditional demographic concerns obsolete.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's purge of the Justice Department has reportedly expanded, with the firing of over 20 employees who worked on investigations into the former president and the January 6 Capitol riot. Sources indicate that those dismissed were part of former Special Counsel Jack Smith's team, which handled the classified documents and 2020 election interference cases. The terminations were allegedly directed by a "weaponization working group" established by Attorney General Pam Bondi to review Biden-era law enforcement policies. A fired public affairs specialist warned that the traditional separation between the White House and the Justice Department is now gone.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old American citizen from Florida, Sayfollah Musallet, was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers while visiting family in the occupied West Bank. According to his family and Palestinian health officials, Musallet was protecting his family's land in the town of Sinjil when he was attacked. He is the fifth American to be killed in the West Bank since October 2023. The Israel Defense Forces stated it was aware of a violent confrontation in the area and that the incident was being investigated. Musallet's family is demanding an immediate investigation by the U.S. State Department to hold the perpetrators accountable.</p>

          <p>In what was dubbed the "shortest call" in the show's history, financial personality Dave Ramsey gave blunt advice to a long-time listener. The caller, who had $211,000 in cash and a $95,000 mortgage, was emphatically told to pay off the house immediately. The article highlights this moment as a classic example of Ramsey's philosophy, which prioritizes the emotional and behavioral benefits of being debt-free over purely mathematical gains. It also notes the financial counter-argument, pointing out that investing the cash in the market could potentially yield higher returns than the interest saved on a low-rate mortgage.

          <p>England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, has defended his team's use of delay tactics at the end of day three of the third Test against India. English opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the game, ensuring he and his partner would only face one over before the close of play, which angered the Indian team. Southee pointed out that India had used similar time-wasting tactics earlier in the match, including a lengthy delay for captain Shubman Gill to receive a massage on the field. The incident added a layer of tension to the closely contested match at Lord's, with both sides animated by the strategic gamesmanship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has discreetly pushed back against criticism from the Trump administration regarding its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. The central bank updated its website with a new FAQ page to defend the project, directly addressing claims made by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who called the overhaul "ostentatious." The Fed's page clarifies that no new VIP dining rooms are being built and explains that cost increases were due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes. This response comes as the administration intensifies its campaign against Fed Chairman Jerome Powell over interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested 71 people at protests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester against the UK government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The government banned the group under the Terrorism Act, making support for it a criminal offense. The proscription followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and painted aircraft. Protesters gathered for a second weekend, holding signs opposing the ban and what they term a genocide in Gaza. Critics, including the group's legal team, have accused the government of an "authoritarian abuse" of power by using anti-terror legislation against the activist organization.</p>

          <p>An aviation expert has suggested that a chip malfunction, rather than pilot error, is a plausible cause for the fatal Air India crash, based on the preliminary investigation report. The report detailed how the Boeing 787's engine fuel switches moved to the cutoff position, starving the engines of fuel. Analyst Marco Chan pointed to a known issue with a chip in the engine system that, if not properly maintained, could lead to a signal loss and inadvertently cut the fuel supply. This technical perspective provides a potential explanation for the crash that killed 260 people, as investigators continue their work.</p>
