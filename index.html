          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated he offered Democrats a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies in an attempt to end the ongoing government shutdown. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer disputed this, claiming no formal proposal was made. The disagreement highlights the deep partisan divide prolonging the shutdown, which has entered its 16th day. Republicans maintain they will not negotiate on policy details until the government reopens, while Democrats insist on a healthcare agreement as a precondition.</p>

          <p>Shares of regional banks, including Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance Bancorp, experienced a significant drop following concerns about souring loans on Wall Street. The anxiety was triggered by recent bankruptcies in the auto-parts sector and disclosures from the banks about potential charge-offs and borrower fraud. This has renewed investor fears about the health of the banking industry, particularly in the opaque private credit market, echoing concerns from the 2023 banking crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

While the carrier has not yet seen a significant impact, Kirby believes that as the shutdown continues, declining consumer confidence in the government's ability to resolve the issue will deter travel. The warning comes as essential aviation employees like air traffic controllers and TSA officers continue to work without pay, raising concerns about staffing and operational stability in the airline industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced his intention to move forward with a bill to impose new, stringent sanctions on Russia, stating that "the time has come." The legislation, which has strong bipartisan support, aims to increase economic pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The push for a vote has been renewed following President Trump's recent diplomatic engagement with Vladimir Putin. The proposed bill includes measures like a 500% tariff on goods from countries that purchase Russian energy, though the White House has previously sought more flexibility in its implementation.</p>

          <p>In the wake of an undercover investigation that exposed misogyny and racism within the force, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has promised to be "ruthless" in removing rogue officers. Speaking to the London Assembly, he stated that the force is undergoing the "biggest clear-out" in its history, having already removed over 1,500 officers and staff since 2022. The commissioner acknowledged the "vile and shocking" behavior uncovered and outlined measures like more intrusive vetting to restore public trust, which has been severely damaged by recent scandals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential U.S. supply of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine is a significant point of discussion, as these weapons could alter the strategic balance of the war. With a range of up to 1,600 kilometers, Tomahawks would enable Ukraine to strike key military and industrial targets deep inside Russia. The missile's key advantage is its ability to fly at very low altitudes, making it difficult for Russian air defense systems to intercept. However, experts note that the high cost and limited production rate mean Ukraine would likely receive a quantity that is strategically significant but not war-deciding.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that the Trump administration is escalating military threats against Venezuela under the guise of a "war on drugs," pointing to recent CIA operations and extrajudicial killings at sea. The piece suggests that hawkish figures in the administration have prevailed in pushing for a more aggressive stance toward Nicolás Maduro's regime. While the public discussion of these actions may be a tactic to pressure Maduro, the editorial warns of the U.S.'s long, inglorious history of intervention in Latin America and the risk of another foreign policy fiasco.</p>

          <p>Two men from Trinidad and Tobago have been identified by family as being among the six people killed in a recent U.S. airstrike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela. The Trump administration claimed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, but family members of one of the men insist he was not involved in drugs. The incident is part of a series of deadly U.S. attacks in the Caribbean, which the administration defends as necessary for its "war on drugs." The strikes have instilled fear in local fishing communities and drawn criticism from some Caribbean leaders.</p>

          <p>A profile examines the eclectic political identity of Colorado's Democratic Governor, Jared Polis, labeling him a potential "MAHA Democrat." Polis has found common ground with the Trump administration's Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on issues like banning soda purchases with food stamps, while strongly opposing Kennedy's anti-vaccine stances. This unique positioning reflects Polis's blend of libertarian, progressive, and populist beliefs, allowing him to support popular health initiatives without fully aligning with the controversial "Make America Healthy Again" movement. The article highlights the complex political landscape surrounding public health policy.</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's new film "Frankenstein" is being hailed as a career-best, faithfully adapting Mary Shelley's novel while infusing it with modern anxieties about technology and ambition. The review praises Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Victor Frankenstein as an arrogant, egomaniacal "tech bro" and Jacob Elordi's Creature as a tragically compelling figure. The film's production design, score, and cinematography are highlighted as superb, creating a visually stunning and emotionally resonant horror story. It critiques the hubris of inventors who fail to consider the consequences of their creations.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, fell in a hallway at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday afternoon. The senator, who has had previous falls and walks with a limp from childhood polio, appeared unsteady but was able to get up with assistance from his security detail and continued on to cast his votes. McConnell announced earlier this year that he would step down from his longtime role as Republican leader and will retire from the Senate at the end of his term.

He stated that this represents the "biggest shift" in the agency's mission since 9/11, with state-sponsored threats now descending into methods typically seen in terrorism cases. McCallum revealed that MI5 had disrupted 19 late-stage terror plots since 2020 and highlighted China's activities as a daily national security concern for the UK.</p>
