          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Stephen Miran, a White House economist, for a temporary seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. The appointment aims to fill a vacancy left by Adriana Kugler, who is departing six months early. Miran, who currently chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, previously served in the Treasury Department during Trump's first term. This move represents Trump's first opportunity to influence the Fed's board since his return to office, amidst his public criticism of the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>A former security officer at the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic has been charged with smuggling cocaine into the New York area. According to the Department of Justice, Jairo Eliezer Arias Caceres allegedly concealed the drugs in Marlboro cartons and Choco-pie boxes. Prosecutors accuse the 35-year-old of running a transnational conspiracy from April to December 2023, where he recruited and managed couriers for the smuggling operation. Arias Caceres had previously worked as a security officer at the Santo Domingo airport for seven years before his role at the embassy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously sided with environmental groups, ruling that a state commission's decision to reduce rooftop solar incentives can be legally challenged. The case will now return to an appeals court for further review. The dispute centers on a 2022 decision by the Public Utilities Commission that significantly cut the value of credits for homeowners who send excess solar power to the grid. While the commission argued the cuts were necessary to prevent cost shifts to non-solar customers, environmental groups contend the move violates state law and hinders California's clean energy goals.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again suggested a federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s government, pointing to crime as a primary justification, although his legal authority to do so is limited. The president's comments followed an attempted carjacking involving a government staff member. However, such a move would require an act of Congress to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act, which is considered unlikely. The article notes that despite Trump's claims, data from D.C. police shows that violent crime rates in the city have actually been declining significantly in 2025.</p>

The review suggests that while the chemistry between Lohan and Curtis remains a major highlight, the plot feels rushed and less emotionally insightful than its predecessor.

          <p>This article explains the legal process through which a debt collector can freeze a person's bank account. It clarifies that this action cannot be taken arbitrarily; the collector must first file a lawsuit and obtain a court judgment against the debtor. The article also notes that certain funds, such as Social Security benefits and disability payments, are legally protected from garnishment even after a judgment is issued. For those whose accounts are frozen, options include filing an exemption claim with the court or negotiating a payment plan with the collector to have the freeze lifted.</p>

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking a nearly $10 billion rate hike over the next four years, a proposal that environmental groups claim would be the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the increase is necessary to maintain grid reliability and invest in solar and battery storage facilities. However, advocacy groups like Food & Water Watch contend the hike would exacerbate the state's affordability crisis and disproportionately funnel profits to shareholders. The Florida Public Service Commission will hold hearings on the proposal before making a final decision.</p>

          <p>Following the completion of Skydance Media's $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, new CEO David Ellison was immediately questioned about a rumored deal with President Trump. The questions relate to Trump's claims that he is owed $20 million in free advertising as part of a settlement for his lawsuit against CBS's "60 Minutes." Ellison deflected direct questions about the issue, stating his team would not "politicize anything" and that Skydance was not involved in the settlement. He affirmed his support for the CBS News division and its journalistic integrity.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a money market account would earn more interest on a $20,000 deposit in the current economic climate. While a money market account may currently offer a slightly higher interest rate, its rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. In contrast, a CD's rate is fixed, guaranteeing the return over its term. The analysis concludes that while a money market account might technically earn a few more dollars, a CD offers predictability and is more likely to achieve a guaranteed interest goal.

Co-founder Sam Altman described the new model as offering "PhD-level expertise" on any topic and possessing superior reasoning abilities. The launch comes as tech companies continue to compete fiercely in the AI space. However, some ethics experts express concern that AI capabilities are advancing faster than regulatory frameworks and question whether the launch is driven more by marketing hype than a true technological revolution.</p>

During a visit to Panama, Kevin Marino Cabrera criticized the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, labeling it a "bad operator" and a "company of the Communist Party." His remarks come as the company's 25-year concession renewal faces legal challenges in Panama's Supreme Court over alleged procedural and financial irregularities.

Now, 43.2% of investors surveyed have a negative six-month outlook for the stock market, the most pessimistic reading since the market top in February. Some market strategists view this widespread negativity as a contrarian bullish indicator, suggesting that with many investors already having sold stocks, there is more cash available to fuel a future rally.

Fortinet's stock fell 25% after it revealed its firewall refresh cycle was further along than expected, dragging down peers like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks. The author argues this sell-off is an overreaction, as companies like CrowdStrike have different business models and are not reliant on the same hardware cycles. The dip is seen as a chance to invest in strong companies at a lower price. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, conducted from August 2021 to August 2023, found that the proportion was even higher for young people aged 1 to 18, at nearly 62%. Ultra-processed foods are described as energy-dense, low in fiber, and high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats.
