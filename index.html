          <p>Nottinghamshire Police have launched a corporate manslaughter investigation into the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS trust following failings that led to hundreds of baby deaths and injuries at its maternity units. The investigation, dubbed Operation Perth, will focus on two maternity units run by the trust, examining about 2,500 cases of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, and harm to mothers and babies. Campaigners, including parents who lost their daughter due to the trust's failings, welcomed the investigation as a step toward accountability, though they emphasized the need for individual responsibility. The hospital trust has expressed deep sorrow and pledged full cooperation with both the police investigation and an independent review of maternity services. </p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize the nation's flight paths through the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS), potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and more efficient climbs and descents for aircraft. The initial focus will be on redesigning the complex airspace around London, with changes expected to be implemented in stages, starting in the 2030s. While ministers tout environmental benefits and technological advancements like flying taxis, some residents fear increased noise pollution from new flight paths over previously unaffected areas. Aviation industry leaders have lauded the changes as long overdue, emphasizing the potential for CO2 reductions and a sustainable future for air travel.</p>

Seven officers were injured and five police cars were damaged when Azarbonyad slammed on his brakes, causing the pursuing vehicles to crash into each other. The judge described it as a miracle that there were not multiple fatalities, emphasizing Azarbonyad's deliberate decision to flee from the police.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been booked on multiple charges, including the use of an incendiary device and first-degree murder, after allegedly attacking a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado. Eight people were hospitalized with burns, ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one victim in critical condition. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack, using a "makeshift flamethrower" and throwing an incendiary device at the crowd. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology, as it occurred during a Run for Their Lives walk, which aimed to raise awareness about hostages in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative historian, narrowly won the Polish presidential runoff, defeating liberal-conservative Rafal Trzaskowski and delivering a significant setback to Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-European government. Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, campaigned on a platform of a "Poland without migrants" and is expected to obstruct government reforms, particularly those related to the rule of law. His victory is anticipated to narrow the government's foreign policy maneuvering and potentially lead to Poland distancing itself from Europe, similar to Hungary under Viktor Orban. The election outcome has been described as a "political earthquake" that will likely deepen existing divisions within Poland.</p>

The National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology reported increasing intensity in the explosions, with activity from the Southeast Crater becoming a lava fountain. While the eruption has caused a massive plume of smoke and ash, there are no immediate reports of risk to the local population or air travel, as the area is accustomed to Etna's frequent eruptions.

          <p>A new Social Security Administration policy requiring nearly 2 million additional beneficiaries to visit agency offices to change direct deposit information is causing concern due to increased travel burdens for seniors. Almost one-quarter of seniors live more than an hour away from their local Social Security field office, and half need to drive at least 33 minutes, leading to over 1 million hours of travel per year. The policy change, aimed at curbing fraud, has been criticized as an overreaction, especially given that many seniors lack internet access or have difficulty traveling. Advocates argue that staffing cuts at Social Security offices may exacerbate appointment wait times, further burdening beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>Sri Lankan customs authorities arrested a Thai woman after discovering nearly 10 kilograms of cocaine stuffed inside three plush toys at the Bandaranaike International Airport. The cocaine, neatly packed into over 500 plastic capsules, has an estimated street value of $1.72 million, marking the largest cocaine seizure ever at the airport. The arrest follows three other recent hauls totaling nearly 60 kilograms of synthetic cannabis, leading to the arrest of three foreign nationals. All four suspects could face life imprisonment if convicted, as Sri Lanka is believed to be a transit hub for narcotics destined for other locations.</p>

          <p>First-time homebuyers are increasingly opting for longer mortgage terms, averaging 31 years, to manage affordability amidst high house prices and mortgage rates. A decade ago, the average mortgage term for first-time buyers was 28 years, but rising costs have pushed borrowers to extend their repayment periods. Lenders typically allow mortgage terms up to 40 years, making them popular among young homeowners stretching their finances. Despite recent drops in mortgage rates, these longer terms show no sign of decreasing, as the initial mortgage payments relative to income remain high.</p>

          <p>Treasuries experienced a decline amidst a widespread selloff of US assets, driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, ahead of a busy week for economic data. Longer bond maturities led the drop, causing the yield on 10-year debt to rise, as the spread between five- and 30-year yields widened. The moves coincided with a lower open for US equity futures and a weakening dollar. The possibility of further trade actions from the US president, who announced increased tariffs on steel and aluminum, contributes to the market's unease. (not investment advice)</p>
