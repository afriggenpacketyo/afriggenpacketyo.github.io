          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated in an interview with ABC News that Ukraine is ready for a ceasefire brokered by the United States, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of seeking the "total defeat" of Ukraine. Zelenskyy emphasized that Putin is uninterested in peace and only strong pressure from the U.S. and European allies would make him pragmatic. He also mentioned a recent Ukrainian drone attack on Russian airfields, planned over 18 months and dubbed "Operation Spiderweb," aimed at improving Ukraine's negotiating position. Zelenskyy called for a ceasefire without conditions, suggesting diplomacy will run through the White House, and expressed disagreement with Trump's view of Putin's intentions.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office has drawn criticism for downplaying the riots in Los Angeles, comparing them to sports celebrations that often result in property damage. This comparison comes amid claims from California Republicans that Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass are partly to blame for the riots due to their support for illegal immigrants and condemnation of federal agents carrying out deportation raids. Federal officials have also blamed Democratic elected officials for demonizing ICE law enforcement, contributing to the violence. Newsom described the Trump administration's immigration raids as chaotic and reckless. </p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to a large egg recall by the August Egg Company has resulted in at least 79 people becoming ill across seven states, with 21 hospitalizations. The company recalled approximately 1.7 million brown organic and brown cage-free eggs distributed to grocery stores between February and May due to potential salmonella contamination. Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, severe vomiting, dehydration, and stomach cramps, with infections being more severe in young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered in Madrid to protest against government corruption in Spain, led by the opposition Popular Party (PP). Protesters chanted for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's resignation in response to leaked audio recordings allegedly showing a smear campaign against a police unit investigating graft allegations against Sanchez's wife and allies. PP leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo accused the government of mafia practices and demanded a snap election, while Sanchez dismissed the investigations as a right-wing smear campaign.
