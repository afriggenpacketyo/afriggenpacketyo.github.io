          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple broken bones after a significant car crash in New Hampshire. The incident occurred shortly after Giuliani and an associate had stopped to assist a woman on the roadside who reported being a victim of domestic violence. After state police arrived and they resumed their journey, their vehicle was struck from behind at high speed, causing heavy damage and what were described as non-life-threatening injuries to all three individuals involved in the collision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Premier League clubs have set a new transfer spending record, with the total outlay for the summer window surpassing an unprecedented £3 billion. This figure, driven by major deals like Alexander Isak's £125 million move to Liverpool, dwarfs the spending of other top European leagues combined. The massive expenditure highlights the Premier League's immense financial power, with even newly promoted clubs like Sunderland spending heavily to compete. This trend is leading analysts to suggest other major European leagues are becoming 'feeder leagues' to England's top flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has concluded its most expensive transfer window ever, spending approximately £415 million on new players, a stark contrast to previous, more conservative approaches. This record outlay was fueled by accumulated funds, strong commercial growth, and a desire to build upon last season's title success under new manager Arne Slot. Key acquisitions included Florian Wirtz for £100 million and a British record £125 million for striker Alexander Isak, a move necessitated in part by the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, which cast a shadow over the club's ambitious summer.</p>

          <p>Global food giant Nestlé has dismissed its CEO, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation confirmed he was in an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The company stated the decision was necessary to uphold its strong values and governance, as the relationship represented a conflict of interest. The inquiry was reportedly initiated through a whistleblower channel, and Freixe, who had been with the company for nearly 40 years and CEO for one, will not receive an exit package.

          <p>A new study using advanced dating techniques has determined that the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, is at least 286,000 years old. This new, reliable minimum age places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of debate over its timeline. The findings suggest its owner, likely a member of the Homo heidelbergensis species, coexisted with early Neanderthals, adding complexity to Europe's evolutionary history. This research underscores that human evolution was not a linear progression but a complex story of overlapping and diverse populations.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated threats to punish Russia for its ongoing aggression in Ukraine, his administration has held back from deploying its most severe economic sanctions. Analysts suggest this hesitation is strategic, stemming from two key factors: Trump's desire to be seen as a peace-broker who can bring both sides to the negotiating table, and a broader concern within Washington about pushing Russia into a deeper alliance with China. The fear is that completely isolating Moscow would strengthen Beijing by giving it greater access to Russian energy, military technology, and Arctic resources.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has prioritized experience and continuity in his six wildcard picks for the upcoming event at Bethpage. All six selections—Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka, Jon Rahm, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, and Matt Fitzpatrick—were part of the victorious 2023 team in Rome. This means 11 of the 12 players from that triumph will return, a historic level of team consistency. Donald stated that while he values the memory of the Rome victory, he is preparing his team for a completely different challenge in what he expects to be a hostile "bear pit" atmosphere in New York.</p>

This display of partnership comes as India faces new 25% U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump in retaliation for its continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Modi described the relationship with Moscow as "special and privileged," while Putin hailed it as friendly and trusting. The meeting highlights a deepening alignment between New Delhi, Moscow, and Beijing as a response to Washington's economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, residents of New Orleans are sharing stories of loss, resilience, and the storm's enduring legacy. The catastrophic levee failures led to widespread flooding that decimated entire neighborhoods, like the Ninth Ward, and took nearly 1,400 lives across the region. In personal accounts, residents recall the chaos of the storm, the difficult process of rebuilding, and the permanent changes to their communities. Many express an unbreakable connection to the city, having rebuilt their homes and lives despite the immense challenges and lingering scars.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, 'The Smashing Machine,' features Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic turn as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary, explores the crisis Kerr faced after his first loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance is praised as the only possible casting for the man-mountain athlete, and he effectively portrays Kerr's vulnerability. While the film is considered a solid drama, particularly for UFC fans, some critics note that it doesn't fully explore its emotional themes or elevate co-star Emily Blunt's role.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs and be more transparent with their data. His comments come amid significant leadership upheaval at the CDC, including the recent firing of its director, and a new FDA decision to limit the latest vaccines to high-risk individuals. Trump acknowledged that many view the drugs as life-saving miracles while others disagree, stating he wants an answer to the question of their efficacy. He also referenced the turmoil involving HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the CDC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data reveals that the number of immigrant workers in the U.S. has fallen by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year. This decline coincides with the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, which have slowed the flow of migrants and increased enforcement. Immigrants constitute a significant portion of the workforce in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and services. Economists suggest this drop could strain the labor market, affect states dependent on foreign labor, and complicate economic signals for policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a temporary suspension of new applications for its refugee family reunion program. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the move is intended to align the rules for refugees with those for other migrants, who must meet income and accommodation requirements to bring family members to the UK. The government argues the existing, unconditional route has strained local councils, which often must provide housing for newly arrived families. Critics, however, argue the changes are insufficient to address broader border security issues.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reacted strongly to a display of camaraderie between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who were seen holding hands at a summit in China. In a social media post, Trump described the U.S.-India trade relationship as a "one sided disaster," criticizing India for high tariffs and its reliance on Russian oil and military hardware. The public warmth between Modi, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the anti-Western coalition summit signals a potential shift in geopolitical alignments, seemingly prompted by Trump's aggressive tariff policies.</p>
