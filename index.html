          <p>In a new documentary, Dr. Mildred Muhammad, the ex-wife of "D.C. Sniper" John Allen Muhammad, reveals the psychological abuse she endured and a direct threat he made before his 2002 killing spree. She details how his behavior changed after his service in Operation Desert Storm, becoming paranoid and controlling, and how he once told her, "You have become my enemy, and as my enemy, I will kill you." The documentary explores the theory that the sniper attacks, which killed 10 people, were part of a plot to kill her and regain custody of their children. Muhammad now advocates for survivors of domestic violence.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is expected to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, threatening Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic with potentially catastrophic conditions early next week. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for "life-threatening" flash flooding and landslides, with some areas forecast to receive up to three feet of rain. As of Saturday morning, the storm was located southeast of Jamaica with sustained winds of 75 mph. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland, it could become the strongest system of the Atlantic season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris suggested she is considering another run for the presidency, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign and asserted that her warnings about Donald Trump's presidency have proven correct, calling him a "tyrant." Despite her comments, recent polling in her home state of California shows limited support for a 2028 bid, with fewer than a third of voters endorsing another attempt. The White House dismissed her assertions, stating the American people "don't care about her absurd lies."</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a "torture" of a match, according to head coach Shaun Wane, after a comprehensive 26-6 loss to Australia at Wembley. The match was the first in an Ashes series in 22 years, but England was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities. Australia, despite a slow start, demonstrated superior quality, with player of the match Reece Walsh playing a pivotal role. The defeat puts Australia in a position to retain the Ashes with a win in the next match in Liverpool, extending an unbeaten Test series run on UK soil that dates back 66 years.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required surgery to remove 80 to 100 high-powered magnets he had ingested, which had clamped together inside his digestive system. The magnets, purchased online, formed four chains in his bowel and large intestine, causing pressure necrosis, or tissue death. Doctors successfully removed the magnets, and the teen was discharged after an eight-day hospital stay. The case highlights the dangers of such magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys but can cause severe internal injuries if swallowed. New Zealand has banned their sale, but enforcement is difficult due to online availability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market is currently described as being in a "Great Freeze," a state where both hiring and firing rates are low. Companies are reportedly "labor hoarding," retaining employees due to uncertainty and memories of post-pandemic labor shortages, but are also hesitant to add new headcount. This environment provides job security for those currently employed but creates significant challenges for the unemployed and hinders career advancement for workers seeking new opportunities. Economists suggest this stagnation could persist, as there is no clear catalyst to shift the market out of its current malaise. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that it's difficult to consistently choose the right stock or fund, but saving money on everyday items like toilet paper and toothpaste provides a guaranteed return. Cuban illustrates that saving 40% on a $2,000 annual budget for such items yields $800 in savings, which he calls a practical and effective investment. He also cautions against using credit cards for these purchases, emphasizing that the savings are only realized if not offset by interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge, officers fired upon a U-Haul truck that was reversing towards them outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The driver, who was wounded in the incident, reportedly drove erratically before accelerating toward a line of security personnel. The protest was organized in response to plans to use the base as a staging area for Border Patrol agents, although the operation was later canceled. The day-long demonstration had been tense, with flash bangs and smoke grenades used earlier to disperse crowds. The FBI is now leading the investigation into the shooting.</p>

          <p>The recent demolition of the White House's historic East Wing to make way for a new ballroom has been described as "shocking to the conscience" by political observers. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the move as a symbol of Donald Trump's presidency, suggesting it shows a disregard for tradition and historical preservation. One writer noted that for those who admire the presidency, the act signifies that Trump is operating without concern for established norms or checks and balances. The demolition was completed in just three days, further fueling debate over the president's authority to alter such a significant national landmark.</p>

          <p>Following the demolition of the White House East Wing, a journalist embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble. The search led to East Potomac Golf Links, where trucks were depositing soil confirmed to be from the White House grounds, potentially for a new golf hole. The reporter also traced trucks back to the White House perimeter and visited an industrial dump site in Maryland, where workers were tight-lipped. The article reflects on the tangible disappearance of a historic structure, noting that while the East Wing housed significant history, its remains can be crumbled and hauled away, with its ultimate destination remaining largely secret.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a decision that experts warn could impact U.S. consumer prices for goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The move was reportedly in response to a Canadian TV ad that used a 1987 Ronald Reagan speech to caution against high tariffs. This halt in talks could keep existing 35% tariffs on many Canadian goods and 50% levies on steel and aluminum in place for an extended period. Since Canada is the top exporter of steel and aluminum to the U.S., prolonged tariffs could increase manufacturing costs, which are often passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

While vote counting was still ongoing, Humphreys congratulated Connolly, stating she "will be a president for all of us." The presidency is a largely ceremonial role in Ireland. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and independent lawmaker, gained the backing of several left-leaning parties and has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza.

          <p>A new report reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo apartments resold between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold for a loss. The median price per square foot for these properties has remained largely flat for a decade, a stark contrast to the significant price increases seen in most of the U.S. When factoring in transaction costs, renovations, and inflation, the actual losses for sellers are likely even higher. The high-end market, however, has bucked this trend, with apartments sold for over $10 million consistently yielding profits, driven by wealthy, cash-based buyers who are less affected by economic cycles.
