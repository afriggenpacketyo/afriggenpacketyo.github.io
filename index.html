          <h2>Met Police Chief Urges Government to Increase Police Funding</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, along with other senior police chiefs, is calling on the government to provide substantial additional funding for policing in the upcoming spending review. In an article for the Times, Sir Mark and his colleagues highlight a decade of underinvestment and increasing pressures on police forces, which they say hinder their ability to meet government pledges on crime reduction. The police chiefs argue that without significant investment, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing or halving of knife crime and violence against women and girls, all of which are government promises. A Home Office spokesperson stated that the government is backing the police with up to Â£17.6bn this year, including funds for additional neighborhood police officers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns about the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to ease overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argue that the plans could negatively impact public safety, citing the costs of electronic tagging and the potential for repeat offenders to avoid jail time. The government maintains that their concerns have been addressed, with a Ministry of Justice spokesperson stating that sentencing reforms will ensure prisoners earn their release and the most dangerous offenders remain incarcerated. Head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley acknowledged the government had a difficult problem to fix on prison overcrowding.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7m penalty, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for violations related to sewage spills and shareholder payouts. Ofwat found that Thames Water routinely released untreated sewage, damaging the environment and posing health risks, and also issued undeserved dividends to shareholders. The penalty includes Â£104.5m for sewage operation breaches and Â£18.2m for improper shareholder payouts. This action follows ongoing criticism of Thames Water's performance and financial stability, as the company continues to grapple with a Â£20bn debt pile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed US embassies to temporarily suspend scheduling student visa appointments as it prepares to expand social media vetting of applicants. The move, outlined in an official memo, is part of a broader crackdown on universities accused of failing to combat antisemitism amid pro-Palestinian protests. China has urged the US to protect international students' rights in response to the policy. Critics argue that the social media vetting policy infringes on free speech, while the Trump administration asserts it is defending free speech and ensuring national security.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that fat cells may have a 'metabolic memory' of obesity, making it more difficult to keep weight off after losing it. Researchers found that fat cells in previously obese mice continued to exhibit unhealthy metabolic changes even after weight loss, including difficulty regulating sugar metabolism and increased inflammation. While biology plays a role, the expert cautioned that genetics, environment, psychology, and social factors also shape obesity. The study highlights the importance of healthy habits, such as physical activity and a balanced diet, to counteract genetic predispositions and improve metabolic health.</p>

Slotkin suggests that the party needs to prioritize economic issues over social issues and offer authentic, relatable solutions to the challenges faced by everyday Americans.

High home prices and rising mortgage rates have made housing unaffordable for many, and the ongoing tariff debate has created additional uncertainty for builders.

          <p>This article explores the historical shift of the word 'pride' from a negative connotation, associated with the seven deadly sins, to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment. The term gained prominence in the LGBTQ+ community following the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, with organizers choosing 'pride' over 'gay power' for its unifying and self-affirming message. Despite progress, the LGBTQ+ community continues to face challenges, including anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and corporate backlash, making 'pride' a relevant and powerful symbol today. The article highlights the complex history and ongoing significance of the word in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gila County, Arizona, a conservative area that heavily supported Trump, express mixed feelings about proposed Medicaid cuts, with many relying on the program for healthcare. While concerns about government waste are prevalent, many residents depend on Medicaid due to lower incomes and industries with limited health benefits. The proposed cuts, which include work requirements and increased paperwork, could reverse gains made by the Affordable Care Act. Some residents acknowledge the need for Medicaid while also believing it needs significant revamping due to perceived abuse.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has ceased abortions in Missouri after the state's Supreme Court ordered new rulings in a legal battle over an abortion ban previously overturned by voters. The court stated that a lower court judge did not adequately consider potential harms from allowing abortions to resume. Planned Parenthood, which operates the state's only abortion clinics, has canceled appointments and expressed frustration over the political interference. The state government is also pushing for a new ballot measure that would ban abortions with exceptions for pregnancies caused by sexual assault or incest.</p>

          <p>China has increased its naval presence in East Asian waters, deploying a large number of naval and coast guard vessels near Taiwan, the Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas. This heightened activity has caused concern among regional capitals, with security officials noting the exertion of pressure on the first island chain. Japan has been tracking the movements of the Liaoning aircraft carrier, and the Philippines has protested China's "illegal presence" in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use, leading to debate about drug policy. The London Drugs Commission's report suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and treating it as a controlled substance under the Psychoactive Substances Act. While Khan supports the report's findings, critics like David Raynes argue that decriminalization would send the wrong message about cannabis's harm. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force would continue to enforce current drug laws.</p>
