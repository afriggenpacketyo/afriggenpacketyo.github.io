          <p>Air Canada suspended its global operations after more than 10,000 flight attendants went on strike, leaving thousands of travelers stranded during the peak summer season. The strike began after contract negotiations over wages and unpaid work stalled, marking the first such action by the airline's flight attendants since 1985. In response to the significant economic and travel disruption, the Canadian government quickly intervened, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to compel a return to work.</p>

          <p>Six prominent Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner, have issued an open letter urging President Trump to reverse his decision allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI semiconductor chips to China. The senators argue that the deal, which involves the U.S. government receiving 15% of the sales revenue, trades away a critical technological advantage and poses a serious national security risk by potentially strengthening China's military capabilities. They have requested a detailed response from the administration regarding this and any similar arrangements.</p>

          <p>Sources familiar with the discussions at the Alaska summit claim Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine withdraw from the entirety of the Donetsk region. In exchange, Russia would allegedly halt its offensive operations in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. This demand for significant territorial concessions was reportedly relayed by President Trump to Ukrainian and European leaders, highlighting the stark terms being considered in negotiations to end the war.</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have triggered deadly flash floods across northern Pakistan and neighboring India, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people. In Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone, over 300 fatalities have been reported, with many victims swept away or killed in building collapses. Rescue efforts involving thousands of workers are being severely hampered by continued rainfall, landslides, and washed-out roads, with fears that many more people may still be trapped in the debris.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of books are being pulled from school library shelves across Florida as a new school year begins, continuing a trend of rising censorship in the state. The latest wave of removals follows a warning from the state board of education to the Hillsborough county district over allegedly "pornographic" titles, which prompted that district to pull over 600 books. Fearing similar government retaliation, at least nine other districts have proactively removed titles, a move critics call "state-driven censorship."</p>
