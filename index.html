Korda expressed satisfaction with her improved putting, while A Lim Kim noted her fondness for chasing the leader.

          <p>Brazil's environmental minister, Marina Silva, faced public attacks from senators seeking to advance economic projects, highlighting the vulnerability of the environmental movement. This comes after President Lula's administration sided with the oil industry, approving oil exploration near the Amazon. The senate passed a bill stripping environmental licensing powers from Silva's ministry, dubbed the 'devastation bill' by opponents. While Lula defended Silva after the attacks, his support for oil drilling and infrastructure projects contradicts his promise of zero deforestation by 2030, creating tension between environmental goals and economic interests.</p>

          <p>A new tax bill in the United States includes a levy on remittances, which are financial transfers made by individuals to their home countries. This tax is expected to significantly impact Africans who rely on these funds for essential expenses like healthcare, education, and household needs. Remittances represent a substantial portion of income for many African economies, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. Experts suggest that the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, thereby evading the tax but also creating unreliable data. </p>
