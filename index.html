          <p>The Air India plane crash involving a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner in Ahmedabad has intensified scrutiny on Boeing's safety record and the Dreamliner aircraft. The crash, the first of its kind for the 787-8, resulted in no known survivors and potential casualties on the ground. Investigations are underway, with U.S. safety officials assisting, to determine the cause of the crash. Boeing has faced previous safety concerns, including inspections ordered for cockpit seats and whistleblower allegations about assembly defects, adding to the pressure surrounding this incident. The crash prompts renewed examination of Boeing's manufacturing processes and safety protocols in the aviation industry. </p>

The timeline of events includes curfews implemented by Mayor Karen Bass due to vandalism and looting, clashes between protesters and law enforcement, and the deployment of National Guard troops. California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of the state's National Guard troops, citing a breach of state sovereignty.

          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused a significant rise in inflation, with recent data indicating benign consumer and producer prices. Several factors have contributed to keeping inflation in check, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff implementation. The delayed pass-through of tariffs into the real economy and reduced consumer pricing power are also contributing factors. Economists expect the impact of tariffs to materialize in the coming months, but for now, inflation remains relatively stable. </p>

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed diplomatic efforts with Trump, who stated Iran is expected to respond in the coming days. Steve Witkoff plans to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran in Oman. The UN's nuclear watchdog stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations, prompting Iranian condemnation. The US proposal seeks to prevent Iran from developing domestic enrichment of nuclear fuel, requiring them to procure it from outside the country. </p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are common investment vehicles for diversified portfolios, with both actively and passively managed options. ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices during trading hours, while mutual funds are purchased and sold directly at the end-of-day market price. ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds due to simpler transaction management. Investors should consult a fund's prospectus to understand its objectives, risks, fees, and performance history. Jim Cramer advocates for market beginners to invest their first $10,000 in an S&P 500 index mutual fund or ETF before selecting individual stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
