            <p>Clinical psychologist Diana Hill and movement specialist Katy Bowman suggest retraining the brain to crave physical activity for stress relief by using the concept of psychological flexibility. This involves acknowledging the urge to scroll, practicing 'urge surfing' by observing the craving without acting on it, and engaging in simple movements like stretching or dancing. Savoring enjoyable activities, adding novelty to familiar routines, and transforming worry into compassionate action can further reinforce the habit of choosing movement over sedentary screen time, ultimately boosting mood and well-being.</p>

            <p>Bangladeshi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for British MP Tulip Siddiq, who was accused of illegally receiving land as part of a probe into the regime of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina. The investigation stems from allegations that Hasina's family embezzled funds from infrastructure spending. Siddiq's lawyers deny the charges, claiming they are politically motivated and that no evidence has been presented. Siddiq had previously referred herself to the PM's ethics advisor, who found no evidence of improprieties but noted "potential reputational risks" from her ties to Hasina.</p>

            <p>Financial markets are experiencing a wider and more volatile sell-off than usual, raising concerns about the long-term impact of aggressive trade policies on the US economy. The S&P 500 has declined significantly since President Trump's tariff announcement, with other major US assets, including the dollar and Treasuries, also sliding. This has led to fears of a rotation out of US assets and a reassessment of the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari noted that the dollar's decline despite tariff increases suggests a change in investor preferences. (not investment advice)</p>

The government seeks to force Meta to unwind its purchase of both apps to restore competition. Meta counters that it is being punished for its innovation and success, and that the acquisitions were approved by regulators years ago.
