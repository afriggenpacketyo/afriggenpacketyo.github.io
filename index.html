          <p>On Sunday night, Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted, spewing lava fountains over 1,000 feet high.  This six-hour eruption, the 23rd since last December, prompted warnings about volcanic smog and Pele's hair, dangerous volcanic glass strands.  Authorities confirmed that the eruption posed no immediate threat to nearby communities, as all activity remained confined within a closed area of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park.  Scientists predict the possibility of further eruptions in the near future.</p>

          <p>The article challenges the widespread online belief that weightlifters need to consume one gram of protein per pound of body weight daily.  Expert sources refute this claim, stating that the benefits plateau around 0.73 grams per pound.  The article emphasizes that excessive protein intake can be counterproductive, promoting unnecessary dietary restrictions and potentially encouraging higher consumption of animal products.  It highlights the sufficiency of plant-based protein sources for muscle growth and advocates for a more balanced and sustainable approach to nutrition.</p>

          <p>ASML, a crucial semiconductor company, has experienced a significant decline in market value exceeding $130 billion in less than a year. This downturn is attributed to U.S. export restrictions on chips to China and ongoing tariff uncertainties.  Experts highlight the impact of these restrictions on equipment manufacturers in the semiconductor industry, along with concerns about over-investment in AI and potential unmet demand.  ASML's importance in the semiconductor supply chain, particularly with its advanced EUV machines, is emphasized.</p>

          <p>A research note from Oxford Economics projects an $8.5 billion decrease in spending from international tourists visiting the U.S. in 2025. This decline, estimated at around 5%, is attributed to a 9% drop in international arrivals.

          <p>A global study reveals a concerning trend of declining well-being among young adults (18-29), contradicting the traditional U-shaped happiness curve.  The study, using data from over 200,000 adults across 23 countries, shows that flourishing increases with age in many nations, including the U.S.  Researchers suggest factors such as decreased religious service attendance, reduced engagement in group activities, and the negative impacts of social media may contribute to this decline. Further research is needed to pinpoint the exact causes.</p>
