            <p>A new book, "Uncharted," claims that White House aides restricted former President Joe Biden's access to outside interactions, leading to a decline in his cognitive function. The book suggests that this strategy, intended to protect Biden from potential missteps, instead allowed his mental faculties to deteriorate due to lack of engagement. Critics and former aides have voiced concerns about Biden's mental acuity, particularly after his debate performance. The book recounts an ABC interview where Biden appeared "semi-coherent" prior to withdrawing from the presidential race.</p>

            <p>Investors are selling off U.S. government debt due to concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs and escalating trade war with China. Interest rates on U.S. debt have spiked, reaching levels not seen since February, signaling a decline in confidence in the U.S. economy. Some analysts suggest the Federal Reserve may need to intervene to stabilize the bond market. Economists warn of potential recession and the impact on global economy, particularly the UK, due to increased borrowing costs for companies and households (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The Justice Department has requested the Supreme Court to halt lower court rulings that invalidated President Trump's dismissal of members from the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the district court orders reinstating the members harm the president's executive power and the separation of powers. The administration seeks a stay of the decisions, contending that the president should not be forced to delegate power to agency heads who oppose his policy objectives.

            <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause in higher tariffs for most countries, maintaining a 10% baseline tariff across the board. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated this decision required “great courage” from the president. However, this pause does not apply to China, on which Trump is raising the U.S. tariff to 125%, citing China's unwillingness to make a deal. The move comes amid escalating trade tensions and concerns about the impact of tariffs on the global economy.</p>

            <p>President Trump has made several claims regarding U.S. trade, including the assertion that the U.S. is making $2 billion a day from tariffs and has a $1 trillion deficit with China.

Trump also claimed Canada charges 270% on U.S. dairy products, which is only true under specific conditions when quotas are exceeded.</p>

            <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is expanding its presence in Europe by launching its premium brand, Denza, despite increasing trade tensions. The first model, the Z9GT, is expected to arrive in European showrooms in the fourth quarter of 2025. The Z9GT will be available in both battery-only and plug-in hybrid versions. This expansion comes as the European Union has announced duties on imports of BYD electric vehicles over claims of unfair production subsidies.</p>

            <p>Canada's 25% auto tariffs have taken effect on U.S.-produced vehicles and many parts, differing from U.S. tariffs in several ways. Canada carved out individual auto parts from the tariffs and is considering the USMCA trade deal. There is a remissions process that could provide companies some relief from the duties. The tariffs are on vehicles from the U.S. that are not compliant with the USMCA, as well as non-Canadian and non-Mexican content of USMCA-compliant fully assembled vehicles imported into Canada from the U.S.</p>

The study analyzed data from over 108,000 participants and identified two clusters of additives commonly found in creamy dairy desserts, sugary drinks, and artificially sweetened beverages. The research suggests that consuming these additives may contribute to diabetes risk, regardless of the diet's nutritional quality.
