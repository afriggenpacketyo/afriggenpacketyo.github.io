        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially released a new schedule of tariffs, set to take effect in one week, impacting nearly 70 countries with rates from 10% to 41%. The executive order confirms previously announced rates for some nations and sets new ones for others, largely based on trade deficits. For instance, Laos and Myanmar face 40% tariffs, while countries not explicitly listed will have a 10% duty. This move follows a period of intense negotiations after the administration delayed its 'Liberation Day' tariffs, aiming to secure more favorable trade deals for the U.S.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the new U.S. tariff schedule, which offered lower rates than initially feared. Cambodia's prime minister praised the reduction from 49% to 19% as beneficial for his country's economy, while Thailand's finance minister noted its 19% rate reflects a strong U.S. partnership. Taiwan faces a temporary 20% tariff, down from 32%, with its president expressing hope for further reductions through ongoing negotiations. Japan and Malaysia also saw their rates lowered, providing some economic stability, though officials remain prepared to mitigate potential impacts on local businesses.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's National Assembly, controlled by President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party, has approved constitutional amendments allowing for indefinite presidential reelection and extending the presidential term from five to six years. The changes were passed with a supermajority vote, solidifying Bukele's power. Bukele, who is immensely popular due to his aggressive crackdown on street gangs, had already won a second term despite a previous constitutional ban. Opposition lawmakers condemned the move as the death of democracy in the country, warning of an unchecked accumulation of power.</p>

          <p>In her first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is currently 'broken.' She explained her recent decision not to run for California governor stemmed from a desire to step away from the system for now, though she affirmed her commitment to continue fighting for democratic principles. Harris stated that while she has faith in public servants, the systems themselves are not as strong as they need to be to defend fundamental principles. The interview took place amid speculation about the political motivations for the announced cancellation of Colbert's show.</p>

The Chargers' defense also made key plays, including an early interception by rookie Nikko Reed that set up a touchdown. While mistakes are common in the first preseason game, the Lions struggled with multiple fumbles on special teams, giving the Chargers a dominant start to their 2025 campaign.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who were facing the loss of legal status and deportation protections. In her order, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to prove the administration's decision was 'preordained' and potentially motivated by racial animus, citing comments from the president. TPS is a program that offers temporary safe haven to immigrants from countries affected by conflict or disaster.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old woman, Jeny Morenoparra, was arrested for allegedly attempting to bring fentanyl into a Los Angeles juvenile hall while visiting her child. Authorities state that a probation officer discovered her with over 30 fentanyl pills during a visit in 2023. After being released while the case was under review, the L.A. County District Attorney reopened the case, leading to her recent re-arrest. She now faces multiple felony charges, including bringing an illegal substance into a jail facility. The incident highlights ongoing safety concerns at the facility, which was recently deemed 'unsuitable' for housing youths.</p>

The change comes as universities face significant financial pressures from high inflation and a decline in international student enrollment, with many institutions projecting deficits. Student advocacy groups have warned that maintenance loans barely cover average rent costs, forcing a majority of students to take on part-time employment to afford living expenses.</p>

General Manager Perry Minasian defended the strategy, stating it was important for the team's young core to play meaningful, competitive games in August and September to aid their development. Critics argue the team could have traded soon-to-be free agents to address future needs, but the front office opted to give the current roster a chance to compete, despite the organization's 10-year playoff drought.</p>

The original $21 billion fund was created in 2019 to protect utilities from bankruptcy after their equipment sparked catastrophic fires.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has revealed that the modern potato evolved from an ancient ancestor of the tomato around 9 million years ago. Researchers solved the long-standing puzzle of the potato's origin by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes. They found that a hybridization event between a non-tuber-producing Chilean species and an ancient tomato provided the crucial genetic combination for tuber formation. A specific gene from the tomato ancestor signals the plant to create tubers, while a gene from the other parent helps control their growth, demonstrating how interbreeding can spark new evolutionary traits.</p>

While third-country deportations can be legal, they require that the destination country is safe and that migrants have due process to challenge their removal.

          <p>In the first federal trial of its kind, attorneys for plaintiffs have asked a jury to award $345 million in damages against Tesla for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system that resulted in a fatality. The incident occurred when a Tesla owner, believing the system would automatically brake, accelerated through an intersection and struck a parked car, killing 22-year-old Naibel Benavides. The plaintiffs argue that Tesla's marketing overstated the system's capabilities, leading to driver over-reliance. Tesla's defense contends that the driver was at fault and that a ruling against the company would stifle life-saving technological development.</p>

          <p>Two senior U.S. officials, special envoy Steve Witkoff and ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are set to make a rare visit to a food distribution site in Gaza. The visit comes amid growing international concern over a humanitarian crisis that aid workers have described as a 'politically manmade famine.' President Trump has expressed frustration that aid is not reaching Palestinians, blaming Hamas for intercepting supplies. The visit is seen as a reflection of the administration's increasing focus on the dire situation, as Israel faces mounting pressure to allow more aid into the territory.</p>

          <p>Amazon posted better-than-expected revenue and profit for its second quarter, with sales rising 13% to $167.7 billion. However, the stock fell in after-hours trading as investors were underwhelmed by the modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, and a mixed forecast for the upcoming quarter. While AWS growth was slightly slower than rivals, CEO Andy Jassy cited supply constraints, particularly access to power, as a key challenge for meeting AI demand. The company plans to increase capital expenditures for the rest of the year to support its cloud and logistics networks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of teenagers are using caffeine pouches, small teabag-like products placed in the mouth for a quick stimulant rush, raising concerns among health experts. Influencers on social media are promoting the pouches for gym performance and studying, but with some containing as much caffeine as two cups of coffee, there is a risk of overdose. Experts warn that high levels of caffeine can cause rapid heart rate and seizures, and that young people are particularly vulnerable. The discreet nature of the pouches makes them easy to hide, and there are worries they could be a gateway to nicotine products.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a significant surge in Chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne illness, with over 5,000 cases reported since last month, primarily in the southern province of Guangdong. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now considering issuing a travel notice for the country due to the rising infections. Chikungunya is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and its most common symptoms are fever and severe joint pain, though it can also cause headaches, muscle pain, and rashes. The outbreak highlights the ongoing risk of vector-borne diseases in the region.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major cities that have long been economic powerhouses for China's Guangdong province, are reporting slower GDP growth compared to their peers. Analysts attribute the slowdown to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and insufficient domestic demand to compensate. Shenzhen's economy has been particularly affected, with significant year-on-year drops in fixed-asset investment and real estate development, signaling a decline in investor confidence. While the city's hi-tech sector grew, its overall trade and exports have fallen, prompting calls for stronger government action to revive business activity.</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has revealed that he was battling a 'relentlessly debilitating' case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. In a social media post, the 44-year-old singer explained that the diagnosis helped him understand the severe nerve pain and fatigue he was experiencing on stage. Lyme disease is a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks, with symptoms that can include joint pain, fever, and muscle aches. Despite the health challenges and a recent DWI charge, Timberlake chose to continue the tour, stating he was glad he pushed through the experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change is part of a ministerial drive to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves. Eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program for the civil service. The move aims to address the underrepresentation of working-class individuals in Whitehall and ensure a broader range of talent is harnessed for government work.</p>
