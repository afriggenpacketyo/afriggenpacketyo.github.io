            <p>President Trump indicated the US might withdraw from brokering peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if progress isn't swiftly achieved, echoing Secretary of State Rubio's concerns. Trump emphasized the urgency due to ongoing casualties and threatened to label either party as 'foolish' if they obstruct a deal. This statement follows stalled ceasefire attempts, with both sides blamed by Washington. Despite this, Vice-President Vance expressed optimism about ending the war during a meeting with Italy's Prime Minister, while the US and Ukraine advanced a minerals deal, aiming to finalize it by April 26 for Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>

            <p>Governor Gavin Newsom granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation, prior to Easter. Bin, a former gang member convicted of shooting at a rival's home, was pardoned due to his rehabilitation and ministry work in prison. Newsom's action aligns with his criticism of the Trump administration's immigration policies and past efforts to aid immigrants facing deportation. The governor also issued a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, whose later crimes were contextualized by his service-related PTSD.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily halted a lower court's investigation into whether the Trump administration acted in criminal contempt by defying an order to halt deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The appeals court's order doesn't rule on the merits of the inquiry but sets deadlines for legal filings. The initial order was issued by District Court Judge James Boasberg, who found probable cause that the administration defied his order to return the deportation flights, even after the Supreme Court allowed the deportations to resume.</p>

            <p>Recent volatility in the US bond market, with rising interest rates and falling bond prices, indicates investor concern about the US economy. Investors typically view government bonds as safe, but uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs has led to a sell-off. This can affect ordinary Americans through higher borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and car loans, and can impact businesses' access to credit. The bond market's reaction to tariffs prompted Trump to pause tariff increases, demonstrating its influence. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Artists and creatives are expressing concern over the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate images, particularly the trend of creating "starter pack" images of people as toys. They fear that AI-generated art devalues creativity and may threaten their livelihoods. The #StarterPackNoAI movement has emerged as a counter-trend, with artists creating their own versions to highlight the value of human-made art. While some acknowledge the potential usefulness of AI, many worry about its impact on intellectual property rights and the originality of artistic expression.</p>

            <p>White House border czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmer Abrego Garcia, alleging he is a violent MS-13 gang member, despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return. Homan claimed the administration doesn't have the ability to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., arguing he is under El Salvador's authority. He also criticized Senator Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia, while the senator's office stated the trip was funded with bipartisan approval to conduct oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs.</p>

            <p>A doctor in Gaza describes the dire conditions facing the healthcare system, exacerbated by ongoing conflict and blockades. Limited resources, including fuel and medical supplies, make it difficult to treat patients, especially displaced individuals living in shelters.

The doctor expresses concern over the collapse of the healthcare system, the inability to refer complicated cases, and the challenges of securing basic necessities for her own children.</p>

            <p>President Trump is reportedly studying the possibility of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to an economic advisor. Trump has publicly criticized Powell's performance and the Fed's interest rate policies. While the Fed chair is meant to be an independent role, the administration is exploring potential avenues for removal. The possibility of replacing Powell with a more hawkish figure like Kevin Warsh is also being considered, though Warsh has advised against removing Powell before the end of his term.</p>
