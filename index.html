          <p>The United States and Iran have commenced in-depth negotiations in Oman concerning Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment limits in exchange for sanctions relief. These talks, led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, involve experts from both sides and seek to de-escalate tensions that have persisted since the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. President Trump, attending Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, expressed hope for a new deal while also considering military options if negotiations fail. The Iranian rial has shown signs of recovery, reflecting some optimism within Iran regarding the potential success of these discussions.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the Trump administration's proposal for a "Golden Dome" missile defense shield to counter China's expanding arsenal faces significant challenges and high costs. The system, potentially involving a partnership between SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril, would require launching hundreds of satellites to detect and track missiles, as well as attack satellites to intercept them. Despite initial reports, Elon Musk has denied SpaceX's involvement. The project raises questions about its feasibility and potential complexities, even as Boeing is reportedly working to have its products used in the Golden Dome.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is projected to lose billions of dollars in tourism revenue due to the Trump administration's policies, which are deterring overseas visitors. The number of international visitors has significantly dropped, particularly from Western Europe and Canada, due to concerns about safety and perceived antipathy towards foreigners. This decline is expected to worsen, costing the tourism industry an estimated $10 billion this year, as Trump's stance on immigration and trade wars impacts travel behavior. Both Democratic and Republican states are expected to be affected, as key markets like Canada and Europe reduce travel to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Mexican drug cartels are increasingly using social media platforms like TikTok and X to broadcast their activities, shape their public image, and expand their reach.

          <p>Aimee Semple McPherson, a religious innovator, is described as Los Angeles' founding godmother of reinvention, arriving in 1918 with "10 dollars and a tambourine" to build her platform. She founded the Angelus Temple, America's first megachurch, and started one of the first Christian radio stations, combining theatrical spectacle with the gospel. Despite scandals, including a mysterious disappearance and subsequent trial, McPherson's life and showmanship solidified Los Angeles' allure as a place for revival, second chances, and spiritual transformation. The article highlights her understanding that faith, fame, and spectacle were a potent mix for success, influencing the city's spiritual landscape.</p>

          <p>Dunsmuir, California, is struggling to provide legal public access to Mossbrae Falls, a natural wonder that could significantly boost the town's economy. Despite its proximity to the city, the falls are only accessible via trespassing along active train tracks, posing safety risks to the estimated 30,000 annual visitors. Efforts to create a safe hiking trail have been hindered by property rights issues with the Saint Germain Foundation and bureaucratic challenges with Union Pacific Railroad. City officials are now leading the effort to negotiate with landowners and secure funding for a trail that would connect the city park to the falls.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office is embroiled in a leak investigation that has led to the firing of three senior aides, allegedly fueled by interpersonal conflicts. The investigation centers on the disclosure of a classified document outlining military options for reclaiming the Panama Canal. Internal rivalries between Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, and the ousted aides, including Dan Caldwell, have complicated the situation, leaving senior officials struggling to discern the truth. The tensions highlight Hegseth's inexperience and the challenges of managing the Pentagon amidst distrust and internal divisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article presents a left-wing argument for space exploration, countering the view that it is a distraction from terrestrial issues. It asserts that space science is crucial for addressing ecological and social crises, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and disease outbreaks. Space-based remote sensing enables monitoring of deforestation, agricultural water use, and greenhouse gas emissions, while precision agriculture can reduce the environmental impact of farming. The piece advocates for public-sector-led space programs and regulations to mitigate negative externalities like satellite pollution, arguing that space-faring is essential for humanity's progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual White House correspondents' dinner faces diminished enthusiasm this year due to the absence of President Trump, the withdrawal of comedian Amber Ruffin, and concerns about the media's response to Trump's tactics. Critics view the event as a somber reflection of the legacy media's struggles in the face of Trump's attacks and the rise of right-wing media. The decision to drop Ruffin, who had made critical remarks about the Trump administration, is seen by some as an act of cowardice and a symbol of the media's failure to unite against Trump's assault on truth.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a surge in cocaine use, driven by factors such as a saturated North American market and a decline in heroin availability due to the Taliban's opium ban. The drug, now easily accessible via messenger services, is spreading across all social classes, leading to serious health consequences and rising drug-related deaths. North Sea ports like Hamburg are key hubs for drug smuggling from South America, particularly from Ecuador, where drug cartels exploit logistics and infrastructure to transport cocaine to Europe. The article highlights the need for a concerted approach involving prevention, help, and strict law enforcement to combat the growing problem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes how President Trump's cabinet appointees often appear to be performing roles rather than effectively executing their responsibilities, creating a "Cosplay Cabinet." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are cited as examples, engaging in public displays and social media posts that emphasize a certain type of MAGA masculinity. Critics argue that this focus on image distracts from actual governance and raises questions about the qualifications of these officials. The piece suggests that Trump, himself a cosplayer, values those who can embody the roles he envisions for them, even if it comes at the expense of competence.</p>

This denial follows repeated claims by Trump that he has spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the issue, adding to a cycle of conflicting statements between the two countries.

          <p>A Durham University study has found that chimpanzees exhibit similar levels of empathy as bonobos, despite being typically characterized as more violent. Researchers observed chimpanzees consoling each other through behaviors like embracing and hand-holding, similar to humans. The study, involving 1,400 hours of observation across bonobos and chimpanzees, suggests that emotional sensitivity emerges early in ape development. The findings challenge previous assumptions about chimpanzee behavior and could provide insights into the evolution of human social behavior.</p>
