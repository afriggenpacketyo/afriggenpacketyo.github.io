          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have signed a significant free trade agreement designed to boost exports and create jobs in both countries. Under the deal, tariffs will be reduced on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports such as textiles to the UK. The agreement also includes enhanced cooperation on tackling illegal migration, defense, and technology. While the UK government projects a £4.8 billion annual boost to its economy, some critics have raised concerns about potential impacts on British workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least twelve people, primarily civilians, have been killed in escalating armed clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops along their disputed border. The fighting, which involved gunfire, rockets, and air strikes, marks a serious escalation of a century-old territorial dispute. Both nations have provided conflicting accounts of who initiated the conflict, leading to border closures and the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians from the area. The long-standing tensions, often centered on an 11th-century temple, have now plunged bilateral relations to a new low.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food giant Nestle has indicated that prices for products like KitKat and Nespresso may rise further in the latter half of the year. The company cites historically high costs for key commodities such as coffee and cocoa, with potential U.S. tariffs adding to the pressure on its profit margins. Despite better-than-expected sales growth in the first half, driven by previous price hikes, Nestle's total reported sales declined slightly. The company is also conducting a strategic review of some underperforming vitamin brands as part of a broader simplification effort. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite death's inevitability, many Americans find it the most difficult taboo topic to discuss, leading to a lack of end-of-life planning. This cultural avoidance, which has roots in the 19th-century professionalization of the funeral industry, has significant consequences, as fewer than half of U.S. adults have a will. The article explores how this silence impacts grieving and decision-making for families. However, there are signs of change, with growing interest in death doulas and more open cultural conversations aiming to make dying a more transparent and less feared process.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles has filed a lawsuit against Tesla, accusing the company of false advertising by misleading consumers about its vehicles' autonomous driving capabilities. The state argues that features marketed as "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving" do not make the cars fully autonomous as implied. California is seeking to suspend Tesla's sales in the state, which would be a significant blow as it represents a large portion of the company's U.S. market. Tesla defends its statements as "puffery" and notes it has always included warnings that active driver supervision is required. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's policy of deporting convicted criminals to Afghanistan is under scrutiny following a recent flight carrying 81 Afghan men. The German government, which does not officially recognize the Taliban regime, is pursuing a "repatriation offensive" but faces criticism due to the dire humanitarian and human rights situation in Afghanistan. To facilitate these deportations, Germany has engaged in "technical contacts" with the Taliban, mediated by Qatar, and will allow Afghan representatives to be based in Berlin. Critics argue the policy is inhumane and damages Germany's international credibility.</p>

The EU has become increasingly concerned about China's export of excess industrial supply, leading to tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and subsequent anti-dumping probes from Beijing.

While acknowledging the severe health risks, the writer argues that the act of smoking can feel like a defiant pause and a reclaiming of control.
