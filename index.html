Kroger is focusing on simplifying promotions, reducing prices on over 2,000 products, and highlighting its private brands to cater to value-conscious shoppers. Despite facing competition from Walmart and Costco, Kroger remains optimistic about its growth, particularly in e-commerce and its Simple Truth organic line.

While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer supported the measure, concerns remain among critics about potential coercion, although proponents insist on sufficient safeguards. Supporters emphasize the bill's potential to protect terminally ill patients from undignified deaths, while opponents fear the impact on vulnerable individuals, highlighting the need for high-quality end-of-life care.</p>

          <p>An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS allowing the taxpayer to resolve their tax debt for a lower amount than what is owed. The IRS considers factors like the taxpayer's ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity to determine eligibility. Applying for an OIC involves submitting detailed financial information and meeting specific criteria, such as filing all required tax returns and not being in bankruptcy. While an OIC can provide substantial relief for those facing financial hardship due to tax debt, the IRS has strict standards and thorough evaluation processes for approval.

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the 2020 election, reiterating his unfounded claims of widespread fraud. Trump's demand comes amidst a foreign policy decision regarding potential involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. Despite numerous court rulings and investigations finding no evidence of fraud that could have altered the election outcome, Trump continues to assert that the election was stolen. The Justice Department has previously appointed special counsels to investigate politically sensitive matters, including conduct by both Biden and Trump.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin asserted that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, implying that "the whole of Ukraine is ours," while also suggesting Russia might seize the city of Sumy. Despite this claim, Putin stated Russia recognizes Ukraine's sovereignty but noted its declaration of neutrality in 1991. He explained that Russian forces are establishing a buffer zone in the Sumy region to protect Russian territory, leaving open the possibility of taking control of the regional capital. Kyiv and its Western allies have condemned Moscow's claims to Ukrainian regions as illegal.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan to accelerate drug reviews for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." This initiative aims to reduce drug review times to one to two months, allowing companies to submit drug applications before final clinical trial results are available. The FDA plans to prioritize companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While this plan could benefit the pharmaceutical industry, concerns remain about the risks of fast-tracking drug reviews and potential political influences.</p>

While ideally investors will have a mix of precious metals in their portfolio encompassing both gold and silver, silver can be a more attractive one for certain investors because the entry price point is much lower and you'll still hedge against inflation and diversify your portfolio. Silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce this week, according to American Hartford Gold. Investors may find that silver is worth a second look now. (not investment advice)</p>
