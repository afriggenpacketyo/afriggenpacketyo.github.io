          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a controversial Republican-backed bill to redraw the state's congressional districts, sending the measure to Governor Greg Abbott for his expected signature. The plan, which aims to create five new GOP-leaning districts, was a key priority for Republicans and prompted a weekslong standoff when House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. In response to the Texas effort, California Governor Gavin Newsom has initiated a counter-plan to redraw his state's map to favor Democrats, framing it as a necessary action to combat partisan gerrymandering.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were both denied parole after separate hearings, with commissioners citing their behavior while incarcerated rather than the 1989 murders of their parents. The parole boards highlighted numerous infractions, including involvement in fights, drug use, and the prohibited use of mobile phones, which they argued demonstrated a continued struggle with rule-breaking and antisocial traits. Erik Menendez stated he saw his parents 'as one person' due to his mother's awareness of his father's abuse, while both brothers expressed profound remorse for their actions during the hearings.</p>

          <p>An investigation has found that users on the popular gaming platform Roblox are bypassing moderation systems to spread hate speech, including swastikas and racist slurs, particularly within the game "Spray Paint!". Despite Roblox's statements about its 24/7 monitoring and safety features, harmful content remains accessible to its large user base, over half of whom are children and teens. The platform is facing numerous lawsuits and scrutiny from state attorneys general over allegations that it prioritizes growth over child safety, allowing it to be a space for predators and extremist recruitment.</p>

          <p>Multiple national postal services across Europe, including those in Germany, France, and the U.K., are suspending merchandise shipments to the United States due to new import duties signed into law by President Trump. The new rules, effective August 29, subject most international goods valued under $800 to tariffs, a category previously exempt. European postal operators cite a lack of clarity on the new regulations and insufficient time to update their systems, forcing them to halt services to ensure packages are not caught in limbo when the duties take effect.

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza, including in areas with tents sheltering displaced people, as a new report from a global food crisis authority declared that famine is now present in Gaza City. The famine determination has intensified international calls for Israel to halt its offensive, which was initiated after the Hamas attacks of October 2023. Israel has denounced the report as false while continuing preparations for a major military operation in Gaza City, and ceasefire negotiations remain stalled as mediators await Israel's response.</p>

Authorities allege that Adrian Guerrero, a U.S. citizen, threatened to stab an officer and harm his family while also slashing the tire of a government vehicle during the confrontation. The incident, which left four agents with minor injuries, is part of what Department of Homeland Security officials describe as a significant nationwide increase in assaults on immigration enforcement officers.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Zoo is grieving the loss of three beloved, long-serving animals—a polar bear, a giraffe, and a gorilla—all of whom died within a single week. Kalluk, a 24-year-old polar bear, and Nicky, a 28-year-old giraffe believed to be the oldest in North America, were both euthanized due to declining health. Days later, Maka, a 30-year-old Western lowland gorilla, died from a cardiac event during a medical examination. The nearly simultaneous deaths of these fan-favorite animals have been described as a deeply challenging and emotional time for the zoo's staff.</p>

          <p>A former elementary school teacher in Sacramento, Kim Kenneth Wilson, has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to multiple felony counts of lewd acts upon a child. Wilson used his position as the head of a campus broadcast club to groom and sexually assault numerous students over several years, often filming the crimes in a soundproof room at the school. The investigation uncovered a vast collection of recordings and other disturbing materials at his home, leading to his conviction and a multi-million dollar civil settlement.</p>

          <p>In South Africa's coal-rich Mpumalanga province, thousands of unemployed individuals, known as zama zamas, risk their lives in abandoned mines to illegally extract coal. Facing extreme dangers like tunnel collapses, toxic gas, and underground fires, these miners provide an essential fuel source for local communities that lack reliable electricity. Despite the risks and being labeled as criminals by the government, the miners operate out of economic desperation, highlighting a legacy of industrial mining that has enriched companies while leaving local populations in poverty and with a polluted environment.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, sending fountains of lava shooting up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 31st eruptive episode since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to homes. The spectacle is visible from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, attracting visitors to witness the event, which scientists attribute to magma building up in a lower chamber and being forced to the surface through established vents, creating dramatic displays.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has released 300 pages of transcripts from an interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, in which she discussed her relationships with Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump, and Prince Andrew. Maxwell stated that while Trump and Epstein were friendly, she never witnessed any inappropriate behavior from the former president. She also dismissed the existence of a high-profile "client list" as a conspiracy theory and claimed, contrary to Prince Andrew's account, that she did not introduce him to Epstein, suggesting Sarah Ferguson was responsible for the introduction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Utility bills are rising across the United States, with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the past year. Experts attribute the price hikes primarily to a surge in energy demand driven by the expansion of AI data centers, oil and gas drilling, and electrified transportation, rather than a shift to renewables as President Trump has claimed. The nation's power grid is struggling to keep up, with a major bottleneck in transmitting new energy, 95% of which is from solar, wind, and battery storage projects awaiting connection.

          <p>Applications for the T visa, a form of relief for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, have sharply increased, but so have processing times and the risk of deportation for those denied. The visa allows survivors to remain in the U.S. if they assist law enforcement, but median processing times have grown from six months in 2014 to nearly 20 months today. While a new process grants applicants earlier access to benefits, policy changes allowing for removal proceedings upon denial have heightened fear among survivors, who face a difficult choice in seeking legal status.</p>

          <p>In the wake of recent devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, residents are taking soil cleanup into their own hands amid concerns about contamination from burned structures. With government agencies declining to fund widespread soil testing, community workshops are teaching methods like bioremediation, which uses plants, fungi, and minerals to trap or break down toxins like lead and heavy metals. This approach empowers residents who worry about the safety of their yards and home gardens, offering an alternative to the conventional method of simply removing and landfilling the topsoil.</p>

Onboard, signs pointed to a sudden disappearance, with a half-drunk coffee and unfinished breakfast left behind. After an extensive search yielded no results, the Coast Guard suspended its efforts, leaving friends to suspect a "freak occurrence" caused him to fall overboard.</p>

The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department now believes the infant is deceased and is actively searching for his remains. The case drew national attention after the mother, Rebecca Haro, gave an emotional plea for her son's return, but authorities state that she provided contradictory statements and subsequently stopped cooperating, leading to the couple's arrest at their Cabazon home.</p>
