          <p>This article details the case of Alison Davis, who was charged with murdering her husband, Kevin. Prosecutors alleged she used a blunt object and then confined their protective dog, Willow, in the bedroom to prevent police from finding the weapon. Despite the detective's strong suspicions, no weapon was ever found, and a jury acquitted Alison Davis after only six hours of deliberation, citing a lack of evidence. The case leaves lingering questions for law enforcement and the victim's family, while Alison tries to rebuild her life.</p>

          <p>A prolonged U.S. government shutdown could severely impact air travel, even though most FAA and TSA employees are deemed essential. Experts warn that if the shutdown continues, these employees, who are forced to work without pay, may begin calling in sick or seeking other jobs, leading to significant labor shortages. This could result in longer security lines and flight delays, similar to disruptions seen during the 2018-2019 shutdown. The travel industry anticipates potential economic losses of up to $1 billion per week.</p>

          <p>With the onset of a government shutdown, active-duty U.S. military members are required to continue serving without receiving their pay until a funding agreement is reached. While civilian defense employees deemed "essential" will also work, others face furloughs. Although a 2019 law guarantees back pay for government employees after a shutdown, military pay requires separate legislation, which has not yet passed. Financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering no-interest loans to affected service members to help mitigate financial hardship.</p>

          <p>Social Security and SSI benefit payments will continue uninterrupted during the government shutdown, as they are funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will furlough a portion of its staff, which will halt or delay other crucial services. These disruptions include benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards. Furthermore, the shutdown could postpone the annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) announcement, as it depends on inflation data from the currently closed Labor Department.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a home mortgage in Virginia. The indictment was brought by a U.S. attorney appointed by President Trump, who had publicly called for charges against James following her successful civil fraud case against his company. The charges allege James misrepresented the use of a property to secure a more favorable mortgage rate, resulting in "ill-gotten gains" of about $19,000. James has called the indictment a "baseless" act of political retribution and a "weaponization" of the justice system.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, federal workers, both those furloughed and those working without pay, are voicing significant concerns about their financial stability and the disruption to public services. An attorney for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) expressed anxiety over accruing debt, noting many federal employees have limited savings. Another NLRB employee highlighted that the shutdown halts investigations into unfair labor practices, denying justice to workers. A Department of Veterans Affairs employee described the situation as a "moral injury" that compounds stress and undermines the dignity of public service.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation, forcing federal agencies to cease all non-essential operations. While essential services like national security, law enforcement, and air traffic control continue, the employees performing them must work without pay until funding is restored. Other "non-essential" federal employees are furloughed, and although a 2019 law guarantees them back pay, the immediate financial strain is significant. The disruption can affect a wide range of public services, from national parks to customer service at agencies like the SSA, with economic consequences growing the longer the shutdown lasts.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen for the third straight month, reflecting growing concerns over the economic impact of the government shutdown, inflation, and a hiring slowdown. The University of Michigan's survey indicates that shopper attitudes are worsening, a trend that began after President Trump took office. A government shutdown typically erodes consumer confidence, which can lead to a subsequent drop in consumer spending, a critical component of the U.S. economy. This decline in sentiment comes at a precarious time, with the shutdown halting the release of key federal economic data, including jobs and inflation reports. (not investment advice)</p>

The fees are tiered, with the highest penalties for vessels owned by Chinese entities and a lower tier for non-Chinese carriers operating Chinese-built ships. This move, part of broader trade tensions, has also prompted China to enact retaliatory fees on U.S.-flagged vessels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the stalking trial of Julia Wandelt, a woman who claims she is Madeleine McCann, the missing girl's great-aunt described being "stunned" by an encounter at a vigil. Janet Kennedy, who organizes the annual event, testified that Ms. Wandelt approached her and tried to hand her an envelope containing information she claimed would prove her identity. The court also heard that Ms. Wandelt and her co-defendant, Karen Spragg, later bombarded Kate and Gerry McCann with calls. Police have previously investigated Ms. Wandelt's claims and informed her she is not Madeleine.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly become a dominant force in the clothing retail industry, with its annual apparel sales growing nearly 40% since 2019 to an estimated $9.7 billion. This sales figure surpasses that of established apparel retailers like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The warehouse club's success is driven by offering popular brands such as Columbia and Gap alongside its own Kirkland Signature private label. A key part of its appeal is the "treasure hunt" shopping experience, where opportunistic purchases of brand-name overstocks create a constantly changing, limited-selection inventory that excites customers.</p>

          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the biggest mistake young investors make is being overly cautious and worrying more about potential losses than long-term gains. He argues that young people, with decades of time for their investments to compound, should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding significant amounts in cash or bonds. Historically, stocks have outperformed other asset classes over long periods, making them essential for building wealth. For beginners, Brown recommends starting with low-cost, broad-market index funds or ETFs. (not investment advice)</p>

This legal challenge follows his dismissal in July after an internal report upheld numerous allegations about his conduct.

Similar tactics, including the use of armored vehicles and flashbangs against crowds and observers, were documented in California.

          <p>Contrary to the administration's narrative, historical data and economic studies suggest that mass deportations harm the U.S. economy and native-born workers. The argument that removing an immigrant worker frees up a job for an American is a fallacy; in reality, it often leads to business contraction and job losses for citizens as well. Studies of past events show that reducing the immigrant labor force did not raise wages or employment for native workers. Instead, a robust immigrant workforce often spurs investment, innovation, and allows native workers to move into higher-skilled, better-paying jobs.</p>
