          <p>A high-level Chinese official visited Nepal to promote the trans-Himalayan project, emphasizing increased investment in areas like agriculture, new energy, and health. This diplomatic effort is part of China's broader strategy to enhance its influence in the region and win over partners like Nepal, which has traditionally been allied with India. In recent years, Beijing has significantly boosted its economic engagement with the landlocked nation through major infrastructure investments, drawing it closer into its sphere of influence.</p>

          <p>Sean Green, a 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, has achieved the monumental feat of cycling down all 282 of Scotland's Munros, which are mountains over 3,000 feet. The epic challenge, which involved carrying his bike to each summit before riding down, took him eight and a half years to complete. He is believed to be only the second person in history to accomplish this, combining his love for the outdoors with extreme cycling in a quest that tested both his physical endurance and logistical planning.</p>

          <p>A study by the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles reveals that many Mexican citizens detained in recent immigration raids are not recent arrivals but have deep roots in the United States. Based on interviews with 330 detainees, the report found that over half had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade, and more than a third had been there for over 20 years. Furthermore, nearly one-third of those interviewed have U.S.-born children, challenging prevailing narratives and highlighting the profound family and community ties affected by enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport is reportedly planning to construct a dedicated "repatriation terminal" by 2028 to streamline the process of deporting migrants with rejected asylum claims or criminal convictions. The plan is backed by conservative politicians who advocate for stricter enforcement, arguing it is a sensible measure. However, the proposal has drawn criticism from others, including the local Green Party, who are critical of creating a specific terminal solely for deportations, highlighting a political divide on immigration policy.</p>

          <p>New evidence from a New Orleans court case shows that the late Jesuit leader Pedro Arrupe, currently a candidate for Catholic sainthood, was explicitly warned about a priest, Donald J. Dickerson, who had been accused of sexually molesting minors. Despite these warnings in the 1970s, Arrupe did not prevent Dickerson's ordination, and the priest was later accused of sexually assaulting other children. These revelations have prompted calls to halt Arrupe's canonization process and have cast a new light on institutional failures within the Jesuit order to address clergy abuse.</p>

          <p>This article explores how state governments, such as Utah's, are increasingly passing laws that override local zoning rules to compel cities to build more affordable and denser housing. This top-down approach aims to tackle a nationwide housing shortage but often clashes with local opposition from residents concerned about overcrowding and loss of community character. The piece highlights the tension between the urgent need for housing and the principle of local control, illustrating the human cost of the crisis through the story of a young couple priced out of their hometown.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day can significantly reduce the risk of major health problems, including dementia, heart disease, and various cancers. This finding presents a more attainable goal for many people than the widely promoted but less scientific benchmark of 10,000 steps. Researchers believe this evidence-based target could motivate more individuals to track their activity as a practical method for improving long-term health outcomes.</p>

          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has canceled thousands of scheduled water pollution tests in the last three months due to severe staff shortages at its primary laboratory. Internal documents obtained by the BBC reveal extensive cuts to monitoring programs for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural runoff.
