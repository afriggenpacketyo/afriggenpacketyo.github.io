          <p>Paul Doyle, a former Royal Marine, appeared in Liverpool Magistrates' Court facing multiple charges, including wounding with intent and dangerous driving, after allegedly driving his car into a crowd following Liverpool FC's trophy parade. The incident on Water Street injured 79 people, including a baby in a pram. Doyle, who did not enter a plea, appeared emotional during the hearing, and reporting restrictions have been imposed. A fundraising campaign for those affected has raised over Â£30,000, with a significant donation from Jamie Carragher's charity foundation. Doyle's next court appearance is scheduled at Liverpool Crown Court. </p>

          <p>Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich responded to the county's inclusion on a list of sanctuary jurisdictions, accusing the Trump administration of criminalizing immigrants and creating fear. Elrich stated that the county cooperates with ICE on cases involving violent crimes and serious felonies, and will not change its policies based on political headlines. This statement comes after ICE announced the arrest of an MS-13 member who Montgomery County Detention Center had failed to detain on multiple occasions. Elrich acknowledged the error, stating that the individual met the criteria for ICE notification due to a prior felony conviction and gang membership. </p>

          <p>OpenAI, initially founded as a nonprofit research lab focused on safe AI development, now faces internal and external pressures as it navigates the tension between its original mission and the pursuit of profit. The company's success with ChatGPT has led to increased investor interest and a push to transition to a for-profit model, sparking concerns from former employees, AI experts, and regulators about abandoning its commitment to responsible AI development. Despite internal debates and proposed structural changes, OpenAI continues to expand its AI infrastructure and pursue industry dominance. The central issue revolves around defining and ensuring "safe" and "beneficial" AI in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, has been introduced in the Senate to require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles. This includes prenatal care, ultrasounds, delivery, postpartum care, and mental health treatment. The bill has gained support from both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups, reflecting a rare consensus on the need to alleviate the financial burden of childbirth. The legislation would be funded through modest increases in insurance premiums, averaging around $30 annually per person, and seeks to address concerns about declining birth rates and the high cost of having children in America.</p>

The separatist Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC) asserts systematic revenge attacks by government forces against innocent people, while the government maintains that Cabinda is pacified.

While Trump has taken steps to declassify documents and prioritize retribution against perceived political rivals, many supporters feel he hasn't gone far enough in exposing alleged corruption. Tensions arose when FBI officials dismissed conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein's death and Trump's attempted assassination.

Levels as high as 40 parts per trillion (ppt) were detected, exceeding some drinking water limits.

          <p>Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for Virginia governor, is attempting to distance herself from her past hardline anti-abortion record, although she previously supported a 15-week abortion ban and expressed a desire to make abortion illegal in most cases. Despite her past statements, she recently declined to state whether she would support any restrictions on abortion access if elected. This shift comes as polling shows her trailing the Democratic nominee and as some GOP strategists note her struggles to gain traction. Earle-Sears has also faced scrutiny for controversial comments on slavery and a note she wrote on a marriage equality bill expressing moral opposition.</p>

          <p>US retail giants are reportedly demanding that their Chinese suppliers bear 50% to 66% of the cost of US import duties, as the US-China trade war intensifies pressure on businesses. This shift follows previous agreements where retailers absorbed the full cost of tariffs. Sources indicate that major US retail groups, including Walmart, Target, Nike, Puma, and Adidas, are pushing suppliers in China and Southeast Asia to shoulder a significant portion of the levies. Negotiations are ongoing as both sides navigate a challenging period for the industry. </p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on dark energy, now questions the standard model of cosmology, which he helped establish. Riess's measurements of the universe's expansion rate differ from those extrapolated from the afterglow of the Big Bang, creating a "Hubble tension." While some cosmologists expect the discrepancy to disappear with more data, Riess believes it suggests the standard model may be flawed. If the standard model is overturned, it could change our understanding of the universe's end, potentially challenging the idea of a heat death. </p>

Joe Walsh, the first Alzheimer's patient to receive the treatment, has shown promising results with reduced inflammation. The treatment is part of a larger effort to find new ways to interrupt the cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's dementia. Researchers are seeking ways to tamp down the inflammation that accompanies brain changes, especially as the disease progresses, and a clinical trial is scheduled to begin later this year.</p>
