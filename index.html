            <h2>Supreme Court Halts Venezuelan Deportations from Texas Under 1798 Law</h2>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelans held in a Texas detention center under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law previously invoked during World War II. The ACLU argued the deportations were unlawful, as the administration accused the immigrants of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented. The ruling comes after lower courts declined to intervene, pending further review of the case.</p>

            <p>Economists are concerned that President Trump's escalating trade war and tariffs could lead to increased prices for American consumers, potentially hitting 4% inflation this year. Some experts suggest corporations might use tariffs as an excuse to raise prices beyond what's necessary, a phenomenon labeled "greedflation." A Yale Budget Lab analysis estimates that US consumers could face an average effective tariff rate of 28%, costing households around $4,900 annually, particularly affecting clothing, shoes, and electronics. The Federal Reserve Chair warned that tariffs are likely to generate a temporary rise in inflation, posing a challenge for the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal in Yemen, controlled by the Houthi movement, reportedly killed dozens and wounded many more, according to Houthi-run health officials.

The Houthi government condemned the attack as a war crime, asserting the terminal was a civilian facility. Thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to denounce the US strikes, while Iran condemned the attacks as barbaric.</p>

            <p>After Harvard University publicly rejected a series of demands from Trump administration officials, including discontinuing diversity efforts and limiting student protests, a GSA lawyer allegedly made a frantic call to Harvard's attorneys claiming the letter was sent by mistake. Despite this, White House policy strategist May Mailman stated the administration stands by the letter, while also criticizing Harvard for not contacting the White House before going public. Harvard responded that the letter's authenticity was unquestionable, given its official format and sender. The Trump administration has since frozen Harvard's public funding and ordered the IRS to revoke the school's tax-exempt status.</p>

The ACLU argues that these individuals are being denied due process and face potential life imprisonment in a foreign prison.

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation, before the Easter holiday. Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home and became a minister in prison, earning a reduced sentence. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation, reflecting his criticism of the Trump administration's immigration policies. Newsom also issued a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Medal of Honor recipient who struggled with PTSD and substance abuse after serving in the Vietnam War.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring US bond markets due to uncertainty caused by Trump's trade tariffs. A rare sharp rise in US government bond rates, coupled with falling bond prices, signals a potential loss of investor confidence in the US economy. Higher bond yields can lead to increased borrowing costs for households and businesses, potentially impacting economic growth. The bond market's reaction prompted Trump to introduce a 90-day pause on higher tariffs, except for those on China. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision impacts access to single-sex spaces and services, prompting debate and discussion about the implications for both women and transgender individuals.</p>

            <p>Artists and creatives are expressing concerns about the increasing trend of using AI to generate doll-like images, arguing that it devalues creativity and threatens their livelihoods. The #StarterPackNoAI movement has emerged as a response, with artists sharing their own creations to highlight the value of human-made art. Concerns include the risk of AI infringing on intellectual property rights and the potential for AI-generated images to saturate the market, diminishing demand for original artwork.

The winning robot, Tiangong Ultra, finished in 2 hours and 40 minutes, aided by long legs and an algorithm mimicking human running. While some robots struggled, the event showcases China's investment in robotics and AI, though some experts question the practical utility of such demonstrations.</p>
