          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge ruled that the accuser's testimony was not "credible or reliable," citing inconsistencies and an "uncertain memory" that did not align with other evidence presented during the trial. The central issue was whether the woman, who was 20 at the time, consented to the sexual acts. The high-profile case has drawn significant public attention in Canada, highlighting complex issues of consent and credibility in legal proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Claim 'The Simpsons' Predicted Recent Viral Kiss Cam Moment</h2>

          <p>A viral social media claim that the animated sitcom "The Simpsons" predicted a recent kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert has been determined to be false. The rumor, which spread rapidly online, used a digitally manipulated or AI-generated image to suggest the show had foreseen the event. This article from DW Fact Check confirms that no such scene exists in the episodes cited by the rumor. The piece also revisits other famous but often misrepresented "Simpsons predictions," noting that the show's creators attribute any accurate forecasts to the sheer volume of jokes written over decades, rather than intentional foresight.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that newly declassified documents, released by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, dismantle the narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump. The author argues that former President Obama and his intelligence officials, particularly CIA Director John Brennan, knowingly manufactured false intelligence to create this story. The piece claims the official Intelligence Community Assessment was deliberately altered to contradict earlier findings and was used to justify investigations into Trump. It concludes by stating these revelations prove a corrupt, politically motivated conspiracy against the former president.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has established a "strike force" to investigate allegations that the Obama administration manipulated intelligence regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The move follows the declassification of documents by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, who claims officials manufactured a narrative to suggest Russia aimed to help Donald Trump win. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the investigation will be thorough, while some Republican senators are calling for a special counsel. The allegations, which former President Obama's office calls "ridiculous," create a complex political and legal situation, particularly given a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.</p>

A U.S. special envoy stated that Hamas's position demonstrates a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire" and that the group does not appear to be acting in good faith. An Israeli official indicated that while there was no total collapse in negotiations, a return to talks would require finding a way to reduce the significant gaps between the two sides. The withdrawal comes amid worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, with international organizations warning of widespread malnutrition and starvation.</p>

The company reported revenue and earnings per share that surpassed Wall Street expectations and also raised its full-year outlook for these key metrics. While segment margin was a point of weakness, the article attributes this to increased R&D investments, which are seen as crucial for future growth ahead of the company's planned split into three separate entities.

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers is increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release more documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, beyond the grand jury transcripts the White House has requested. Legislation led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna seeks a comprehensive release, including flight logs, travel records, and internal DOJ communications. The push has created a rift, with some Republicans supporting transparency while leadership expresses concerns about protecting victims' identities. This congressional effort contrasts with the administration's more limited approach and recent DOJ statements that no "client list" was found in the files.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cyclical nature of facial hair trends, from its widespread acceptance in the 19th century to its decline and eventual counter-cultural revival. It traces the journey of beards and mustaches through American history, noting their association with presidents like Abraham Lincoln, their disappearance in the clean-shaven mid-20th century, and their comeback with hippies and later, hipsters. The piece reflects on the current ubiquity of facial hair, from politicians seeking a more relatable image to the trendy mustache-and-mullet combination.

The review praises Gordon's nimble and likable performance but notes that the film struggles at times to balance its tones, shifting between romantic comedy and light thriller.

State wildlife officials are monitoring the animal, which has exhibited unusual behavior by remaining in a small area instead of moving to lower elevations as is typical for this time of year. While the moose has not shown aggression, the trail remains closed for public safety.

Such a visit is highly unusual, as presidents have traditionally respected the central bank's political independence to avoid rattling financial markets.

          <p>Despite significant staffing cuts at U.S. National Parks due to budget reductions, many summer visitors are reporting normal, well-maintained experiences. This article suggests this is a "facade," as parks have prioritized hiring seasonal, public-facing staff while crucial background operations like infrastructure, wildlife studies, and administrative tasks suffer. Watchdog groups and former park officials warn that the effects of losing permanent, experienced staff are not yet visible to the public but will likely lead to a degraded visitor experience in the future. The National Park Service is described as being in a years-long crisis, with a significant maintenance backlog and a chilling climate for remaining employees.</p>

          <p>England has taken a commanding position in the fourth Test against India, thanks to a five-wicket haul from Ben Stokes and a blistering opening partnership. Stokes' performance, his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helped restrict India to a total of 358. England's openers, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, then responded with a rapid 166-run stand, significantly reducing the deficit. Despite the bravery of India's Rishabh Pant, who batted with a suspected broken foot, England ended the day at 225-2, firmly in control and looking to secure a series victory.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has dismissed criticism from the U.S. auto industry regarding a new trade deal with Japan, claiming that American auto CEOs are "cool with it." The deal sets a 15% tariff on cars imported from Japan, which is lower than the 25% tariff U.S. companies face on vehicles they build in Canada and Mexico. An industry group argued this gives Japanese automakers an unfair advantage, but Lutnick stated the CEOs he spoke with were not opposed. He suggested U.S. companies could avoid the tariffs by moving their manufacturing facilities back to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

In a 2-1 decision, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the law infringes on the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The court stated that California failed to prove the law was consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a standard set by the Supreme Court's 2022 Bruen decision. The law, which took effect in 2019 after being approved by voters, had required background checks for every ammunition purchase in the state.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, the professional wrestler and cultural icon known globally as Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71, according to police and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Hogan was a transformative figure in the 1980s, helping propel professional wrestling into a mainstream phenomenon with his larger-than-life "Hulkamania" persona. His career included six WWE championships, headlining the first WrestleMania, and a controversial but influential turn as a villain in the 1990s. Beyond the ring, he was a movie and television star, though his later years were marked by scandals, including a lawsuit against Gawker and a suspension for racist remarks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial predictions of soaring prices, President Trump's sweeping tariffs have not yet led to runaway inflation, though economists warn the effects are likely delayed, not averted. This analysis suggests that companies have so far absorbed costs and used existing inventory to avoid sharp price hikes, hoping for a change in trade policy. However, with many significant tariffs only recently taking effect or scheduled for August, the financial pressure to raise prices on consumer goods is expected to build. Economists predict that tariff-sensitive categories like electronics, apparel, and furniture will likely see noticeable price increases before the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has stated with a high level of confidence that the fatal crash of an Air India Boeing 787 last month was not caused by a mechanical issue. The investigation, which is focused on the jet's fuel control switches, has so far found no problems with the unit or evidence of its inadvertent manipulation. A preliminary report from Indian investigators found that the switches, which control fuel flow to the engines, were moved from "run" to "cutoff" almost simultaneously after takeoff.

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of placing $25,000 into either a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. Based on current rates, the CD offers a slightly higher guaranteed return, but the primary advantage is the fixed rate that protects against potential market downturns. The high-yield savings account provides lower, variable returns but offers crucial liquidity, allowing penalty-free access to funds at any time. The article advises that the decision should be based on an individual's need for an emergency fund, short-term financial commitments, and overall risk tolerance rather than just the marginal difference in earnings.
