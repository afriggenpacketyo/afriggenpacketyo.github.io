          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 81 fatalities, with dozens more people still missing. The majority of the deaths occurred in Kerr County, where a riverside Christian girls' camp was overwhelmed by a rapidly rising Guadalupe River. The disaster, which unfolded in the pre-dawn hours, prompted a massive search-and-rescue operation, which is now transitioning to a recovery effort. With more storms forecasted for the area, concerns remain for the safety of residents and the challenges facing rescue teams.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in eastern Germany have managed to bring several large wildfires under control following a weekend of intense effort. The states of Thuringia, Saxony, and Brandenburg were particularly affected, with one blaze described as the largest in Thuringia in over three decades. The fires broke out during the first major heatwave of the summer to hit the region, exhausting emergency services. Officials are now expressing cautious optimism as cooler weather has moved in, hoping to reduce the number of emergency personnel required for the ongoing containment operations.</p>

          <p>Maro Itoje will return to captain the British and Irish Lions for their upcoming match against the Brumbies in Canberra, in what appears to be a preview of the starting team for the first Test against Australia. Coach Andy Farrell has named a strong lineup, including the Irish center pairing of Garry Ringrose and Bundee Aki, and the half-back duo of Finn Russell and Jamison Gibson-Park. The selection provides a clear indication of Farrell's thinking ahead of the highly anticipated Test series. Several key players are being rested, giving others a final chance to stake their claim.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people essential time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The move has been widely praised by campaigners and charities as a significant step in formally recognizing the emotional impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for BRICS member states to take collective action in response to increasing tariff threats from the United States under President Trump. Speaking at the bloc's summit, Li emphasized the need for the nations to uphold their independence, build consensus, and work together to preserve global peace and stability. His remarks position the BRICS group as a counterweight to the Western-led world order and highlight the growing economic friction. The call for unity comes as a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and its trading partners is set to expire.</p>

The prolonged stay of the $110 million jet has sparked public curiosity and jokes in India.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a plan to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The threat was issued via social media as leaders from the bloc of developing nations met in Brazil. In a joint statement, BRICS leaders had criticized "unilateral protectionist measures" and "indiscriminate" tariffs, in a clear reference to the Trump administration's trade policies. The move signals a further escalation in global trade tensions and creates new uncertainty for nations navigating relationships with both the U.S. and the expanding BRICS alliance.

          <p>An Australian woman, Erin Patterson, has been convicted of murdering three relatives by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. A jury found her guilty of killing her parents-in-law and an aunt-in-law, and of attempting to murder an uncle-in-law who survived the 2023 lunch. The prosecution argued that Patterson intentionally laced individual beef Wellington pastries with the deadly fungi, while the defense claimed it was a tragic foraging accident.

          <p>A recent analysis argues that the European housing crisis, exacerbated by the financial sector, poses a significant threat to political stability across the continent. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have increasingly purchased residential properties, treating housing as a lucrative asset class. This has driven up prices and rents, making homeownership unattainable for many and fueling political discontent that benefits far-right movements. The article contends that this "corporate capture" of homes has shifted power from residents to investors, creating a system that prioritizes profit over social need. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States men's national soccer team lost 2-1 to Mexico in the Gold Cup final, a defeat that renews questions about the team's progress under coach Mauricio Pochettino. A victory would have provided a much-needed trophy and confidence boost ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will be held on home soil. Despite missing several key European-based players, the U.S. had a promising run in the tournament, allowing Pochettino to test fringe players. However, the loss in the final highlights ongoing inconsistencies and a lack of clarity as the team prepares for the global tournament.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the speed and severity of the deadly flash floods that struck the state. The Guadalupe River in Kerr County reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night, giving sleeping residents little to no time to react. Officials noted the absence of a comprehensive river warning system, citing prohibitive costs, and explained that residents can become desensitized to frequent weather alerts. This lack of advance warning is a key focus as the community grapples with the aftermath of the unprecedented disaster.</p>

          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy has shown the ability to reverse a form of congenital deafness, with participants in a clinical trial showing significant hearing improvement within weeks of a single injection. The therapy, developed by researchers at Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet, delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear. This gene is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain, and mutations in it cause a specific type of profound hearing loss. The successful trial, particularly in children, marks a major step forward in treating genetic deafness and offers hope for future therapies.</p>

          <p>Significant confusion has emerged regarding the implementation date for President Trump's latest round of tariffs, with officials giving conflicting timelines. While a 90-day pause on the tariffs is set to expire on July 9, administration officials suggested the new rates would not take effect until August 1. President Trump himself appeared uncertain, stating that letters and deals would be finalized by the earlier date. This lack of clarity has created extended uncertainty for importers and roiled Asian stock markets, underscoring the unpredictable nature of the administration's trade policy.

          <p>The UK government is facing calls from campaigners, charities, and parents to not abolish Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities. Critics warn that scrapping these legally binding documents could deny thousands of children access to vital support or even education itself. The government, which is reviewing the system, has not ruled out the change, with the Education Secretary describing it as a "complex and sensitive area." The debate highlights the tension between reforming a strained system and protecting the legal rights of vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>A major political and security crisis is unfolding in South Africa after a high-ranking police commissioner accused the country's police minister of interfering in probes into political assassinations. Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleged that senior officials, including the minister, obstructed investigations to protect politically connected individuals. The accusations have been described as a matter of "grave national security concern" by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The scandal has prompted calls from opposition parties for an independent inquiry into corruption within the South African Police Service.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. The Israel Defense Forces stated the operation was a response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. One of the targets was the commercial ship Galaxy Leader, which was hijacked by the Iran-backed group in 2023 and allegedly used for maritime surveillance. Following the Israeli strikes, the Houthis launched two missiles toward Israel, which were intercepted, escalating the regional conflict that has simmered since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
