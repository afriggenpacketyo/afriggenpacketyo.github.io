          <p>A Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam made an emergency landing in Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence, resulting in 25 individuals being hospitalized. Passengers described a terrifying experience with the plane shaking violently, causing people and items to be thrown around the cabin. The incident, which occurred over Wyoming, involved a sudden drop in altitude, and firsthand accounts mention significant injuries among crew and passengers, including broken bones. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the event, which experts suggest may be linked to increasing clear-air turbulence due to climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has finalized a new set of tariffs, signing an executive order that imposes duties ranging from 10% to 41% on dozens of countries. These "reciprocal" tariffs are scheduled to begin on August 7, with the highest rates applied to Syria, Laos, and Myanmar. The order also introduces a significant 40% tariff on all goods transshipped to evade duties, a move seen as targeting China's trade practices. While some Asian nations received lower rates than previously announced, the move has caused ripples in global markets and drawn analysis from trade experts who anticipate further uncertainty.

          <p>Following the signing of an executive order for new tariffs, President Trump engaged in a contentious exchange with a reporter, defending his trade policies. When questioned why he didn't implement these specific tariffs during his first term, Trump stated he was busy "fighting lunatics" and dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. He asserted that his administration had already collected billions from tariffs on China, which he claimed was underreported. The White House framed the new executive actions as a necessary measure to protect U.S. national security and economic interests by ensuring fair and reciprocal trade relationships.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old man from Oxnard, California, has been sentenced to 111 years to life in prison for the serial sexual assault of five women he met through dating apps and social media. The conviction covers nine felony counts, including forcible sex acts that occurred between 2012 and 2020. According to the Ventura County District Attorney's office, the man would meet his victims and later use his body weight to confine and assault them. The investigation began after one woman reported an assault in 2020, leading authorities to uncover additional victims through text messages on the perpetrator's phone.</p>

Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional gridlock, inevitably leading to more legal challenges requiring the court's intervention. He noted that the court has made procedural changes to handle these cases, including scheduling emergency oral arguments, and expressed a preference for more process. Kavanaugh also emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices, stating they are all patriots thoughtfully engaging with difficult issues, even when they disagree.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under the Biden administration, had her appointment as a distinguished chair at West Point rescinded. The decision by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll followed social media posts from pro-Trump activist Laura Loomer, who accused Easterly of being a holdover undermining the current administration. Easterly stated her opportunity was a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." This event marks another instance of an activist's public campaign influencing a high-level dismissal, following a similar situation with the head of U.S. Cyber Command earlier this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling extends their legal status and deportation protections while the case proceeds, with the next hearing scheduled for November. In a sharply worded order, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated the administration's decision appeared predetermined and motivated by racial animus, rather than an objective review of country conditions. The judge's order provides a reprieve for individuals who have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for years, some for over two decades.</p>

Researchers solved the long-standing puzzle of the potato's origin by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes. They found that a hybridization event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancient tomato species provided the crucial genetic combination necessary for tuber formation. This discovery demonstrates how interbreeding between different species can lead to the evolution of entirely new traits and the emergence of new species, providing a fascinating insight into plant evolution.</p>

The trade reportedly generates billions of dollars for Iran, propping up its regime and potentially funding its nuclear program despite extensive U.S. sanctions. Despite recent additional sanctions from the Treasury Department, the investigation observed numerous transfers, indicating the activity is only increasing.</p>

          <h2>Families of Crash Victims Call for Stricter Rules for Older Drivers in the UK</h2>

          <p>Following the death of a 79-year-old woman in a car crash in Cornwall, her daughter is calling for an overhaul of the rules for older drivers, labeling the current system "unsafe and inadequate." At present, UK drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70, but there is no mandatory testing. Department of Transport statistics show that older drivers are disproportionately represented in fatal accident statistics due to increased frailty. While advocacy groups support older drivers, some experts and families of victims argue for mandatory medical reporting and vision checks to improve road safety.</p>

          <p>Heathrow Airport has revealed a £49 billion plan for expansion and modernization, centered on the construction of a third runway and a new terminal. The airport's CEO stated the expansion is "urgent" as Heathrow is operating at full capacity, with the project to be funded by private finance. The plan, which includes diverting and widening a section of the M25 motorway, is backed by the government and business groups as a way to boost the UK economy and global connectivity. However, it faces strong opposition from environmental groups, local residents, and London's mayor over concerns about noise, air pollution, and climate impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, beating analyst expectations. Sales of the iPhone set a new June quarter record, and the services division also reached an all-time high. Despite the positive performance, the company provided little new information on its artificial intelligence strategy, which has tempered investor enthusiasm. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed that AI is a profound technology and that the company is significantly increasing its investment, but the stock remains an AI "show me" story for many on Wall Street.

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument to honor an individual African American at the state capitol, a site currently dominated by statues of White men, many with Confederate ties. The project, made possible by a bipartisan legislative push, is seen as a step toward telling a more complete story of the state's history. The 12-foot-tall sculpture is being created by artist Basil Watson to celebrate Smalls' journey and legacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun deporting non-African migrants to third-party countries in Africa, including Eswatini and South Sudan, raising alarm among human rights groups and UN experts. Critics argue the practice may violate international law, particularly the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids sending individuals to unsafe countries. The deals with host nations are largely secret, but are seen as a way for the U.S. to remove migrants whose home countries refuse to accept them. The policy is viewed as a harsh deterrent, but faces legal challenges and questions about the safety and due process for the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>In the first federal trial of its kind, plaintiffs are seeking $345 million in damages from Tesla over a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system. The lawsuit alleges that dangerous defects in the partially automated driving system and misleading marketing by the company contributed to the crash, which killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend. The driver, who believed the system would brake for obstacles, crashed while distracted. Tesla's attorneys argue the driver was at fault and that a ruling against the company would stifle life-saving technological development. The verdict is considered a crucial test for Tesla's liability in such incidents.</p>

The visit comes amid warnings from aid workers that a "politically manmade famine" is unfolding in the territory, with the head of a UN agency stating that more people will die without urgent change. President Trump has expressed frustration over the lack of aid reaching Palestinians, blaming Hamas for stealing supplies, though U.S. analysis has not found evidence of systemic theft. The visit reflects growing international pressure on Israel and the U.S. to address the desperate conditions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell after its second-quarter earnings report, despite beating revenue and profit expectations. While the results were strong, a modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, AWS, and a mixed forecast for the next quarter disappointed some investors. However, this article argues the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, as the core drivers of the company's value, AWS and advertising, both showed healthy growth. The analysis suggests the market is nitpicking, and that the long-term thesis for Amazon remains intact as it continues to lower costs and expand margins in its key high-growth businesses.
