          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, valued at approximately $400 million, as a gift from the royal family of Qatar. The jet would serve as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, at which point ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal experts within the White House and DOJ have determined the arrangement to be legally permissible, as the gift is not conditioned on any official act and is being given to the Air Force and then the library foundation, not to Trump directly. This unprecedented arrangement has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and constitutional violations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Istanbul for talks aimed at ending the war, following calls from Donald Trump for Ukraine to engage in direct negotiations. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a full and lasting ceasefire before any talks can commence, expressing a desire to halt the ongoing killings. Putin had previously invited Ukraine to participate in "serious negotiations" but did not directly address calls for a 30-day ceasefire. The offer comes amidst ongoing efforts by Western powers to broker a pause in fighting.</p>

          <p>Washington officials have expressed optimism following trade negotiations with China in Geneva, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent citing "substantial progress." The talks aim to de-escalate tensions between the two largest economies after Trump imposed tariffs on China, leading to retaliatory measures. The negotiations occur amidst complaints filed with the World Trade Organization against Trump's tariff approach. Earlier in the week, the US and UK announced a trade deal, though a final agreement is yet to be signed.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to meet with airline leaders to scale back flights at Newark Liberty International Airport due to ongoing technological disruptions and staffing shortages. Duffy warned that other U.S. airports could face similar issues as the summer travel season approaches, citing antiquated systems and increased stress on the network. The announcement follows a series of recent air traffic control outages at Newark, resulting in major delays and cancellations. Duffy is seeking to modernize the air traffic control system and extend the retirement age for air traffic controllers, though the plan requires Congressional approval.</p>

Lower oil prices may lead to spending cuts and reallocation of existing investments, potentially impacting both domestic reform agendas and international commitments.

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating their trade war following high-level talks in Geneva. The discussions, which occurred in secrecy, are the first since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January. While the specifics of the agreement remain undisclosed, Bessent indicated that details would be released on Monday and that Trump had been updated. The talks follow an escalating trade war that has seen both countries impose tariffs exceeding 100% on each other's goods.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded cautiously to Russia’s offer of direct talks, insisting that President Vladimir V. Putin must agree to an immediate ceasefire first. The Ukrainian leader’s comments came hours after Mr. Putin effectively rejected a cease-fire and instead proposed that direct talks between representatives of the two countries take place on May 15 in Istanbul. President Trump questioned whether either side wanted to make a deal but urged both sides to meet this week in Turkey for talks.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry’s plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has highlighted a rupture that could undermine the monarchy’s attempts to model unity. Harry’s emotional appeal, made in a recent interview, resurfaced bitter divisions within the royal family. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed. The article also touches on Prince Andrew's continued exile and Prince William's increasingly public role.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that a trade deal with China has been struck after two days of talks in Geneva. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported "substantial progress" in defusing the trade war, with details to be released on Monday. The deal aims to address the $1.2 trillion trade deficit, with the US maintaining a 10% baseline tariff. The announcement follows a limited bilateral trade deal with the UK, and the US is reportedly working on similar deals with other nations.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the United States had made “substantial progress” in talks with China after a weekend of meetings in Geneva, and that additional details would be announced on Monday. The discussions were led by Mr. Bessent and Mr. Greer for the United States and by He Lifeng, China’s vice premier for economic policy. Any indication of a trade truce between the world’s two largest economies would lift financial markets and ease concerns among companies, investors and economists that the global economy was poised for a sharp downturn.</p>

          <p>A fourth round of talks between the US and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program has taken place in Oman, with both sides agreeing to meet again. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said the discussions in Muscat were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as "difficult but useful." The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned chess until further notice, citing concerns that the game is a source of gambling. Officials said the game has been prohibited indefinitely until its compatibility with Islamic law can be determined. This is just the latest sport to be restricted by the Taliban, and women are essentially barred from participating in sport at all. Since seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban has steadily imposed laws and regulations that reflect its austere vision of Islamic law.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane being offered as a gift from Qatar’s royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption. The Trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be about $400m. Trump would then use the 13-year-old plane as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 January 2029.</p>

          <p>This article critiques a recent Saturday Night Live sketch about a server intensely flirting with middle-aged mothers, arguing that it reinforces negative stereotypes about women and motherhood. While the sketch seemed to aim at subverting the idea that middle-aged women, and mothers in particular, are both undesirable and empty of desire themselves, the sketch implied how ridiculous it was that a guy like him could truly be hot for these silly, frumpy old moms. The show had an opportunity to push back against the stereotype that middle-aged women, and mothers in particular, are both undesirable and empty of desire themselves.</p>
