          <p>A British Airways flight from Washington, D.C., to London made an emergency landing in Boston after a suspected bird strike caused smoke in the cabin. The Boeing 777 landed safely at Boston Logan International Airport, and engineers are inspecting the aircraft. No injuries were reported among the passengers and crew. The FAA is investigating the incident, which is part of a trend of increasing bird strikes in the U.S. due to growing wildlife populations and quieter aircraft.</p>

          <p>Democrats are facing internal divisions and struggling to unify their message in response to President Trump's policies. A recent rally featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders in California highlighted the frustration of some Democrats who feel the party isn't doing enough to protect their interests. While some advocate for strong opposition, others, like Governor Gavin Newsom, suggest moving the party towards the center to broaden its appeal.
