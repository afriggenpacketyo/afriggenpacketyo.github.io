        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized the trade relationship between the United States and India, labeling it a "totally one sided disaster." His comments followed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Trump claimed India imposes excessively high tariffs on U.S. goods, hindering American businesses, while also purchasing oil and arms from Russia. This rhetoric marks a souring of U.S.-India relations, which have been strained by U.S. tariffs and criticism of India's Russian oil imports.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has hinted that new, improved versions of its hypersonic missiles, the YJ-21 and DF-17, might be featured in the upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing. A military commentator on state broadcaster CCTV specifically discussed an air-launched variant of the YJ-21, which could be deployed from bombers outside enemy air defense zones. This development suggests China is building a versatile family of land-, sea-, and air-launched hypersonic weapons. While China has not officially confirmed the missile is in service, its potential display highlights the country's advancing military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors evaluated the outcomes of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, though sentiment was tempered by ongoing tariff uncertainty. The market movements followed a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both registered increases, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined. Economic data, such as South Korea's slowing consumer price index, also influenced regional trading activity. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation is using advanced facial recognition technology to potentially solve the nearly 50-year-old disappearance of revered Lebanese Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr, who vanished in Libya in 1978. Researchers at Bradford University analyzed a photo of a corpse, taken in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011, and found a "high probability" that it is Sadr. The cleric's disappearance has been a source of intense speculation and conspiracy theories for decades. This technological analysis, combined with witness accounts suggesting he was killed, could finally provide answers about his fate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eric Peters, the investment chief at Coinbase Asset Management, has suggested that Bitcoin has a significant chance of experiencing a massive rally similar to the 18th-century "South Sea bubble." Speaking on a podcast, Peters attributed this potential to Bitcoin's limited supply, which doesn't increase with price, unlike other assets. He stated that as institutional barriers to entry fall, increased passive flows into a fixed-supply asset could trigger a dramatic price surge. However, he also noted other possibilities, including wild price swings or even a decline over the next five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Telegraph is drawing parallels between contemporary Britain and the Soviet Union in the 1980s, suggesting a similar state of political and institutional stagnation. The author argues that Britain's managerial class, much like the late Soviet elite, is aware that significant change is necessary but actively ignores the reality for as long as possible. The commentary highlights a perceived rigidity and fear of questioning obsolete dogma across British institutions. This analogy serves as a warning about the potential consequences of systemic decline in Western nations.</p>

The decision is notable given Giuliani's recent legal troubles, including being disbarred and criminally charged for his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which stand in contrast to his earlier reputation as "America's Mayor."</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating, researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting age estimates. The fossil's features differ from both Neanderthals and modern humans, strengthening the theory that it belongs to Homo heidelbergensis or a related archaic population that coexisted with early Neanderthals. This finding provides a clearer context for the complex, branching history of human evolution in southeastern Europe.</p>

Heightened solar activity from a recent coronal mass ejection could push the celestial display further south than is typical. While visibility will depend on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, the phenomenon might be seen as far south as the Midlands. The best viewing opportunities are expected on Monday and Tuesday nights, offering a potentially rare and memorable sight for sky-gazers.</p>

Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering American health. In an op-ed, the former leaders, whose service spans both Republican and Democratic administrations, criticized Kennedy's recent actions, including the firing of top health officials and the promotion of unproven treatments. They argue his leadership is dismantling the nation's public health system and leaving the country vulnerable to future health emergencies.

          <p>Recent high-profile transfers, such as Alexander Isak's move to Liverpool, have ignited a debate about the increasing power of players in forcing moves away from their clubs. Isak and Brentford's Yoane Wissa both reportedly refused to train and issued public statements to secure their transfers, a tactic some pundits have called "despicable." In contrast, Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi, who remained professional, saw his desired move to Liverpool collapse. This raises questions about whether confrontational tactics are becoming a necessary precedent for players who want to control their career paths, challenging traditional club authority.</p>

The 25-year-old Swedish international signed a six-year contract, capping off a summer spending spree that took Liverpool's total outlay to over £415 million. The deal was finalized after the transfer window closed, following a protracted saga where Liverpool's initial £110 million offer was rejected.

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has warned that he would declare a "republic in arms" if his country were attacked by U.S. forces deployed in the Caribbean. Maduro claims the U.S. military presence, which Washington says is for counter-narcotics operations, is the "greatest threat" seen in the region in a century. The U.S. has designated a Venezuelan cartel as a terrorist organization and accused Maduro of leading it, but has made no public threat of an invasion. Maduro's government has responded by deploying its own troops and urging citizens to join a civilian militia.</p>
