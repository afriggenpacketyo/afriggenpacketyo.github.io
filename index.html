        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order, which aimed to punish the firm, sent a message that lawyers must adhere to the party line. Howell found the executive order violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, emphasizing the Constitution requires tolerance, not coercion, in response to dissenting viewpoints. The judge's decision underscores the importance of protecting lawyers' ability to represent clients without fear of government reprisal, ensuring the integrity of the legal system.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, two scientific groups, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society, announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on climate change impacts in the U.S. This collection aims to ensure that the scientists' work remains accessible, complementing rather than replacing the National Climate Assessment. The groups are inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work, emphasizing the importance of collaborative scientific efforts in addressing climate change. This initiative provides a critical pathway for researchers to contribute to solutions for climate change amid concerns that the official assessment may be less extensive.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a move described as a "radical departure" from past practices. This policy change would mandate studies comparing vaccine results against a placebo, raising ethical concerns among experts who deem it unnecessary when a vaccine is already considered safe and effective. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether this includes updated flu and COVID vaccines. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety, advocating for placebo-based trials to ensure vaccines do not cause more harm than good.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to regulate Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals in college athletics after meeting with former Alabama head coach Nick Saban. Saban expressed concerns that the influx of money has negatively impacted college sports and wants reforms to ensure a level playing field. Saban has previously urged Congress to establish national legislation to standardize NIL guidelines and protect the NCAA from litigation. The NCAA recently passed rules allowing colleges to pay athletes as a result of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlement, but further regulation may be on the horizon.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming the university deserves it, although it is unclear if the IRS is moving forward with such a change. Harvard has signaled it will resist the action, stating there is "no legal basis" for the revocation and that it would endanger the university's educational mission. Federal law prohibits the president from directing the IRS to conduct tax investigations, and such a move could face legal challenges. The university has taken a confrontational stance against the Trump administration's pressure campaign against elite universities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access sensitive records of the Social Security Administration. This request follows a federal judge's ruling in Maryland that imposed strict conditions on access to these records, citing privacy concerns. The administration argues that the judge exceeded her authority and is preventing the executive branch from modernizing government information systems and combating waste and fraud. The Supreme Court has ordered challengers to respond to the administration's application, setting the stage for a legal showdown over data privacy and executive power.</p>

          <p>Weekly measles cases in the U.S. have reached a new record, surpassing the peak of the 2019 outbreak, which was the worst since the 1990s, according to the CDC. The majority of cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, now the largest since measles was eliminated in 2000. While new cases appear to be declining in Texas, officials remain cautious, monitoring for potential increases due to Easter holiday travel. This year's case tally is likely an undercount, with experts suggesting many mild cases go undiagnosed, and the severity of the outbreak is higher than in Canada.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products from China to the United States, opting instead to fulfill all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This shift comes as the Trump administration closed a loophole allowing low-cost Chinese-made items to enter the U.S. without import fees. The company had previously started adding import charges for U.S. customers buying items from China after Trump announced his intention to close the de minimis exemption. Temu says pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model, and it is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order to end government funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), describing public media outlets as "left wing propaganda." However, the CPB asserts that Congress, not the president, controls its funding, setting the stage for a likely court battle. NPR and PBS vowed to challenge the order, arguing it infringes on First Amendment rights. Experts suggest the White House's political attacks may backfire, with CPB lawyers likely to argue viewpoint discrimination. Public media's importance to local communities, especially in rural areas, could give them an advantage in Congress.</p>
