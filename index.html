A suspect reportedly drove a vehicle at people and stabbed a man, injuring at least four individuals. Responding firearms officers shot the man believed to be the offender. The event has been designated as a potential marauding terrorist attack, prompting heightened security and condemnation from political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>The FIA, Formula 1's governing body, has declared the Singapore Grand Prix a 'heat hazard' for the first time due to predicted high temperatures and humidity. This new rule, introduced after several drivers experienced severe heat exhaustion in the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, allows for the use of cooling vests. While not mandatory, teams must fit the system to all cars to maintain weight parity. Drivers have had mixed reactions to the vests, citing both their cooling benefits and their relative discomfort.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear Chiles v. Salazar, a case questioning whether states can ban "conversion therapy" for minors or if such regulation infringes on a therapist's First Amendment free speech rights. The practice, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, is opposed by all major medical and mental health organizations as harmful and ineffective. The case, brought by a conservative Christian law firm, could have broad implications for how states regulate professional conduct and standards of care versus protecting speech.</p>

          <p>Two Delta Connection planes, operated by its subsidiary Endeavor Air, were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when the wing of a departing aircraft made contact with the fuselage of an arriving plane. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was transported to a hospital, but airport operations were not significantly impacted. Passengers were deplaned and provided with accommodations, and an investigation into the cause of the collision is underway.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has responded to a recent address by Donald Trump and his defense secretary nominee, Pete Hegseth, to top US military officers with mockery and criticism. Outlets like Shanghai Media Group's Kankan News characterized the meeting not as a strategic session but as a "public loyalty pledge" and a "MAGA loyalty test." The commentary highlighted Hegseth's focus on promoting a more masculine image and demanding resignations from unsupportive officers, portraying the event as political theater rather than a necessary military gathering.</p>

          <p>A group of three individuals calling themselves the "Kingdom of Kubala" has been evicted by police from a camp they established on council-owned land near Jedburgh, in the Scottish Borders. The group, which has a significant online following, claimed they were reclaiming ancestral land and did not recognize the authority of local courts. Following court orders banning them from the area, police and immigration officials cleared the encampment. Local officials expressed relief, citing the pressure the group's presence had placed on nearby businesses.</p>

          <p>The global airline industry is confronting a significant pilot shortage, driven by a post-pandemic surge in travel demand, a wave of early retirements, and backlogs in pilot training. Boeing estimates that 660,000 new commercial pilots will be needed worldwide by 2044 to meet this demand. To attract and retain pilots, airlines are increasing pay, offering bonuses, and improving schedules, but the high cost of training remains a barrier for many aspiring aviators.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the current government shutdown provides Democrats with significant bargaining power against President Trump and Congressional Republicans. The author contends that since Republicans passed their major legislative bill altering government priorities without Democratic support, they now require Democratic votes to fund that same government. Democrats are refusing to pass a funding bill without restoring healthcare cuts, placing the blame for potential soaring insurance premiums on the GOP. The author suggests Democrats should use this leverage and not concede to Republican demands.</p>

          <p>A historical analysis of over one hundred past societal crises suggests a recurring mechanism, termed the "wealth pump," drives instability. This process involves wealth being transferred from the general population to a small elite, leading to rising inequality, popular discontent, and an overproduction of elites competing for limited power positions. This dynamic has been observed in crises from ancient Rome to pre-revolutionary France. The article notes that while past resolutions often involved violent upheavals, modern examples like the New Deal show that crises can be navigated through redistributive policies and strengthening democratic institutions.</p>

          <h2>Officials Warn of Increased Rattlesnake Encounters Amid Climate-Driven Habitat Changes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increase in rattlesnake bites in areas like Tucson, Arizona, is highlighting the unexpected consequences of climate change on wildlife behavior. Experts suggest that rising temperatures and human land use are forcing venomous snakes to relocate into new areas, leading to more frequent and dangerous interactions with humans. A study from Emory University directly linked rising temperatures to an uptick in snake bites in Georgia. Officials advise the public to maintain a safe distance from wild animals and to call 911 immediately if bitten.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of university faculty are incorporating generative AI into their work for tasks like brainstorming course materials, creating grading rubrics, and conducting research. New research from AI company Anthropic shows that curriculum development is the most common use case, but professors are also using AI for administrative tasks and even grading. This trend has sparked debate, with some educators praising AI as a time-saving collaborator while others express concern that using it for grading or student communication could devalue the educational process and student-teacher relationships.</p>

          <p>Berlin authorities are planning to impose heavier fines on residents who leave unwanted items on the street, a practice known as "zu verschenken" (to gift). While the tradition is a beloved part of the city's informal circular economy, officials argue it has led to excessive dumping of trash and bulky waste, costing the city over €10 million in cleanup fees last year. Sustainability advocates worry the crackdown is short-sighted and could lead to more usable items being thrown in bins, while officials point to formal recycling centers and swap days as better alternatives.</p>

In Madagascar, demonstrations over water and electricity shortages led the president to dissolve his government. These movements are largely organized organically through social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok, with protesters sharing symbols and tactics seen in similar youth uprisings in Asia. Analysts note these protests represent a reckoning for governments that have failed to meet the needs of the continent's young population.</p>

          <p>Recent NFL rule changes, particularly the new "Dynamic Kickoff" formation, have significantly increased the importance and excitement of special teams play. Kickoff return yardage has more than quadrupled compared to 2023, as the new rules discourage touchbacks and encourage strategic kicks into a designated "landing zone." Additionally, the use of specialized "K" balls, which teams prepare in-house, has contributed to longer field goals, with kickers now threatening to make kicks from 70 yards or more. These changes have led to more action, higher scoring, and more chaotic, game-deciding moments.</p>

          <p>Mainland China recorded zero deaths from Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the world's biggest storms this year, a stark contrast to previous deadly typhoons. The successful outcome is attributed to extensive and timely preparations, particularly in the southern province of Guangdong. Authorities evacuated over one million people, deployed tens of thousands of rescue personnel, and opened nearly 900 temporary shelters in the city of Shenzhen alone. This proactive approach marks a significant improvement in China's disaster response capabilities compared to deadly storms and earthquakes in previous decades.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that Southern California Edison's lower-voltage distribution lines malfunctioned and started at least one fire in Altadena hours before the main Eaton fire, which has been linked to the utility's high-power transmission lines. On the day the fires started, amid hurricane-strength winds, data shows numerous electrical faults on distribution lines in the area, and fire department records show dozens of dispatches for downed or arcing wires. Despite the dangerous conditions, SoCal Edison did not shut off power to most of Altadena, raising questions about whether the utility could have done more to prevent the devastation.</p>

          <p>Stubborn inflation is changing how many Americans travel, as rising costs for essentials like groceries and housing leave less discretionary income for vacations. Since 2019, the overall cost of travel has increased by 20%, driven by higher prices for gas, lodging, and food. In response, many travelers are scaling back their plans by choosing domestic road trips over international flights, shortening their stays, and seeking more budget-friendly destinations. While luxury travel remains strong, lower and middle-income families are feeling the squeeze and making value-based decisions about their trips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waking up with a sore back, neck, or shoulders can often be attributed to improper sleep posture, which creates gaps between the body and the mattress, causing muscles to tense up overnight. Medical experts recommend sleeping in a position that maintains the natural curvature of the spine, similar to good standing posture. This involves aligning the ears, shoulders, and hips. Using pillows to support gaps, such as under the knees for back sleepers or between the knees for side sleepers, can significantly reduce strain and improve sleep quality.</p>

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency after its infant mortality rate reached its highest point in over a decade, with nearly 10 deaths per 1,000 live births. The crisis is driven by factors like preterm births and a lack of access to prenatal and maternal healthcare, particularly in rural "maternity care deserts." Health experts and advocates warn that the situation is a stark example of a national problem that could worsen significantly. They argue that cuts to Medicaid access will prevent low-income women from receiving care for chronic conditions before pregnancy, a key factor in preventing infant deaths.</p>

          <p>Amid the current government shutdown, attention is turning to air traffic controllers, whose actions helped end the last major shutdown in 2019. During that 35-day impasse, a slight increase in sick calls from controllers caused major flight disruptions, pressuring politicians to reach a deal. Now, controllers are again forced to work without pay, and while their union has urged professionalism, there are concerns that individual actions could once again slow down the aviation system. This highlights the critical role these essential workers play and the strain the shutdown places on national infrastructure.</p>
