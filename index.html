          <p>This New York Times article reports that months before the Pacific Palisades fire, Los Angeles water managers attempted to revive an old reservoir to supplement the area's limited water capacity. The Santa Ynez Reservoir was offline for repairs, and officials considered using the Pacific Palisades Reservoir as a temporary solution. However, the plan was never completed due to safety concerns, leaving the area with a reduced water supply when the fire broke out. The inability to bring either reservoir online undermined the water supply and potentially impacted firefighting efforts.</p>
