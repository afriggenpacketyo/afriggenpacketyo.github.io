          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted twice on Monday, propelling a volcanic ash column 11 miles into the sky and triggering significant flight disruptions. The eruption on Flores island, which has been on high alert, led to the cancellation of dozens of flights, primarily affecting routes between Bali and Australia, Singapore, and South Korea. While no casualties were immediately reported, authorities expanded the exclusion zone around the volcano and warned nearby villages of potential lava flows. The event underscores the region's high seismic activity, as Indonesia is situated on the Pacific "Ring of Fire."</p>

          <h2>Debate Arises Over Potential Link Between Federal Workforce Cuts and Texas Flood Response</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 17:35:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the deadly floods in Texas, questions have emerged regarding whether staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) under the Trump administration impacted the disaster response. While the NWS workforce has seen reductions, experts indicated that the forecasts and warnings for the Texas event were adequate, with local offices temporarily increasing staff as is standard procedure. However, some critics suggest that vacancies, such as for a warning coordination meteorologist, may have hindered communication between the NWS and local emergency services. The White House has firmly denied that staffing issues played any role in the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A man armed with an assault rifle was shot and killed by authorities after he opened fire on a U.S. border patrol facility in McAllen, Texas, injuring one police officer. The shooter, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, fired dozens of rounds at federal agents before they returned fire. Mosqueda had been reported missing by his father shortly before the attack, who noted his son had psychological issues and was armed. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation by the FBI, which found additional weapons and ammunition in the suspect's vehicle.</p>

          <p>Grigor Dimitrov's Wimbledon campaign ended in heartbreak as he was forced to retire due to a pectoral injury during his fourth-round match against world number one Jannik Sinner. Dimitrov was leading by two sets and playing exceptionally well when he collapsed in pain after serving an ace in the third set. Visibly devastated, he received a standing ovation as he left Centre Court, marking another unfortunate chapter in his injury-plagued career. Sinner advanced to the quarterfinals but acknowledged the unfortunate circumstances of his victory.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a second nationwide test of its emergency alert system, scheduled for September 7. Compatible smartphones will emit a siren sound and vibrate for ten seconds, displaying a test message intended to familiarize the public with the system. The alerts are designed for life-threatening situations like extreme weather or terror attacks. This follows a 2023 test that revealed technical glitches, which the government says have since been addressed, with the system having been used successfully in several regional emergencies since.</p>

          <p>California, leading a coalition of 18 states, has filed an amicus brief supporting a lawsuit against the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleges that masked federal agents have been conducting unconstitutional, "suspicionless" stops of residents, creating a culture of fear that disrupts community life and public safety. State officials argue these tactics violate constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and have had devastating impacts on both immigrant and citizen communities. The administration defends the operations as part of its mass deportation agenda and necessary for agent safety.</p>

While technology like Hawk-Eye is demonstrably more accurate than the human eye, incidents like this erode trust and highlight the tension between achieving perfection and maintaining a human element.

Research shows such interventions can significantly reduce peak temperatures in dense urban areas, which are experiencing more extreme heat days due to climate change.

          <p>Mortgage rates have decreased for five consecutive weeks, offering a slight reprieve for potential homebuyers, though the future trend remains uncertain. The average 30-year mortgage rate now stands at 6.75%, a decline influenced by easing economic policy concerns and the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its key interest rate steady. However, upcoming inflation data and future Fed announcements will be critical in determining whether this downward trend continues. Experts suggest that lenders may begin adjusting rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts, advising prepared buyers to monitor the market closely for opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Duration and Limits of Wage Garnishment for Debt Collection</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When creditors obtain a court judgment for unpaid debts, they can resort to wage garnishment, a process that typically continues until the debt is fully paid, including interest and fees. Federal law generally limits the amount garnished to 25% of disposable income, but the duration can last for years depending on the total amount owed. Rules differ for specific debts; for instance, federal student loans and IRS tax debts allow for administrative garnishment without a court order and may have different percentage limits. Consumers facing garnishment can challenge it in court, negotiate with creditors, or consider bankruptcy for relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A memo from the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there was no incriminating "client list" of high-profile individuals associated with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The investigation also reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein died by suicide, contradicting widespread conspiracy theories that he was murdered to prevent him from implicating powerful figures. This announcement has been met with skepticism and frustration by some who expected new revelations after President Trump promised to release files related to the case. The White House stated some files were withheld due to their graphic nature.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of migrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, effective in September. The program, which grants deportation protection and work permits, was first extended to these nations in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch. The administration stated that conditions in both countries have improved sufficiently for their nationals to return safely. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail legal protections for migrants and follows attempts to end TPS for several other countries.</p>

The existing app could cease to function in 2026, requiring American users to download the new one.

          <p>Tax experts are clarifying that President Trump's recently signed spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security for most beneficiaries, contrary to a recent Social Security Administration email. The new law introduces an additional $6,000 deduction for seniors, which may reduce the taxable income for some, particularly those in the middle-income bracket. However, it does not change the underlying formula for how benefits are taxed. Critics also note that by reducing tax revenue, the provision could weaken Social Security's long-term financial stability rather than preserve it. (not investment advice)</p>
