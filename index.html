        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's state broadcaster has claimed that the new J-35 stealth fighter jet possesses a radar cross-section smaller than a human palm, suggesting it could be stealthier than the US F-35. This low observability is attributed to the aircraft's unique shape and proprietary metamaterial technology. For comparison, the US F-35 is often cited as having a radar cross-section equivalent to the size of a golf ball. The announcement highlights the rapid advancements in China's military technology as it aims to compete with Western defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Food pantries across Maine are struggling with a critical shortage of volunteers, many of whom are retirees, while also bracing for significant cuts in federal food assistance programs. Organizations like Neighbor's Cupboard in Winterport are seeing diminishing food supplies and increasing demand, a situation exacerbated by the Trump administration's cuts to USDA programs. This reliance on an aging volunteer workforce and reduced federal support poses a significant threat to food security in a state where one in seven rural residents were food insecure last year.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has endorsed the Thatcherite economic policies of Argentine President Javier Milei, stating he is backing him "100%." The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to offer financial support, such as a dollar swap line, to stabilize Argentina's economy as it faces a potential crisis. Milei's "shock therapy" approach, which includes deep public spending cuts and privatization, has won praise from the IMF but has also led to rising unemployment and a recession. This support highlights a political alignment and a U.S. strategy to counter growing Chinese influence in Latin America.</p>

These moves, backed by the Rugby Football Union (RFU), transformed the team from a major force into a dominant one, marked by a record-breaking winning streak. Although the program is not yet profitable, the investment has increased player welfare, improved performance depth, and attracted significant sponsorship, showcasing the benefits of professionalizing women's sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have reimposed sweeping UN sanctions on Iran, ten years after they were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers activated the "snapback" mechanism, citing Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with international inspectors. This move follows Iran's suspension of inspections after US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear sites in June.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, could lead to the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people legally residing in the country. Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer distinguished between removing illegal migrants and targeting lawful residents, whom he described as integral parts of the community. He suggested that support for Reform UK stems from frustration with years of Conservative governance rather than from racist sentiment among its voters.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by TruStage found that 22% of middle-class Americans, with household incomes between $55,000 and $160,000, have not saved anything for retirement. The primary reasons cited are insufficient income to cover basic needs and the prioritization of more urgent expenses like medical bills and student loans. Financial experts suggest starting with small, automated contributions and taking full advantage of employer-sponsored 401(k) plans to begin building a nest egg, highlighting a growing financial strain that prevents long-term planning.

While many vendors continue to sell acitrón to meet customer demand for traditional dishes like chiles en nogada, some chefs and conservationists are promoting sustainable alternatives.

The revised plan ensures the system will be optional and managed entirely by public entities, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy infringements and data tracking. Recent polls suggest that voters, now more familiar with digital IDs after the pandemic, may approve the measure this time.</p>

          <p>The recent arrests of four major Scottish crime figures in Dubai, including Steven Lyons, represents a significant development in the long-running feud between the Lyons and Daniel crime families. This rivalry, which dates back to 2001, has been marked by murders, kidnappings, and a recent wave of violence across Scotland's central belt. The detained individuals are believed to be linked to international drug importation and directing violence from abroad. The arrests in the UAE, a location previously seen as a safe haven, signal a potential shift in international law enforcement cooperation.</p>

          <p>The internationally unrecognized republic of Transnistria serves as a key military and operational base for Russia within Moldova, complicating the nation's pro-European aspirations. Following a brief post-Soviet war in 1992, Russia has maintained about 1,500 troops in the region, effectively preventing its reintegration into Moldova. The territory operates as a Soviet-style dictatorship, controlled by an oligarchic group with ties to the Kremlin, and is a hub for Russian influence and destabilization efforts. This frozen conflict remains a major obstacle to Moldova's security and its path toward EU membership.</p>

The motive for the attack remains under investigation, but authorities have stated there is no further known credible threat to the public.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old New York man, Lorenz Kraus, has been arrested for murder after he admitted to killing his parents during a television interview. Kraus told an Albany news station that he suffocated his parents, Franz and Theresia, in August 2017, describing the act as a mercy killing due to their declining health. His confession came just one day after police discovered two bodies buried at the couple's home while investigating why they were still receiving social security payments.

          <p>This opinion article posits that Donald Trump's America and Vladimir Putin's Russia are conducting a parallel assault on European liberal democracy, reminiscent of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Both leaders are seen as sharing a disdain for the EU, international law, and multiculturalism, while promoting hard-right populist parties and using economic pressure and disinformation to achieve their goals. While not a formal alliance, their actions are mutually reinforcing, creating a pincer movement from the east and west that threatens Europe's security, prosperity, and progressive values.</p>

          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to combat noise and air pollution. If passed, gas-powered models would be completely banned, and electric devices would only be permitted from October to December without special permission. Supporters of the measure argue the devices are loud, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents, however, view the proposed ban as an example of an overly restrictive and unnecessary prohibition that complicates maintenance work.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she slept. Elliott called 911 immediately after the incident, claiming he thought he was dreaming and had no motive to harm his sister, whom he described as his best friend. His defense argues he was sleepwalking, a condition with a history in his family, and a sleep disorder expert testified that the act was likely involuntary. Prosecutors remain skeptical, pointing to the nature of the wounds and Elliott's demeanor during interrogation.</p>

The plan, modeled on the post-WWII new town developments, aims to create communities with at least 10,000 homes each, with a minimum of 40% designated as affordable housing. The government will confirm the final locations and funding details next spring.</p>
