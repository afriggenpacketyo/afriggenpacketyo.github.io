          <p>A private survey indicates that China's manufacturing activity contracted in May, marking the fastest decline since September 2022. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, signaling contraction for the first time since last year, primarily due to a sharp drop in new export orders, reflecting the impact of U.S. tariffs. The job market also weakened, with employment shrinking at the quickest rate since January, and factories accumulated finished goods inventory. This downturn underscores growing uncertainty in the external trade environment and adds to domestic economic challenges, as indicated by a weakening of major macroeconomic indicators.

Mia maintained her testimony, asserting that she had been "brainwashed" by Combs and now seeks to reveal the truth about her experiences.

          <p>The upcoming Tokyo metropolitan assembly election on June 22 is seen as a crucial test for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's long-term political prospects. The election's outcome could potentially force Ishiba to step down due to waning popularity attributed to concerns over his economic policies, including efforts to control rising rice prices. Historically, the Tokyo assembly race has served as a bellwether for national politics, influencing the dissolution of the House of Representatives and even prompting changes in prime ministers. Analysts suggest that Ishiba's political fortunes hinge on achieving positive results in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK government is threatening to sue Roman Abramovich to ensure that the Â£2.5 billion from the sale of Chelsea Football Club goes to Ukrainian humanitarian aid. The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, following Abramovich's sanctioning after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The delay stems from a disagreement over whether the funds should benefit all victims of the war, including those in Russia, or be exclusively used for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. The UK government insists the money should solely support Ukraine, leading to the potential legal action.</p>

The official, Andrew Yang Nien-dzu, cited the lack of direct communication channels between the two sides and the increase in "grey zone operations" by China's coastguard. These operations, while not military actions, carry a military message and place immense pressure on Taiwan.
