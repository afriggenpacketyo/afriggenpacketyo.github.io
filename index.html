          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a federal agent deployment to San Francisco, initially planned for Saturday, following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie. Prominent tech leaders like Jensen Huang and Marc Benioff also urged the President to reconsider, citing the city's substantial progress in public safety and economic revitalization. Mayor Lurie confirmed the decision, highlighting recently released crime statistics that showed significant declines, including violent crime at its lowest levels since the 1950s. Governor Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the reversal, underscoring the importance of local priorities in driving public safety initiatives and respecting community values.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the immediate termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, citing a "fraudulent" advertisement aired by the Ontario provincial government. The ad featured former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, which Trump claims was an attempt to interfere with a pending U.S. Supreme Court case that could affect his tariff policies. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation also stated the ad misrepresented Reagan's 1987 address and was used without permission. Trump emphasized the critical importance of tariffs for U.S. national security and the economy, making this the second time he has threatened to end trade talks with Canada.

          <p>The U.S. Senate failed to advance a Republican-backed bill aimed at ensuring essential federal workers would be paid during the ongoing government shutdown, which has now stretched into its 23rd day. This legislative impasse highlights the continued gridlock in Congress, as Democrats refuse to end the shutdown without an agreement to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits. The inability to pass such a measure prolongs financial uncertainty for many government employees and their families, who face potential loss of income. This article underscores the broader challenges in reaching a comprehensive resolution to the federal funding crisis, impacting vital public services nationwide.</p>

          <p>Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier were arrested Thursday in connection with two major federal gambling investigations that have implicated other NBA figures. Billups is among 31 defendants, including alleged Mafia members, accused of rigging high-stakes poker games using sophisticated cheating methods, defrauding victims of over $7.15 million since 2019. Rozier is implicated in a separate scheme involving exploiting leaked inside information about players, such as faking injuries, to make profitable wagers. The NBA has placed both on immediate leave, emphasizing the league's commitment to upholding the integrity of the game.</p>

          <p>"No Kings" rallies against President Trump have seen protesters don inflatable animal costumes, including frogs, lobsters, and unicorns, inspired by a Portland incident where an officer sprayed a frog-suited demonstrator. Participants like NASA engineer Scott Rohrbach use this absurdist humor to counter Republican narratives portraying them as "Hate America" radicals, believing humor disarms fascists. Political streamers Jordy Lybeck and Brooks Brown organized "Operation Inflation" to undermine claims of protests being "war zones" by making government force look farcical. Princeton professor Kim Lane Scheppele notes such tactics effectively publicize messages while laying a trap for officials, forcing them into responses that make them look worse.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown poses an imminent threat to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially cutting off food aid for nearly 42 million Americans by November 1. This includes vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, veterans, and people with disabilities, who rely on an average of $187 monthly. Advocates warn of mass hunger, reminiscent of the Great Depression, if funding lapses, noting that SNAP is often the only direct financial aid for low-income Americans. The article highlights the severe humanitarian impact and the legal debate over the USDA's obligation to fund SNAP, as states scramble to prepare for increased demand at food banks.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to strengthen significantly, becoming a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end of the weekend, posing a severe threat to the Caribbean. The National Hurricane Center warns that Melissa is expected to bring days of heavy rain to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica, potentially triggering life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides. With 8 to 14 inches of rain possible in affected areas, and locally higher amounts, the storm's slow movement over very warm waters is conducive to its intensification. Residents in the path are urged to prepare for significant impacts.</p>

The endorsement signals a mending of fences between the two, who previously exchanged harsh words during the campaign, with Adams stating, "when families are attacked, brothers come together." Adams, who dropped out of the race, vehemently criticized Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani's rent freeze promises, labeling him a "snake oil salesman" and "king of the gentrifiers." Cuomo, running as an independent, echoed Adams' concerns, portraying Mamdani as an existential threat to New York City and questioning his experience for the role.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states, including North Carolina, Missouri, Texas, California, and Utah, are engaged in a rare mid-decade redistricting push that could significantly impact next year's midterm elections. Initiated by President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to gain more congressional seats, this effort has led to reciprocal actions by Democrats, like California Governor Gavin Newsom's plan to redraw maps to favor his party. This article highlights ongoing legal challenges in multiple states regarding the legality and fairness of these new maps, with civil rights groups alleging racial bias. The intense partisan maneuvering underscores the struggle for congressional control and the volatility of the current political environment.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Louisiana has awarded over $40 million in damages to the family of Erie Moore Sr., who died in a privately-run jail in 2015 from head injuries sustained while in custody. The jury found LaSalle Management Co., which operated Richwood Correctional Center, and three guards liable for negligence, battery, and excessive force. This article highlights that Moore, a 57-year-old mill worker with no criminal history, was pepper-sprayed multiple times and suffered injuries after being forcefully brought down by guards. The verdict, believed to be among the highest for an in-custody death in the U.S., provides a measure of justice and accountability for his children.</p>

          <p>Summer Bushman, a mother from Virginia, is turning her grief into a warning for other parents after her 10-year-old daughter, Autumn, died by suicide. Autumn, who was bullied at school and on her smartphone, was reportedly looking at her phone screen just before her death. A Virginia Tech study links nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines to teen suicide attempts, noting that access to support is cut off at night. This article emphasizes the dangers of unmonitored screen time, especially for bullied children, recommending phones be kept out of bedrooms to improve sleep hygiene and mental health, and reduce access to medications.</p>

          <p>Reality TV star Kim Kardashian has publicly disclosed her diagnosis of a brain aneurysm, as shown in footage from the latest season of "The Kardashians," where she undergoes an imaging scan. The 45-year-old speculates her small aneurysm may be stress-related. Brain aneurysms are relatively common, affecting about one in 50 people, and often cause few symptoms when unruptured. This article explains that while most are asymptomatic, larger unruptured aneurysms can cause headaches or speech issues, and ruptured aneurysms are extremely dangerous and can prove fatal. Research indicates they are most common in adults aged 30-60, with women disproportionately affected.</p>

The case highlights significant regulatory gaps in the building trade, where builders are not required to be licensed, and a lack of a central register for convicted fraudsters.

Textile exports are down nearly 10% year-on-year, and the gems and jewelry industry expects a $9 billion hit, with many factories shutting down and businesses cutting production. Hopes remain for a potential trade deal to reduce tariffs to around 15-16%, which could provide a crucial lifeline to struggling exporters. (not investment advice)</p>
