          <p>In London, police arrested 890 individuals at a protest against the UK government's ban on the group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for supporting a proscribed organization, with dozens more for offenses including assaults on police officers. The protest turned violent, according to the Metropolitan Police, who deployed significant resources to manage the situation. Organizers, however, accused the police of using excessive force and argued the demonstration highlighted that the ban on the group was unenforceable and a waste of resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals a sharp partisan divide among Americans regarding President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to cities. Supporters, largely from his Republican base, believe the action reduces crime and enhances their personal safety, regardless of where they live. Conversely, a majority of Americans oppose the move, expressing concerns that it undermines their rights and freedoms without effectively curbing crime, viewing it as a politically motivated action. The survey indicates that opinions are more closely tied to political affiliation than to whether individuals reside in urban or rural areas.</p>

          <p>Oregon State's head coach, Trent Bray, publicly expressed his frustration with the team's special teams unit following a critical mistake during their game against Fresno State. The incident occurred when a mishandled punt snap was returned by Fresno State for a 42-yard touchdown, contributing to the Beavers' 36-27 loss. In a halftime interview, Bray used an expletive to describe the special teams' play as a "joke" and lamented self-inflicted errors. The loss dropped Oregon State to an 0-2 record for the season, amplifying the impact of the special teams' blunder.</p>

Barrett also discussed her vote in the Dobbs case, which overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, and reflected on her judicial approach.

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down, succumbing to mounting pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party. The decision follows a significant defeat for the ruling coalition in the July parliamentary elections, which undermined his government's stability. Ishiba had initially resisted calls to resign, citing the need to avoid a political vacuum while Japan faces significant economic and geopolitical challenges. His departure triggers a party leadership election to select a successor who will need to navigate a divided political landscape with a minority government.</p>

          <p>Former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick earned his first victory as the head coach of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he confirmed reports of animosity with his former team, stating he has banned Patriots scouts from UNC facilities. Belichick justified the move by saying, "It’s clear I’m not welcomed in their facility, so they aren’t welcomed in ours." This win provides a much-needed positive step for Belichick's new program after an embarrassing season-opening loss to TCU.</p>

          <p>London's transport network is experiencing significant disruption as Tube staff begin a five-day strike, the first to affect the entire network since March 2023. Members of the RMT union are taking rolling action over a pay dispute and working conditions, demanding a 32-hour work week. Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay rise but deemed the reduced hours unaffordable, leading to little or no service on most lines. The strike is causing severe travel disruption, with other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground becoming much busier than usual.</p>

          <p>Despite being a major exporter of green technology, China is increasing its coal power capacity, a move that appears contradictory to its climate goals. However, this article argues that the strategy is not a reversal on climate policy but a necessary measure to ensure grid stability. As China rapidly expands its solar and wind power generation, which can be intermittent, coal plants serve as a crucial "shock absorber" to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when renewable sources are unavailable. This approach allows for the aggressive integration of clean energy without compromising the reliability of the power supply.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association is facing criticism for its decision to instruct television partners to avoid showing any crowd disruptions or negative reactions to Donald Trump's appearance at the US Open men's final. This article argues that the move is a cowardly and hypocritical act of censorship that sacrifices the event's authenticity to shield a political figure from public disapproval. The author contends that crowd dissent is a form of democratic expression and that the USTA's policy is a capitulation that undermines the tournament's character, especially given its history of celebrating diversity and breaking barriers.</p>

          <p>The second-hand clothing app Vinted, now a billion-dollar company, originated from a simple problem faced by co-founder Milda Mitkutė: too many clothes in a small apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, created a website for her to sell unwanted items, which quickly gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early mistakes, such as initially forgetting a "buy" button and a disastrous attempt to add commission fees, the platform grew into Lithuania's first tech unicorn. The company's success highlights the growing market for sustainable fashion and online marketplaces.</p>

This stance is in sharp contrast to his 2017 actions, when his office raised concerns about a prayer room used by Muslim students in a Frisco high school. Critics argue that Paxton's selective promotion of Christianity violates the constitutional separation of church and state and reflects a Christian nationalist agenda that disregards other faiths.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's all-rounder Jacob Bethell has admitted that he "probably should have played a bit more" domestic cricket during a challenging first home summer in his international career. After a promising start in last winter's Test series, the 21-year-old found himself in a limited role, missing one Test for the Indian Premier League and serving as a spare batter for four others. Bethell acknowledged that he could have sought more playing opportunities with his county team, Warwickshire, to maintain his form, but also suggested the break might have been beneficial in the long run.</p>

          <p>A year after CEO Brian Niccol took charge of Starbucks and pledged constructive engagement, the company's unionized workers report that progress on a first contract has stalled. Despite the unionization of nearly 650 stores, employees claim that Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" strategy has increased their workload without addressing key issues like understaffing and pay. The union, Starbucks Workers United, criticizes the company for failing to bargain in good faith and warns of further labor actions to bring management back to the negotiating table to finalize a fair contract.</p>

          <p>Despite public commitments from President Trump and the Department of Justice to fully investigate Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, lawyers representing approximately 50 of his survivors say they have not been contacted by federal investigators. This lack of outreach casts serious doubt on the administration's pledge for transparency and a thorough inquiry into Epstein's network of co-conspirators. Attorneys for the survivors condemned the silence, contrasting it with the DOJ's lengthy interview with convicted trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell and calling it another failure to center victims in the pursuit of justice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are pausing their monthly payments using deferment or forbearance options offered by the Department of Education. While both provide temporary relief, they have key differences; interest may not accrue on certain subsidized loans during a deferment, making it a preferable first option for eligible borrowers. Forbearance is more accessible but typically results in interest capitalization, increasing the total debt. Consumer advocates stress that these are short-term solutions and borrowers should explore income-driven repayment plans for a more sustainable way to manage their debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of surveillance technology, from satellite imagery to tiny cameras and bioacoustic sensors, is raising ethical questions about animal privacy. This article explores whether animals have an interest in being unobserved and how constant human monitoring can cause them harm. Philosophers and scientists point to behaviors suggesting some animals seek solitude or alter their actions when watched, from tigers avoiding camera traps to birds abandoning monitored nests. The issue is particularly acute for animals in captivity, such as pets and zoo animals, whose lives are almost entirely controlled and observed by humans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign, combined with historically low U.S. birth rates, could result in the nation's first-ever recorded population decline. Demographers warn that if net immigration becomes negative by more than 500,000 people, the U.S. population will shrink, a milestone not expected for decades. This could have severe economic consequences, particularly for essential sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which are heavily dependent on immigrant labor. The potential for labor shortages and rising prices presents a significant paradox to the administration's anti-immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a widespread and often asymptomatic condition known as the "silent killer," increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg, starting with lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction. For higher readings, prompt medication is advised, as effective management can add years of healthy life. This proactive approach aims to mitigate the severe health consequences associated with untreated hypertension.</p>

With over 32,000 asylum seekers currently housed in hotels, the Labour government aims to accelerate its strategy by also considering other "non-military" options like prefabricated buildings. The move comes as the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, confronts the challenge of record numbers of people crossing the English Channel in small boats, underscoring the urgency of finding alternative housing solutions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term is characterized by a chaotic and aggressive assault on established U.S. economic norms, creating a period of radical uncertainty. His administration has taken unprecedented steps, such as demanding government stakes in tech companies like Intel, attempting to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, and imposing a complex tariff regime. This departure from the free-market principles of the "Washington consensus" is reshaping the American economic model in ways that are hard to categorize, simultaneously unleashing and reining in corporate power, leaving investors and businesses navigating a volatile landscape.
