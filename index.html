          <p>China has approved mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, named the AES100, marking a significant step in its aviation ambitions. This development occurs despite recent export restrictions imposed by the United States targeting jet engine technologies critical for China's passenger aircraft production. While the AES100 differs from jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts emphasize its importance for the country's overall aviation sector. Li Gaiqi, the chief designer, highlighted China's growing ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines, reflecting a major stride in technological self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning travel from 12 countries, citing national security concerns, after an attack on a Jewish protest in Colorado that authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally. The restrictions include full bans on entry from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions are imposed on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. This action is reminiscent of Trump's initial travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries during his first term, which faced legal challenges before a revised version was upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban is significantly impacting individuals in war-torn countries such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, diminishing their prospects of finding refuge in the United States. The restrictions imposed by the ban add another layer of hardship for those seeking asylum and safety from conflict and instability. The order has been met with criticism from human rights organizations and advocates for refugees, who argue that it undermines humanitarian principles and further isolates vulnerable populations.

          <p>Israeli forces recovered the bodies of Judi Lynn Weinstein and Gad Haggai, two Israeli-American hostages killed during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The couple's remains were found in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, following a special operation based on precise intelligence gained from interrogations of captured terrorists. Weinstein and Haggai were killed during the initial attack near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, with Weinstein managing to call emergency services before their abduction. The recovery brings a sense of closure to their family, who have been informed of their deaths, but also underscores the ongoing plight of the remaining hostages held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released globally, with stores opening at midnight to accommodate eager fans awaiting the console's debut. While many customers pre-ordered the device, some retailers experienced setbacks, including order cancellations and tariff concerns. Despite the initial excitement, questions remain regarding the Switch 2's potential to replicate the success of its predecessor, partly due to higher game prices. The console features upgraded capabilities and a new Mario Kart game, but some fans are hesitant due to the cost, while others anticipate years of enjoyment from the new device.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has imposed record suspensions on three lawmakers who performed a haka, a traditional Maori dance, during a debate on Indigenous rights. The incident occurred last November during the reading of a controversial bill that would have rewritten a treaty between the British crown and Maori leaders. Two parliamentarians were suspended for 21 days each, and another for seven days, marking the longest suspensions in New Zealand's parliamentary history. The lawmakers defended their actions as a protest against the bill and an effort to ensure Maori voices are heard in Parliament.</p>

          <p>Recent improvements at FEMA aimed at aiding vulnerable disaster victims are at risk due to program cuts and staff reductions under the Trump administration. The agency had made strides in simplifying application processes and providing immediate assistance, particularly for marginalized communities often overlooked in disaster relief efforts. However, these efforts have been curtailed as the administration eliminates equity programs and slashes FEMA's budget. Experts warn that these changes could lead to a regression in equitable disaster response, potentially harming those most in need of federal assistance.</p>

          <p>The trial for Bradley Rein, accused of driving his SUV into a Hingham Apple Store, resulting in one death and 22 injuries, has been delayed again, now set for May 2026. The delays are due to ongoing legal disputes over evidence requested by the defense, which claims a vehicle malfunction may have caused the crash. Rein's attorney argues that an expert found discrepancies between the SUV's electronic data recorder and Rein's statements, suggesting the car may not have responded properly to braking. Prosecutors object, stating Rein never claimed a vehicle malfunction and accepted responsibility, but the judge allowed time for Toyota to respond to the defense's request.</p>

While largely welcomed, some critics suggest other measures, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more cost-effective in reducing child poverty.

          <p>Divorce lawyers note a seasonal pattern in filings, with peaks occurring in late summer and early spring, while filings decrease during the holiday season and family vacation periods. This trend is attributed to couples often delaying separation until after significant family events to minimize disruption. A study analyzing divorce filings in Washington State found consistent peaks in March and August, suggesting a "domestic ritual" calendar influences these decisions. The average age of people getting divorced has increased in recent decades, with "gray divorces" among those over 50 on the rise, often driven by women initiating the proceedings due to increased financial independence.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has taken down several covert operations using its AI tools for malicious purposes, including those linked to China, Russia, Iran, Cambodia, North Korea, and the Philippines. One Chinese operation, "Sneer Review," used ChatGPT to generate social media comments and internal performance reviews. Another operation collected intelligence by posing as journalists and geopolitical analysts. Despite the variety of tactics and platforms used, OpenAI says these operations were largely disrupted in their early stages and didn't reach large audiences, indicating that better tools don't necessarily mean better outcomes.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House to address trade tensions, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and defense spending. This marks Merz's first visit to Washington since becoming chancellor in May, and it comes as Germany seeks to de-escalate trade disputes with the U.S. ahead of potential tariff increases. Trump has often criticized Germany on trade and defense, and Merz faces the challenge of demonstrating a collaborative relationship while advocating for Germany's interests.</p>

          <p>Proposed visa restrictions in the U.S. are causing international students to consider alternatives like the U.K., potentially leading to an influx of applicants at British universities. The number of students searching for U.S. universities has declined sharply, with concerns about access and diversity arising in the U.K. if more international students choose to study there. While U.K. universities may see short-term financial benefits, experts warn of long-term consequences for global research collaboration.

          <p>Minors in Maryland's adult jails endure harsh conditions, including prolonged isolation, lack of schooling, and fear of sexual assault, with the state frequently violating federal standards for youth protection.

Maryland law mandates that minors as young as 14 be charged as adults for certain crimes, leading to their incarceration in adult facilities. Despite the violations and potential loss of federal funds, legislation aimed at preventing minors from being held in adult jails has failed to advance in the state legislature.</p>

BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a prison sentence in Germany for an unrelated sexual assault case and is suspected of Madeleine's murder.

The incorrect data overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates, affecting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI).
