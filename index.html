          <p>Former President Barack Obama spoke about political violence in the U.S., referencing the assassination of Charlie Kirk and attacks on Minnesota lawmakers Melissa Hortman and John Hoffman. Obama emphasized the importance of disagreeing and engaging in contentious debates without resorting to violence, stating that political violence is "anathema to what it means to be a democratic country." He criticized leaders who responded to Kirk's death by blaming political enemies, urging for respectful public debate. Obama also mentioned his disagreement with some of Kirk's views, but mourned the tragedy of his death and the impact on his family. The former president joins other leaders in calling for an end to political violence. Optimism surrounding this event is moderate, as the former president reminds the country of the value of civil debate.</p>

          <p>The sudden closure of Poland’s border with Belarus is causing logistical problems for the China-Europe Railway Express, according to analysts and industry players. Milosz Witkowski of the Polish Forwarding Company stated that the reopening timeline is uncertain and dependent on Russia and Belarus. Lois Mo from New Silk Road Intermodal said that the border closure is impacting train operations and causing goods to be held in Belarus. If Poland prolongs the shutdown, it risks its position as a major transit hub between Europe and Asia. The border closure introduces uncertainty and challenges for trade routes, affecting the efficiency of cargo transport.</p>

          <p>Jake Wightman returned to the global stage, winning a silver medal in the world 1500m race after struggling with injuries in previous championships. Wightman collapsed with exhaustion after the race, narrowly missing the gold by two-hundredths of a second to Portugal's Isaac Nader. Josh Kerr, the defending champion, was unable to compete effectively due to an injury, ultimately hobbling over the finish line. Wightman's performance marks a significant comeback after facing setbacks. The event provided a mix of triumph and disappointment for the British athletes, highlighting the unpredictable nature of sports.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray seeking the death penalty. Robinson's parents identified him as the suspect from surveillance images, and he confessed to the crime, citing Kirk's "hate." Text messages revealed Robinson's planning and motives, including a note found by his roommate stating his intention to "take out Charlie Kirk." The death has sparked intense reactions, with some blaming the "radical left" and others criticizing Kirk's politics. The suspect's confession and the planned legal proceedings add a layer of complexity to this tragedy.</p>

          <p>Former Attorney General William Barr told a House panel that Jeffrey Epstein’s death in 2019 was "undoubtedly suicide," dismissing conspiracy theories. Barr stated that security camera footage and other evidence supported this conclusion, though he acknowledged a camera blind spot might raise suspicion. He also recounted informing then-President Trump about Epstein's death and Trump's reaction. The committee also released letters from former attorneys general who said they had no relevant information on the matter. The former US attorney Alex Acosta, who oversaw a contentious plea deal with Epstein in 2008, is scheduled to appear before the panel on Friday. The official stance remains that Epstein's death was self-inflicted.</p>

The FBI initially described the incident as an "act of terror" but later backed away from the label. Investigators are examining a message written on the car's window, and a bomb squad cleared the vehicle. Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint that did not have a federal nexus.

Amazon has released several AI tools for sellers, including a product listing generator and an image generator. The enhanced Seller Assistant uses Bedrock and aims to free merchants to focus on product innovation and customer relationships.

          <p>A report reveals that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) placed over 10,500 people in solitary confinement between April 2024 and May 2025, with use increasing under the Trump administration. The report, from Physicians for Human Rights, highlights a spike in solitary confinement in recent months, particularly for vulnerable individuals. Researchers found that solitary confinement placements for vulnerable people lasted more than twice as long as in 2022. The report includes analysis of facilities in New England, finding that solitary confinement was used for arbitrary and retaliatory purposes. The findings raise concerns about human rights violations in US immigration detention centers.</p>

          <p>A court in Shanghai, mainland China, partnered with a third-party institution to sell seized blockchain tokens on a licensed platform in Hong Kong. The court sold over 90,000 filecoins, a blockchain-based storage token, that were seized in criminal cases. Proceeds from the sale were transferred to a court-controlled bank account for allocation to the national treasury or victims. The event highlights discussions about mainland China emulating Hong Kong's approach to cryptocurrency to promote offshore adoption of the yuan. This also presents new challenges for the judiciary in handling crypto assets in cases involving Chinese citizens and companies.</p>

          <p>The American University of Beirut (AUB) has become a haven for over 1,000 cats, starting about 30 years ago when the university began taking in abandoned cats during the war in Lebanon. During last year's war with Israel, the campus gained several hundred more cats that were left at its gate. AUB spays, neuters, and vaccinates the cats and attempts to adopt them out. While not everyone is a fan, students are required to be respectful of the cats, which often meander into classrooms. The presence of the cats provides a source of comfort and stress relief for students in a challenging environment.</p>

She did not provide details on the poison or the labs, but challenged them to publish their results. Navalny, a prominent anti-corruption campaigner, died suddenly in jail.
