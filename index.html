          <h2>Dodgers Consider Utilizing Ohtani as Playoff Relief Pitcher</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 22:57:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dodgers are contemplating using Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher in the playoffs, despite plans for him to be a starting pitcher, according to team president Andrew Friedman. This decision hinges on unforeseen circumstances and the team's needs during a long postseason run, similar to how Walker Buehler was utilized in the past. Logistical challenges arise from Ohtani's two-way status, including warming up and the rule that the Dodgers would lose him as a designated hitter once he exits the mound as a reliever. Friedman expressed frustration with the two-way rule, suggesting changes for relief appearances, but emphasized the focus remains on navigating the regular season first, with Ohtani currently scheduled to start in Game 1 of a potential wild card series. The team will continue to assess the situation, leaving the bullpen possibility open depending on various factors, as the Dodgers weigh the complex pros and cons of how to use Ohtani's arm in October. The game's score may depend on this decision. Optimism is present given the team's strategic thinking and Ohtani's proven capabilities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached a "framework" deal for TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping expected to finalize the terms. This framework may lead to U.S.-controlled ownership of the platform, but TikTok has yet to respond to requests for comment. China's lead trade negotiator confirmed the deal and urged the U.S. to cease suppressing Chinese companies. This agreement comes amid ongoing trade discussions and a looming deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business, or face a potential shutdown in the country. The optimism in the market is relatively high given the two countries' willingness to reach an agreement.</p>

          <p>Simon Leviev, known from the Netflix documentary "The Tinder Swindler," has been arrested in Georgia following an Interpol request. Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Yehuda Hayut, gained notoriety for allegedly defrauding women he met on Tinder out of an estimated $10 million by posing as a wealthy diamond mogul's heir. He had previously been convicted of fraud in 2019 and sentenced to 15 months in prison but was released early. The arrest's specific reason remains unclear, but his lawyer stated he had been traveling freely around the world, while victims shared stories of romance fraud. The arrest itself is a sign of progress for the victims.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, allegedly confessed to the shooting in messages to friends on Discord hours before his arrest. Robinson's messages revealed details about the shooting, including references to a manifesto and a rifle. Discord's internal investigation found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord, but messages suggested he planned to surrender. Robinson was taken into custody on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction, and firearm charges, with the state seeking the death penalty, and his father had confronted him after seeing FBI images. The situation is tragic, with the tone of the article reflecting the seriousness of the crime.</p>

          <p>Two teenagers who urinated into a hotpot broth at a Haidilao restaurant in Shanghai have been ordered to pay 2.2 million yuan ($300,000) to two catering companies. The incident, which was recorded and posted online, led to widespread criticism and caused the restaurant to compensate thousands of diners who had visited the branch in the days following the event. A Shanghai court found the teenagers had infringed upon the companies' property rights and reputation, while their parents were deemed to have failed in their guardianship duties. The court ruled that any additional compensation offered by Haidilao to its customers was a voluntary business decision, and therefore should not be borned by the teenagers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has designated Colombia as failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly 30 years, despite issuing a waiver of sanctions due to vital U.S. national interests. This decision reflects concerns about a recent surge in cocaine production and strained relations between the White House and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Petro expressed regret, noting decades of bloodshed by Colombian forces in the U.S.-led drug war, and the designation is a major step against a staunch U.S. ally. Cocaine production has skyrocketed in Colombia since the suspension of aerial eradication and the 2016 peace accord, leading to increased drug seizures but slowed manual eradication efforts. The decision highlights the complex dynamics of international drug policy and its impact on bilateral relations.</p>

Diwali, traditionally celebrated after the year's last harvest, involves honoring the goddess Lakshmi and recognizing important relationships.

          <p>Tyler Robinson is in custody for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, with formal charges expected to be filed on Tuesday. Robinson, who is not a student at the university, had become more political in recent years, according to family members. Messages on Discord, reviewed by investigators, referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel and engravings on bullets, but Discord found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on the platform itself. Robinson's father recognized him as the subject of released photos and urged him to turn himself in, leading to his arrest. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities believing Robinson acted alone, and a public funeral for Kirk is scheduled for September 21.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that President Trump cannot fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before the central bank's policy committee votes on interest rates. The ruling allows Cook to participate in the pivotal two-day meeting, as Trump's attorneys failed to pause a lower-court ruling barring Cook's firing. Trump moved to fire Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, but Cook sued to block her firing and has denied committing mortgage fraud. The panel of judges sided against Trump's bid for a quick stay, but one judge dissented, stating that they would have granted the president's request. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump linked the beheading of a Dallas motel manager to immigration policies, blaming the Biden administration for allowing the Cuban national accused in the killing to remain in the U.S. despite prior arrests.

          <p>A report from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reveals that the Eaton fire left significant lead contamination in Altadena's soil, even after cleanup efforts. Soil testing found elevated lead levels in destroyed homes, yards, and homes still standing both inside and outside the burn area. Experts believe the lead comes from incinerated lead paint, and the contamination poses health risks, particularly for children. Homeowners are encouraged to test their soil and take precautions, such as removing shoes and wiping down pets after being outside, as the county is offering free lead testing for those most affected.</p>
