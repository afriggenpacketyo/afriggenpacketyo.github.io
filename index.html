          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his decision to step down, citing a desire for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to overcome internal divisions. The resignation follows mounting pressure after the ruling LDP failed to secure a majority in a recent lower house election. Ishiba stated that the timing of his announcement was influenced by the recent finalization of a trade agreement with the United States, which he saw as a key accomplishment before his departure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump drew sharp criticism from prominent Democrats for a social media post threatening to use the military for immigration enforcement in Chicago. The post featured an AI-generated image parodying the film "Apocalypse Now" and stated, "Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR," referencing his recent renaming of the Defense Department. Governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker, along with Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin, condemned the rhetoric as authoritarian and an inappropriate use of the armed forces against an American city.</p>

          <p>In response to a series of powerful earthquakes in Afghanistan that have resulted in over 2,200 fatalities, China has sent military transport planes carrying emergency humanitarian aid. The initial shipments consist mainly of tents and blankets to assist those displaced by the disaster, which has caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. Beijing's foreign aid agency confirmed that the Chinese government has allocated 50 million yuan (approximately US$7 million) for this emergency relief effort at the request of Kabul.</p>

          <p>The company Pray.com is using artificial intelligence to create cinematic video depictions of biblical stories, a project called "The AI Bible" that has gained significant traction on social media, particularly with younger, male audiences. While the company sees it as an innovative way to make scripture engaging, comparing it to the "Marvel Universe of faith," some theologians are critical. These critics argue that the action-movie aesthetic reduces the Bible to mere entertainment and strips the sacred texts of their profound spiritual power and transformative message.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers in the United Kingdom have an opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full moon to take on a deep reddish color, earning it the nickname "Blood Moon." The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, casting a shadow on the lunar surface, with the red hue caused by refracted light from Earth's atmosphere. Visibility in the UK will vary by location, with eastern regions getting the best and longest view shortly after moonrise.</p>
