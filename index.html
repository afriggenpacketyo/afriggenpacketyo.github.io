          <p>An op-ed argues that the U.S. government is ill-prepared to implement President Trump's new tariff regime due to a lack of resources, a clear process, and interagency coordination. The author suggests that Customs and Border Protection (CBP), already understaffed and underfunded, will face significant challenges in enforcing the tariffs, potentially leading to delays, confusion, and economic distortions. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;The piece highlights the absence of a formal rulemaking process and expresses concern over the reliance on presidential directives rather than a well-defined administrative legal framework.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration argues that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Justice Department claims that compelling a foreign sovereign to return a foreign terrorist within three days has no basis in American law. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national, was deported despite an immigration judge's 2019 ruling that shielded him from deportation. Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni conceded to Xinis that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed from the U.S. or sent to El Salvador.</p>
