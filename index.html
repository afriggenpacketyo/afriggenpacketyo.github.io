          <p>This article explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of pronatalist policies, which aim to increase birth rates, on children's well-being. While some policies, like providing financial support to parents, could directly benefit children by improving their financial stability, others, such as medals for large families, are unlikely to have a significant impact. The article considers the importance of societal support for families, including funding for schools and child care, and notes that pronatalism can sometimes reinforce patriarchal values that are not beneficial to girls. The article emphasizes that ensuring children have access to basic necessities like food, housing, healthcare, and education is crucial for their well-being. Optimism is tempered by the recognition of existing challenges in supporting families in the United States.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses a minerals deal signed between the United States and Ukraine, establishing a joint investment fund aimed at rebuilding Ukraine after the war with Russia. The agreement focuses on extracting Ukraine's untapped mineral resources but lacks a security guarantee that Kyiv had sought. While the deal aims to tie the Trump administration to Ukraine's future and potentially increase military aid, its practical implementation remains uncertain, with some Ukrainian officials expressing hesitation due to a lack of specifics. The article highlights mixed reactions in Ukraine, with some fearing exploitation of resources and others hoping for increased U.S. support and an end to the war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article examines how colleges are increasingly relying on consultants, often owned by private equity firms, to attract applicants and determine financial aid packages. These firms use sophisticated algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data on prospective students and their families, enabling colleges to offer targeted discounts and scholarships. The goal is to maximize revenue by attracting students who are willing to pay the most, even if they don't necessarily need the aid. This practice raises ethical questions about access to education and whether it perpetuates inequities. The article also highlights concerns about the increasing commercialization of college admissions and the potential for algorithmic collusion.</p>

          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz is expected to leave his post in the Trump administration after a controversy involving a Signal messaging app group. Waltz created the group, which was used to discuss U.S. military plans in March and inadvertently included The Atlantic Editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who reported details of the messages exchanged between high-level Trump administration officials. The group included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, CIA Director Scott Ratcliff, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Waltz's departure would be the first major official to leave the White House since the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term in January.</p>

          <p>Bree Smith, a former TV meteorologist, has become a vocal advocate against deepfakes after her image was doctored to create explicit content used in sextortion scams. She stopped appearing on television after months of battling the fabricated images and videos, which were used to solicit money from others. Smith is supporting legislation, such as the "Preventing Deepfake Images Act" in Tennessee, that would allow victims of sextortion to sue offenders. She emphasizes the importance of defining deepfakes as illegal and holding perpetrators accountable, and encourages people to report deepfakes to platforms and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This article examines the phenomenon of "spin purgatory," where companies planning spinoffs see their stocks underperform leading up to the deals. DuPont and Honeywell, two CNBC Investing Club stocks, are used as examples. Despite initial enthusiasm, DuPont's stock declined after announcing its split into three companies, while Honeywell's stock saw limited gains after revealing plans to spin off its advanced materials business. The article suggests that investors often stay on the sidelines or sell shares, believing the good news is already priced in. The CNBC Investing Club bought more DuPont shares during a dip, believing the spinoff will increase its market value.</p>

Kinshasa alleges that Kabila has been supporting the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, who have seized strategic cities in the eastern part of the country.

          <p>Coco Gauff delivered a dominant performance, defeating Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-1 to reach the final of the Madrid Open. Gauff, who had never beaten Swiatek on clay before, needed only 64 minutes to dispatch the world number two. She will face either Aryna Sabalenka or Elina Svitolina in the final. Gauff's aggressive play and strong serve proved too much for Swiatek, who had won nine consecutive matches in Madrid.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will not renew $1 billion in Biden-era grants aimed at boosting mental health services in schools. The Department of Education stated that the grant programs were not advancing administration priorities and were being used to implement race-based actions. Critics have condemned the decision, arguing that it undermines efforts to support students' mental health, while conservative activists have praised the move as ending a "slush fund" for left-wing agendas. The grants were allocated under President Biden's Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.</p>

The increases vary by country, with the Xbox Series S going up by £50 in the UK and the Series X increasing by $100-$130 in the US. While Microsoft has not explicitly stated tariffs were behind the increase, experts predict that US tariffs will increase prices for consumers and stir global economic uncertainty.

Drawing from the Global Flourishing Study, the author notes that young people's emotional and psychological distress is a global phenomenon. The study reveals that the traditional U-shaped happiness curve, where happiness declines in early and middle adulthood before rising later in life, is less pronounced among today's young people. However, the study also finds that young people with more friends and intimate social relationships experience a more traditional U-shaped curve, highlighting the importance of human connection.</p>
