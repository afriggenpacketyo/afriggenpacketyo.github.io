        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing an intense heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber heat-health alert for England, which will remain in force until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Firefighters are also deeply concerned about the escalating threat of wildfires, with a 717% surge compared to the same period in 2024, urging the public to be careful with barbecues and flammable objects. The heatwave is expected to continue, but some relief is anticipated on Sunday, with cooler air gradually sweeping in from the west. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are launching "trial living" schemes to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The initiative offers free stays for up to four weeks, aiming to encourage long-term relocation by highlighting affordable accommodation, reduced traffic, and a strong sense of community. Guben, one of the participating cities, has seen some success, with a portion of participants choosing to move there permanently, leading to similar projects in nearby towns. The effort is a response to significant demographic changes since German reunification, including declining birth rates, emigration of young people, and an aging population, as the city seeks to fill job vacancies and revitalize its economy. The project aims to create a welcoming culture and social interaction to encourage more people to settle in the city long-term. </p>

          <p>Protests erupted in southeast Los Angeles County following an immigration raid at a car wash in Bell, where federal agents detained at least three people, leading to confrontations with masked men in fatigues. Security camera footage shows agents chasing and detaining car wash employees, including a U.S. citizen who intervened to defend a coworker. Protesters confronted the agents, with some damaging federal vehicles, prompting the Department of Homeland Security to issue a statement condemning the violence and stating that one driver was arrested for vehicular assault. Local officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have questioned the tactics of the federal agents, who are accused of not identifying themselves, while the protest underscores ongoing tensions over immigration enforcement in the region. The protest illustrates the community's strong support for immigrants and their opposition to federal immigration policies. </p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions faced challenges with cohesion in their first match of the 2025 tour, resulting in a defeat against Argentina. Despite ambition and opportunities created through sharp passages of play, the Lions struggled with execution, including offloads that went to ground and passes that were off the mark. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration, emphasizing that the team compounded too many errors and were unable to establish the desired pace. The team's attack showed promise, but Farrell is expected to demand sharper performance as they continue their tour in Australia. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged downturn, exacerbated by a shrinking population, which is further suppressing demand for new homes. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed at under 5 million units per year in the coming years â€” one fourth of the peak of 20 million units in 2017. The country's population is expected to decline to below 1.39 billion by 2035, contributing to a reduction in home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million units in the 2030s. Despite Beijing's efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes, job instability, and a poor social security system continue to discourage young people from having more children.

A joint venture was launched between companies from Japan, Britain, and Italy to develop a next-generation fighter jet by 2035. A Japanese-Peruvian fusion restaurant in Lima was named the world's best, recognizing the blending of Japanese techniques with Peruvian ingredients. Japanese restaurants and food companies are switching to noodles from rice due to rising rice prices, and regions are benefiting from Japan's anime and manga soft power reach, boosting local economies. The U.S. reportedly asked Japan to raise defense spending to 3.5% of GDP. </p>

This comes shortly before the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, amid heightened security and political sensitivity regarding religious matters in China.

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's long-held ambition to confront Iran has materialized with Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear plants, a move supported by a majority of Israelis who view Iran as a significant threat. Despite facing domestic challenges and criticism over his handling of the conflict with Hamas, Netanyahu's decision to strike Iran has garnered broad support, offering him a chance to reshape his legacy. However, the ongoing exchanges of bombs, drones, and missiles have caused civilian casualties and significant damage, raising concerns about the potential for a devastating "war of cities" between Tehran and Tel Aviv. While the attack has provided a temporary respite from his political troubles, it remains to be seen whether it will ultimately lead to a more secure future for Israel or further entrench the country in a protracted and destructive conflict. </p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, who spent months in custody as the Trump administration attempted to deport him due to "foreign policy" concerns, addressed reporters after leaving the facility, stating that the administration chose the wrong person to target. A judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community, not a flight risk and that his detention has been "highly unusual." Khalil, a green card holder, was detained by immigration agents in March, and his wife gave birth to their first child while he was in custody. </p>

The dismissal followed severe sanctions imposed on the prosecution for failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence ahead of trial. Morphew's attorney stated that her client was innocent and that there was no physical evidence connecting him to the alleged crime. The case has been marked by numerous twists and turns, including a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a secret lover. </p>

The Department of Homeland Security had previously revoked Harvard's student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism.

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has approved legislation to ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons, sending the bill to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports such a ban. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 other states with similar prohibitions, though this bill only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and will only punish law-abiding citizens, while some gun control advocates have described the proposed law as the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country". The Supreme Court may soon take up the issue, with some justices indicating skepticism about the constitutionality of such bans. </p>
