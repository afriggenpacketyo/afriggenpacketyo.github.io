          <p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot described the situation in Gaza as appalling and on the brink of catastrophe, calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian aid. He defended France's decision to recognize a Palestinian state as a necessary step to restart a two-state solution political process, viewing it as complementary to U.S. efforts like the Abraham Accords. Barrot also addressed the Iran nuclear issue, stating that France, Germany, and the UK will reapply global embargoes by the end of summer if a new, robust agreement is not reached. The interview also touched upon an investigation into the removal of French-Jewish students from a flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are advocating for a comprehensive release of documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, going beyond just a reported "birthday book." Massie emphasized the need to examine financial records and the original plea bargain to "follow the money." Their joint legislation aims to force a House vote on releasing the files, bypassing the Speaker, with protections to redact victim names. Khanna noted that their push for transparency is not new and is focused on exposing powerful individuals who may have acted with impunity, rather than solely targeting former President Trump.</p>

          <h2>Stephen Colbert's Show Ending Sparks Debate on the Future of Late-Night Television</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" has prompted discussions about the viability of the late-night television format amid a shifting media landscape. While some view it as a one-off financial decision by Paramount, others see it as a sign of decline for traditional TV, pressured by streaming and shrinking ad revenue. The article notes that shows like Colbert's and "Jimmy Kimmel Live" operate at a significant financial loss, raising questions about their sustainability. Disney's upcoming decision on Jimmy Kimmel's contract is seen as the next major indicator for the industry's commitment to the genre.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" had a successful debut, earning $118 million domestically and $218 million globally, marking a return to form for the studio. This performance exceeded expectations and is seen as a significant relief for Disney and Marvel, which have faced recent box office struggles with other superhero films. The movie, the first "Fantastic Four" film under Disney's ownership, received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The success follows that of "Deadpool & Wolverine," suggesting Disney is effectively leveraging intellectual properties acquired from 21st Century Fox.</p>

          <p>The White House has reportedly ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to cease using polygraph tests on Pentagon staff in an effort to identify individuals responsible for unauthorized leaks. The intervention allegedly occurred after a senior adviser to Hegseth, Patrick Weaver, informed administration officials he might be subjected to a test. The internal investigation was initiated in March following the disclosure of sensitive communications. This development is the latest controversy for the Pentagon, which recently dealt with the "Signalgate" scandal involving leaked discussions about military action on an encrypted app.</p>

          <p>A cybercrime trend known as "quishing" is on the rise, where criminals use fake QR codes to deceive people into visiting malicious websites or revealing personal information. These scams exploit the ubiquity of QR codes in daily life, such as on parking meters or bills, relying on the user's sense of urgency. Cybersecurity experts note that these attacks are increasing as traditional email phishing becomes less effective, with one study finding 26% of malicious links are now sent via QR codes. The Federal Trade Commission and state agencies have issued warnings, advising the public to be cautious and avoid scanning unexpected or untrusted QR codes.</p>

The senators are questioning a $30 million U.S. pledge to the GHF, which Israel and the U.S. have promoted as a replacement for U.N. aid agencies.

However, what constitutes a sufficient deal remains unclear, with the president himself stating there is a "50-50 chance" of reaching an agreement due to numerous sticking points.

          <p>An analysis by the BBC's international editor suggests Israel's recent announcement of aid airdrops and "tactical pauses" in Gaza is likely a gesture toward allies who have condemned the starvation crisis, rather than a fundamental policy shift. Israel's claims that it does not restrict aid are not accepted by European allies or the U.N. The article notes the controversy surrounding the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which aid agencies refuse to work with, calling it inhumane and militarized. Experts state that for the new measures to be effective, Israel must genuinely expedite aid transit and ensure civilians are not shot while collecting supplies.</p>

The boy was found unresponsive and pronounced dead at the scene. The DHR contractor has terminated the employee involved, and police are investigating the incident for potential criminal charges. The death has prompted calls from state lawmakers to examine existing laws to prevent similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Space Command is actively preparing for the possibility of satellite-on-satellite combat, a new frontier in military engagement. General Stephen Whiting highlighted a recent joint exercise with France involving a "rendezvous and proximity operation" (RPO), where allied satellites maneuvered near an adversary's satellite. This demonstration was a signal of combined operational capability in response to provocative maneuvers by nations like Russia. These exercises underscore a strategic shift towards treating space as a potential warfighting domain, where satellites can be inspected, manipulated, or potentially disabled by hostile actors, requiring new defensive and offensive strategies.</p>

          <p>A financial advice columnist analyzes the newly established "Trump IRA," a savings account for children under 18 that includes a one-time $1,000 government contribution for those born between 2025 and 2028. While acknowledging the free money is a benefit, the author argues it's more of a political giveaway than an effective long-term savings tool. The article suggests that parents have better options for their children's future, such as 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs, which offer greater growth potential and flexibility. It also advocates for purchasing whole life insurance policies for children to lock in low premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian drones targeted St. Petersburg on Sunday, causing a five-hour closure of the city's main airport, as President Vladimir Putin was in the city to mark Russia's Navy Day. The traditional large-scale naval parade on the Neva River was cancelled this year due to security concerns, a move confirmed by the Kremlin. Instead, Putin observed drills from the naval headquarters. Russia's Defence Ministry reported downing 291 Ukrainian drones across the country on Sunday. The attack on St. Petersburg, which injured one woman from falling debris, highlights Ukraine's expanding capability to strike deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness comes not just from having more free time, but also from feeling more effective at work. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, when faced with less time, workers and teams become more efficient by eliminating busywork and focusing on important tasks. This increased sense of productivity and feeling on top of their work contributes significantly to overall well-being. The shift also signals a new level of trust from employers and can strengthen team spirit as colleagues collaborate to work smarter.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced that her party would ban all National Health Service (NHS) doctors from taking industrial action if it returns to power. The proposal would place doctors under the same strike restrictions as police and military personnel by legislating for minimum service levels. The announcement comes as resident doctors began a five-day strike over pay, with the British Medical Association (BMA) arguing that wages have fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008. Badenoch accused the union of being "militant" and framed the proposed ban as a measure to protect patients.</p>

This shift is forcing French companies, which once enjoyed preferential treatment, to adapt to a new reality where competitors like China are gaining significant market share. In response, some French multinationals are pivoting to English- and Portuguese-speaking African nations or adopting new strategies, such as forming joint ventures and local partnerships to maintain a more indirect presence.
