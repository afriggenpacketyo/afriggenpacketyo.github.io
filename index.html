          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 12:11:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing decreased interest from potential buyers worried about the economy, U.S. homebuilders are cutting prices at the highest rate since 2022. According to a National Association of Home Builders survey, 38% of builders reported reducing prices in July, with an average reduction of 5%. Despite a slight rise in overall builder confidence, negative sentiment has persisted for 15 consecutive months, driven by high mortgage rates and affordability challenges. This trend suggests the housing market continues to struggle, with single-family housing starts projected to decline in 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency stablecoins. The bill's progress was temporarily halted by a rebellion from right-wing Republicans who sought to package it with other measures, including a ban on a central bank digital currency. After negotiations involving former President Trump, a deal was reached to advance the crypto bill separately, making it the first major digital asset legislation to be passed by a chamber of Congress. The bill aims to establish a much-needed regulatory framework for the burgeoning digital currency market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chair of the Los Angeles County Republican Party, Roxanne Hoge, commented on the political dynamics surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions in the city. Hoge argued that while Democrats control the city's government, the federal crackdown addresses issues like crime and illegal business operations, which could inadvertently make Democratic leaders look better. She asserted that the core message for the GOP should be public safety, a point she believes resonates with voters who are dissatisfied with the local government's handling of encampments and the business climate. The article frames the situation as a complex interplay of federal and local politics.</p>

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia is calling on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to justify the Trump administration's significant funding cuts to HIV/AIDS programs. In a formal letter, Garcia expressed concern that the cuts are motivated by Kennedy's history of spreading misinformation, including questioning the link between HIV and AIDS. The letter details several major reductions, such as the elimination of the CDC's HIV prevention division and the termination of NIH research grants. Garcia argues these actions threaten decades of progress and will endanger lives both in the U.S. and globally.</p>

          <p>Charisma, often seen as an innate gift, can be understood as a combination of influence and affability, according to psychological research. This article delves into the components of this magnetic quality, noting that charismatic individuals effectively guide others while making them feel at ease. While traits like extroversion and attractiveness are correlated with charisma, evidence suggests it can be learned through specific verbal and nonverbal communication techniques. However, the article also cautions that extreme charisma can be counterproductive for leaders and is linked with self-consciousness, which may not lead to greater personal happiness.</p>

Trade data from 2024 shows these assertions are inaccurate, as the EU was the fourth-largest market for U.S. agricultural goods, buying a record $12.8 billion worth. Similarly, while the U.S. imports more European vehicles, the EU still purchased about 165,000 American-made vehicles in the same year.

          <p>Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, 'Too Much,' presents a starkly pragmatic and unromantic view of modern relationships, a departure from classic rom-coms. The show follows Jess (Megan Stalter), an American who moves to London and enters a relationship with Felix (Will Sharpe) that is built more on mutual need and inertia than passion. This article analyzes the series as a reflection of love in precarious economic times, where stability and practicality may outweigh traditional romance. The review notes the show's sitcom-like, low-fi British style and its exploration of how past relational trauma shapes the characters' present connection.</p>

          <p>A recent uptick in inflation is expected to influence the Federal Reserve to maintain its current high interest rates, which in turn will likely keep rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) elevated. Since HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, homeowners with these loans are unlikely to see relief soon. If inflation continues to rise, the Fed could even implement further hikes, increasing borrowing costs. Despite this, HELOCs remain a more affordable borrowing option compared to credit cards or personal loans, but homeowners should carefully consider the risk of fluctuating payments.

          <p>Elon Musk has been given more time to formally respond to a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding his 2022 stock purchases of Twitter, now known as X. The SEC agreed to push the deadline to August 29. The agency's lawsuit, filed in January, alleges that Musk violated securities law by failing to promptly disclose his growing stake in the company. This delay allegedly allowed him to purchase additional shares at a lower price, saving him at least $150 million. Musk's legal team has previously denied any wrongdoing, calling the lawsuit a "sham."</p>

          <p>Following a record-breaking heat dome in June, a group of Democratic lawmakers is proposing legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local governments to request federal funding from FEMA for heat-related emergencies, similar to hurricanes or floods. Proponents argue that heat causes more deaths than any other weather event, yet it is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster. The funding could be used for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects, though the bill faces political opposition.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI-generated music, exemplified by the viral success of synthetic bands like The Velvet Sundown, is causing significant anxiety across the music industry. While AI tools have long been used in production, new platforms allow for the easy creation of entire songs, which are now flooding streaming services like Spotify. This has led to lawsuits from major record labels over copyright infringement and concerns from human artists about competing with AI-generated content.

An earlier proposal to cut funding for the PEPFAR HIV/AIDS program was removed to secure enough votes for passage.

          <p>A comprehensive study has found that migrants living in Germany earn nearly 20% less than their native-born counterparts. Researchers concluded this wage gap is not due to unequal pay for the same job, but rather to structural barriers that prevent migrants from accessing higher-paying industries and roles. The gap persists into the second generation, which still earns 7.7% less on average, a higher disparity than in many other Western nations. The report highlights the need for better language support, recognition of foreign qualifications, and other measures to improve economic integration.</p>

They warn that the push to slash regulations and speed up plant approvals threatens the independence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the agency tasked with ensuring public safety. Former NRC chairs argue that Trump is misplacing blame on the regulator for the industry's high costs and that compromising the NRC's independence could increase the risk of a nuclear accident. The orders call for a staff reduction and a wholesale revision of regulations, which critics say is imprudent.</p>

The dog, named Susan after Clapper's late wife, was trained to protect agency personnel. However, Clapper was disinvited at the last minute, with the CIA citing a presidential executive order that had previously stripped his security clearance. The author frames this as a petty and personal act of retribution by the Trump administration against a figure associated with the "deep state," illustrating a focus on political payback.</p>
