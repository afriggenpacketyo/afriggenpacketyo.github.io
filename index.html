          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to unveil a substantial Â£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure across England, targeting mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. Tram projects will receive significant funding, with Greater Manchester slated for Â£2.5 billion to extend its network and the West Midlands allocated Â£2.4 billion to expand services in Birmingham. Six additional metro mayors will also benefit from these investments, aimed at improving connectivity and driving economic growth in these regions. This initiative marks a shift from the Treasury's traditional Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East, with Reeves emphasizing the need to address regional disparities and open up access to jobs.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump stated that reaching a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping is proving to be "extremely hard," amidst White House suggestions of potential talks between the two leaders this week. This announcement follows U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's acknowledgement of stalled trade discussions, hinting that the leaders' intervention might be necessary. Trump conveyed his sentiment via Truth Social, underscoring the challenges in negotiations, while China has criticized the U.S. for actions limiting China's access to advanced technology. The article suggests Beijing is trying to foster trust so that Xi Jinping doesn't get blindsided by Trump's words or actions after the call.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% has taken effect, impacting European steel exporters while granting the U.K. a temporary exemption. The U.K. maintains a 25% tariff while details of the recently signed "Economic Prosperity Deal" are finalized, though Trump warned this could increase to 50% if the U.K. doesn't comply with the agreement. UK Steel's Director-General Gareth Stace expressed cautious optimism, noting the exemption provides a "welcome pause" but uncertainty remains, potentially affecting customer orders. The trade body urges both London and Washington to finalize the trade deal to eliminate tariffs completely, as these levies come at a challenging time for the steel industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a surge in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. This rebound contrasts with declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, with Australian sales jumping to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to a 122.5% year-over-year increase in Model Y sales. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year, with increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities impacting global sales. While the Australian rebound is encouraging locally, it doesn't necessarily signal a broader global recovery for Tesla.</p>

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, intensifying trade war concerns as the move casts a shadow over an OECD ministerial gathering. This action impacts allies and adversaries alike, straining relationships with trading partners and prompting negotiations to avert the duties. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to the Trump levies, with chief economist Alvaro Pereira warning that the U.S. economy will face the biggest repercussions.

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city, required the closure of several roads and the evacuation of hotels, care homes, and the railway station in Deutz. The Cologne Cathedral was situated just outside the danger zone. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the city being a major target for Allied forces during WWII.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, aiming to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue these protections could harm steel producers outside the US, provoke retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American metal users. The UK has been temporarily exempted, maintaining a 25% tariff while trade discussions with the US continue. Economists warn that the increased tariffs could lead to job losses in other sectors due to rising prices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has known since the beginning that the Â£2.35 billion from the Chelsea sale might not reach Ukraine, according to an official involved in the deal with Roman Abramovich. The delay stems from disagreements over how the funds should be used, with Abramovich wanting to include victims from Russia, which the government opposes. Despite a House of Lords committee deeming the delay "incomprehensible," legal action has only recently been threatened, raising concerns about further delays and potential legal battles.

          <p>Karen Read's defense team's decision not to call her to the witness stand in her murder trial presents a significant gamble. The prosecution played damaging interview clips, allowing the jury to hear Readâ€™s version of events, but without cross-examination. Legal experts suggest this choice aims to prevent Read from being questioned about her statements, which could potentially damage her character. However, it also prevents her from directly clarifying her side of the story and explaining her statements to the jury.</p>
