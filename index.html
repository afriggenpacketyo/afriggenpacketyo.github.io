          <p>The deadline set by President Donald Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face potential "secondary sanctions" has now passed. These sanctions would target countries purchasing Russian oil. Uncertainty remains about the administration's next steps, especially with discussions of a potential bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin. The president has expressed increasing frustration with the lack of progress, having previously shortened his ultimatum timeline from 50 days to just 10, highlighting the escalating diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has taken over the investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows calls for transparency, as the force was initially investigating its own former officers. Five women who were victims of grooming gangs reported that they were also abused by police. The NCA has stated its commitment to ensuring the victims remain the central focus of the investigation, in which three former officers have been arrested.</p>

Despite expecting substantial losses, the company's annual recurring revenue is projected to exceed $20 billion this year, and it is reportedly in talks for a new stock sale at a valuation around $500 billion.</p>

Nwaneri famously became the youngest player in Premier League history in 2022 at the age of 15. During a breakout campaign last season, he made 37 appearances and scored nine goals across all competitions for the Gunners.

          <p>Iran is reportedly planning to integrate with China's BeiDou satellite navigation system to address security vulnerabilities, a move that could expand Beijing's technological influence in the Middle East. The decision comes after Iran experienced significant military and nuclear facility losses during a recent conflict with Israel and the US. Iranian officials stated the shift is a strategic decision to reduce reliance on Western technology, which they feel has been a "bitter experience." The plan involves migrating key national services, like transportation and agriculture, to the Chinese system.</p>

          <p>Israel's decision to take military control of Gaza City is being met with despair, as it signals a devastating new phase of the war for the estimated one million civilians still residing there. Many had returned to the city after a previous ceasefire, only to find their homes destroyed and now face another forced evacuation. The plan raises serious questions about where displaced civilians will go, as other southern cities like Rafah have been largely obliterated. This move presents a significant risk for Prime Minister Netanyahu's government and suggests a grim, repetitive cycle of displacement and destruction for Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Robert Gordon, the former Michigan state health director who oversaw the implementation of Medicaid work requirements, is warning other states about the potential for massive coverage losses. In 2020, Michigan spent $30 million on a system that was on track to remove up to 100,000 people from health insurance before a federal court blocked the policy. With a new federal law expanding these mandates, Gordon cautions that even with diligent implementation, such systems are administratively wasteful and inevitably cause large numbers of vulnerable people to fall through the cracks and lose essential healthcare coverage.</p>

          <p>Political observers are concerned that a recent constitutional change in Togo could serve as a blueprint for extending authoritarian rule elsewhere in Africa. President Faure Gnassingbe stepped down but assumed a newly created, unelected role as president of the Council of Ministers, retaining most presidential powers. This move, labeled a "constitutional coup" by critics, allows him to rule indefinitely without facing a direct election, continuing his family's 58-year dynasty. The development is seen as part of a worrying trend where leaders amend constitutions to cling to power, undermining democratic processes and shrinking civic space.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, claiming he is "highly conflicted," which caused a dip in the company's stock. The call follows a letter from Republican Senator Tom Cotton raising concerns about Tan's investments and alleged ties to Chinese companies, including some with links to the Chinese military. In response, Intel released a letter from Tan to employees in which he reaffirmed his commitment to the company and stated he has always operated with the highest legal and ethical standards, pushing back against what he called "misinformation."</p>

          <p>The Israeli Security Cabinet has officially approved a plan for the nation's military to take control of Gaza City, marking a significant expansion of the war. The Prime Minister's office stated the plan is part of five principles for ending the conflict, which include disarming Hamas and establishing a new civil government. The decision formalizes Prime Minister Netanyahu's previously stated intention to take control of the entire Gaza Strip but hand its governance over to "Arab forces." This move is expected to draw strong international opposition amid growing concerns over the humanitarian crisis in the territory.</p>

          <p>Top global insurers like Allianz and Zurich are warning that the escalating climate crisis could soon make entire regions uninsurable, threatening the stability of financial services like mortgages that depend on insurance coverage. An Allianz board member noted that the world is heading towards a 2.7 to 3-degree temperature increase, a level where adaptation becomes impossible and assets degrade in real time. With the "protection gap" already leaving two-thirds of natural catastrophe losses uninsured, insurers fear that escalating risks will make premiums unaffordable, potentially destroying the economic systems they are designed to protect.</p>

          <p>Bao Fan, the prominent founder of investment bank China Renaissance, has reportedly been released after being detained for over two years to "cooperate" in an unspecified investigation by mainland authorities. His sudden disappearance in early 2023 sent shockwaves through China's business community. During his absence, Bao resigned from his roles at the company but remains its controlling shareholder. The news of his release could bring some stability to the Hong Kong-listed firm, whose stock price rose significantly following the report from Chinese financial media outlet Caixin.</p>

          <p>Viktoriia Roshchyna, a 27-year-old Ukrainian journalist, was buried in Kyiv after dying in Russian captivity. Roshchyna, who reported from occupied territories, was captured two years ago and died last autumn during a prison transfer; her body was returned to Ukraine in February. An investigation by Ukrainian authorities found numerous signs of torture and abuse on her body, and a criminal investigation for war crimes has been launched. Roshchyna, who was posthumously awarded Ukraine's Order of Freedom for her courage, is one of 29 Ukrainian media workers currently believed to be held in Russian captivity.</p>

          <h2>CNBC Survey Shows Trump's Approval Ratings Remain Negative as Public View of Democratic Party Worsens</h2>

          <p>A new CNBC survey indicates that President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain negative, with 51% of the public disapproving of his job performance. However, the poll also shows a significant decline in the favorability of the Democratic Party, which has sunk to a net -32 rating, potentially its lowest in decades. On specific issues, Trump's handling of the southern border receives positive marks, but he is underwater on inflation, federal spending, and taxes. The survey reveals a complex political landscape with dissatisfaction directed at both the president and the opposition party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared with President Donald Trump to announce a plan to spend $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as an effort to appease the administration's push for American manufacturing. While Cook did not commit to the final assembly of iPhones in the U.S., he highlighted that key components like glass and sensors are already made by American suppliers. The announcement, which included an exemption for Apple from new chip tariffs, was viewed by experts as a savvy maneuver to avoid political pressure while symbolically supporting U.S. jobs and production.</p>
