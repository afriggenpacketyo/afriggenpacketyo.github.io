          <h2>VP Vance Clarifies U.S. Objective in Iran Strikes: Targeting Nuclear Program, Not War</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. military action in Iran is aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear program, not engaging in a broader war. Vance stated that the strikes had substantially set back Iran's nuclear capabilities, potentially delaying their ability to develop nuclear weapons for years. While unable to definitively confirm the complete destruction of Iran's facilities, Vance assured that Iran is significantly further from a nuclear program than before, emphasizing the precision and narrow focus of the operation. Vance also addressed the possibility of Iranian retaliation, asserting that the U.S. would respond with overwhelming force, and reiterated that the administration's goal is not regime change but the elimination of Iran's nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>According to reports, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not participate in potential negotiations with the United States in Turkey and remained in hiding during U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. President Trump, coordinating with Turkish President ErdoÄŸan, offered to meet with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to the Israel-Iran war and a nuclear deal. Khamenei's absence and silence on social media since the strikes suggest a lack of engagement in diplomacy, leading to the U.S. taking military action. Iran expert Lisa Daftari asserts that diplomacy was never viable with Iran's regime, built on hostility towards the U.S. and Israel, stating that Trump ultimately made the right decision to act with limited, precise military strikes to send a clear message.</p>

          <p>Senator Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, emphasized the need for the United States to be prepared for potential Iranian retaliation following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Cotton highlighted Iran's history of targeting Americans and their interests globally, stressing that any Iranian military action against Americans would be met with overwhelming force. He noted that while the full damage assessment of the strikes is still underway, there is no doubt that Iran's critical nuclear infrastructure has been severely damaged. Cotton also stated that the U.S. is not seeking regime change in Iran, but rather the elimination of their nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>This article details the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, with President Trump claiming the facilities were "obliterated" and Israel confirming coordination with the U.S. The operation, dubbed "Midnight Hammer," involved 125 U.S. military aircraft, including B-2 stealth bombers, and Tomahawk cruise missiles, targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Gen. Dan Caine noted the use of deception tactics and the dropping of 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators on Fordo. Initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites, with satellite imagery showing craters at Fordo. While Iran downplays the damage, Saudi Arabia and the IAEA report no increase in radiation levels, but Iran launched missiles at Tel Aviv and Haifa shortly after the U.S. strikes.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, described President Trump's strikes on Iran as a "massive gamble," emphasizing that the impact on Iran's nuclear program remains uncertain. Himes voiced concern over the lack of congressional approval for the strikes, highlighting the Constitution's mandate that Congress alone holds the power to declare war. He acknowledged the possibility of a best-case scenario but cautioned that historical precedent suggests U.S. military involvements in the region often lead to worst-case outcomes. Himes painted a dire picture of potential consequences, including the loss of American lives and the relocation of nuclear materials.</p>

          <p>According to sources, some Iranian businessmen, political and military figures, and relatives of high-ranking clerics were developing a plan to run Iran without Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei before the U.S. strikes. The plan involves a leadership committee taking over and negotiating a deal with the U.S. to halt Israeli attacks. Hassan Rouhani is being considered for a key role, and some military officials have been in contact with counterparts from a major Gulf country. Despite the uncertainty, some insiders believe the chances of sidelining Khamenei have increased, while others fear the opposite outcome. The extent of damage from the U.S. strikes is debated, with some wanting a deal with Trump and others advocating for retaliation.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Iran's potential strategic responses to the U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear sites, outlining three main options. The first option is to retaliate swiftly and forcefully, targeting U.S. bases or naval assets in the Middle East, or disrupting shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, which carries over 20% of the world's oil supply. The second option is to retaliate later, launching a surprise attack when tensions have subsided and U.S. forces are less alert. The third option is not to retaliate, which could spare Iran from further U.S. attacks but might weaken the regime's standing. The article suggests that Iran's decision will depend on balancing the risks of escalation with the need to maintain its credibility and regional influence.</p>

          <h2>Gulf Markets Show Limited Reaction to U.S. Strike on Iran</h2>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East showed resilience following the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, fueled by expectations that Washington's intervention might expedite the conflict's resolution. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul initially rose before declining slightly, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 experienced a notable increase. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's diplomatic stance, advocating for peaceful resolution and distancing itself from the conflict, has shielded it from significant market turmoil. The market may be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat, potentially benefiting international investors.</p>

          <p>A National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While no specific threats are noted, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks against U.S. networks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. The advisory also highlights the risk of violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators being motivated to attack targets due to the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. The bulletin is designed to communicate threat information and resources for staying safe during the heightened threat environment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine revealed that the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved "misdirection" and decoys to maintain secrecy. Decoy B-2 stealth bombers were deployed over the Pacific to divert attention, while the actual bombers flew under the cover of darkness for 18 hours. A total of 14 bunker buster bombs were dropped, and a U.S. submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at key surface targets. The operation was described as a complex and high-risk mission that relied on operational security to achieve surprise.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people after the U.S. joined Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian missiles struck Haifa, Tel Aviv, Be'er Yaakov, and Nes Ziona, causing damage to buildings and trapping people under rubble. The IDF reported that Iran launched approximately 30 missiles at Israel. Israel responded by striking dozens of missile and drone sites in Iran, including a strategic missile command center. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion," Iran has fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel, resulting in 24 deaths.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's decision to bomb nuclear sites in Iran without congressional approval undermines American democracy. The author contrasts this with George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq, where Congress authorized military force, allowing for public debate and accountability. By bypassing Congress, Trump deprived citizens of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. The author suggests that this trend of unilateral action is dangerous and could lead to radicalization if citizens lack official channels to express their opposition to war.</p>
