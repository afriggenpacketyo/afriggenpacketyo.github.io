            <p>Yi Shouliang, a senior scientist formerly at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory and an adjunct professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has left the United States to take a role at Sichuan University in China. This decision follows escalating tensions between the U.S. and China, leading him to dissolve his commercial ventures and resign from his academic post after less than a year. Yi's research at NETL focused on developing materials for carbon capture and water management, although his name is not currently listed on official DOE websites. The circumstances of his departure remain undisclosed, but his move highlights the impact of geopolitical tensions on scientific careers.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors and defense attorneys presented closing arguments in the bribery trial of Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, who was previously sentenced to 11 years in prison. Prosecutors argued that Nadine acted as a broker, selling her husband's influence for personal gain, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car. The defense countered that the government's definitions of "official acts" and "quid pro quo" were too broad, and questioned the credibility of a key government witness. The jury will now deliberate on the 18 charges against Nadine Menendez.</p>

            <p>A report from the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China's "Made in China 2025" plan has missed several key targets, despite some successes in achieving domestic dominance in sectors like autos. The plan, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in technology, has fostered unhealthy industrial competition and worsened global trade tensions. While China has excelled in shipbuilding, high-speed rail, and electric cars, it has fallen short in aerospace, high-end robots, and manufacturing value-added growth. The U.S. has responded by restricting China's access to high-end tech and encouraging domestic manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Florida State University students and parents described fear and confusion during the campus shooting, as the campus went into lockdown. Students sheltering in place shared their experiences, while parents struggled to reach their children and sort fact from fiction. One father recalled painful memories of his son sheltering in place during the 2018 Parkland High School shooting. The shooting resulted in two deaths and several injuries, leaving the community in shock and mourning.</p>

            <p>The U.S. is implementing port fees on Chinese ships to revive shipbuilding in the U.S. and challenge China's dominance. The fees, based on cargo weight and container numbers, will be charged once per voyage, up to five times a year. The move comes amid concerns that the measures could disrupt global trade. Trump's tariffs have already caused significant build-ups of ships, especially in the European Union, and increased congestion at UK ports, potentially raising prices for consumers.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has accepted an invitation for a state visit to the UK in September, which could be crucial for a special relationship under strain. The visit, described by Trump as a "fest," is seen as a chance for British soft power to influence the president. Despite risks and potential protests, officials believe Trump's fondness for the Royal Family and pomp could provide vital diplomatic clout amidst ongoing tensions over trade and international issues.</p>

The charges include stalking, firearms offenses, and murder through use of a firearm, making him eligible for the death penalty. Attorney General Pamela Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, the first time it has been sought since the Biden administration placed a moratorium on federal executions. Mangione also faces charges in Pennsylvania and New York.</p>

            <p>Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has halted an offshore wind project near Long Island, citing insufficient analysis. Equinor, the project's owner, is complying with the order and suspending construction.
