          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a massive, fictitious music festival called Monmouth Rising, orchestrated by a convicted fraudster named James Kenny. The event falsely advertised major headliners like The Killers and claimed to be the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, deceiving employees, suppliers, and even drawing in a government's name. Kenny, operating from his mother's kitchen, used alleged forgeries and false promises of investment to build the sham event, leaving many unpaid and highlighting vulnerabilities within the festival industry. He has since apologized but faces legal action from those affected.</p>

          <p>Arkansas State Police are investigating the deaths of a 43-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman as a potential double homicide after their bodies were discovered on a walking trail in Devil's Den State Park. Authorities were called to the scene on Saturday afternoon and are now searching for a suspect described as a white male in a dark, four-door sedan. The suspect's vehicle was seen leaving the park and may have had its license plate covered with tape.

          <p>The United States swim team is grappling with an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore, impacting several athletes' performances. The illness, which originated during a pre-competition training camp in Thailand, has forced key swimmers like Torri Huske and Claire Weinstein to withdraw from events. Despite the health challenges affecting some members, other top athletes like Katie Ledecky have continued to compete, posting strong qualifying times. The situation adds a layer of difficulty for Team USA as it aims to improve upon its performance from the recent Paris Games.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to licensing rules to shield pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing the struggling hospitality sector. The reforms would require developers building near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing and would fast-track permissions for new businesses in designated areas. This initiative seeks to reverse the trend of pub closures by making it easier to operate and expand, particularly with outdoor dining and drinking. While the government touts the plan as cutting red tape, the opposition has criticized it as hypocritical given other tax policies affecting the industry.</p>

Trump has given Russia a 50-day deadline to reach a peace deal, threatening "very severe" sanctions and tariffs up to 100% if it fails to comply, while also tying further U.S. aid for Ukraine to payments from NATO allies. Analysts are skeptical that these threats will compel Russia to negotiate in good faith, as the Kremlin may be banking on the U.S. being unable to sustain pressure. This new dynamic leaves both Russia and Ukraine in a precarious position, with Kyiv facing internal political pressures and a more transactional form of international support.

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become a stand-up comedy sensation by telling jokes about her abusive ex-husband and the patriarchal norms she faced. Her performances, which mix humor and tragedy, have resonated deeply with audiences but have also drawn the attention of Chinese officials. A local government department issued a warning against jokes that "provoke gender conflict," seen as a veiled critique of Fan's viral routine. Her rise highlights the power of comedy as an outlet for grievances in China, while also showing the government's sensitivity to feminist discourse.</p>

          <p>Four people in Fort White, Florida, have been arrested on charges of aggravated child abuse after authorities discovered nine children were being subjected to horrific conditions. The accused, including a husband and wife, allegedly kept some of the children in plywood cages under bunk beds, beat them with canes, and sprayed vinegar in their faces as punishment. Prosecutors claim the four adopted children in the home were treated more harshly than the five biological children and were forced to lie about the abuse. An investigation was launched after a church member reported concerns, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Official's Remarks on Ancient Kingdoms Rekindle Historical Sensitivities with South Korea</h2>

          <p>A senior Chinese official's call to emphasize the Chinese identity of ancient kingdoms has raised concerns about reigniting historical and diplomatic tensions with South Korea. Huang Qiang, the party chief of Jilin province, urged scholars to clearly present the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms as part of China's history. These kingdoms, known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae, are a cornerstone of Korean history and identity, and their historical interpretation has long been a point of contention between the two nations. The remarks highlight the ongoing sensitivity of historical narratives in shaping modern geopolitical relationships in the region.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Citizens Push Back Online as Government Suppresses Coverage of Deadly Mass Attacks</h2>

          <p>China's government is increasingly censoring news about mass attacks, such as stabbings or vehicle rammings, in an effort to control information and prevent potential unrest. After several recent incidents, official reports have been minimal or non-existent, and online photos and discussions have been scrubbed from the internet. However, some Chinese citizens are pushing back on social media, demanding transparency and criticizing the information blackout. This trend reflects the tightening grip of state control under Xi Jinping but also shows a growing public desire for the truth when local authorities attempt to cover up negative news.</p>

          <p>Sudan's civil war has deepened as the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) announced the formation of a rival, civilian-led government, a move that threatens to permanently fracture the country. The new administration names RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president and challenges the legitimacy of the internationally recognized army-led government. This development stokes fears of an escalated conflict and further fragmentation, undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve the 27-month war. The country is now effectively split, with the army and the RSF controlling different territories, exacerbating a devastating humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has intervened in the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, stating that both nations agreed to meet for a ceasefire after he called their leaders. The leaders of both countries thanked him for his efforts, with Cambodia accepting the ceasefire request and Thailand emphasizing the need for dialogue first. Despite the diplomatic intervention, reports indicate that shelling continued along the border overnight, where clashes have killed at least 33 people and displaced thousands. The situation remains tense, with Trump's involvement coming just before U.S. tariffs on both nations are set to take effect.</p>

          <p>Turkey has officially recorded its highest temperature ever, hitting 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. This new record comes as a severe heatwave grips much of the eastern Mediterranean, with temperatures across Turkey soaring up to 12 degrees Celsius above seasonal averages. The extreme heat, combined with strong winds and dry conditions, has fueled dozens of disastrous wildfires across the country, forcing evacuations and resulting in multiple fatalities. The situation highlights the severe impact of extreme weather events in the region, which are also affecting neighboring countries like Greece.</p>

          <p>Despite the Dodgers taking an early lead with two first-inning home runs, Boston Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet delivered a dominant performance to lead his team to a 4-2 victory. Crochet struck out ten batters over six innings, effectively shutting down the Dodgers' offense after the initial surge. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled to hold the lead, giving up three runs in the second inning and ultimately taking the loss. The game was a showcase of Crochet's resilience and a frustrating night for the Dodgers, who were unable to capitalize on early momentum against the MLB strikeout leader.</p>

          <p>Greece is struggling to contain five major wildfires across the country, fanned by a severe heatwave and strong winds, with one blaze forcing evacuations just 30 kilometers from Athens.
