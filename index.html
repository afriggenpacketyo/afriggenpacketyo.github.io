          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to extend a deadline to negotiate tariffs with the European Union until 9 July. Speaking to reporters, Trump said Von der Leyen told him "we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out", posting later on Truth Social that it was his "privilege to extend the deadline". Last month, Trump announced a 20% tariff on most EU goods, but later halved it to 10% until 8 July to allow time for negotiations. On Friday, Trump expressed frustration with the pace of negotiations with the EU and threatened to impose 50% tariffs.</p>

Four days later, he lowered this to 10%, with the threat that he'd hike it back up again to 20% in July, depending on how trade negotiations pan out. French winemakers are walking on eggshells at the moment, fearful of saying anything that might aggravate the situation.</p>
