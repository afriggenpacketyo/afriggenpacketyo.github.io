            <p>Three former Department of Defense aides, recently dismissed amid leak concerns, have publicly questioned their abrupt terminations, stating they were given minimal information regarding the investigation. The aides, veterans of military service, expressed disappointment and refuted claims of character slander by unnamed Pentagon officials. Despite the circumstances, they voiced continued support for the Trump-Vance Administration's goals for the Pentagon and national security. The aides claim that they are unaware of what they are being investigated for, if there is even an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders." The IDF stated that troops mistakenly believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces, compounded by poor night visibility that prevented them from identifying the vehicles as ambulances. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The incident occurred in a hostile combat zone, according to the IDF, who also claimed that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim which remains unsubstantiated.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" start to economic activity followed by a summer slowdown. Businesses and consumers are preemptively purchasing goods to avoid potential tariff increases, which may inflate economic activity in April but lead to a drop-off later. Sectors like the auto industry, heavily reliant on imported components, are likely to stockpile inventory. Goolsbee remains optimistic about the long-term economic outlook, citing steady employment and decreasing inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, who visited El Salvador to meet Kilmar Ábrego García, stated his trip was to support Ábrego García’s right to due process, emphasizing that denying it threatens everyone’s constitutional rights. The White House claims Ábrego García is an MS-13 gang member, though he hasn't been charged with related crimes. Van Hollen said the administration hasn’t presented evidence linking Ábrego García to MS-13 in federal court. He accused administration officials of lying to distract from questions about whether his rights were violated when deported.</p>
