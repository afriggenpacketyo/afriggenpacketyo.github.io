          <p>A Los Angeles judge has agreed to consider resentencing Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are currently serving life sentences for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents in Beverly Hills. The brothers admitted to the killings but claim they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, arguing they have since been rehabilitated. Prosecutors, however, maintain that the brothers meticulously planned the murders to gain access to their parents' fortune and have not taken responsibility for their actions, opposing their release. The judge's decision opens the possibility for the brothers to be released on parole, pending further legal proceedings and evaluations.</p>

          <p>José Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known for his humble lifestyle and leftist ideals, has died at the age of 89. Serving from 2010 to 2015, Mujica refused a presidential salary and estate, choosing to live on a farm and donate most of his income to housing for the poor. As a former member of the Tupamaro guerrilla movement, he spent over a decade in prison before entering mainstream politics. During his presidency, Uruguay legalized gay marriage, abortion, and marijuana, solidifying his legacy as a progressive leader.

It highlights the Democratic Party's reluctance to publicly address Biden's waning abilities and the efforts of his inner circle to control information flow. The book also suggests that outsiders were often shocked by Biden's condition, but their concerns were largely ignored by those closest to him.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods, resulting from a recent US-China trade truce, are causing Chinese car-parts makers to reassess plans for building production facilities in the US. The US agreed to reduce tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days, offering a temporary reprieve for vendors who export nearly 100 billion yuan worth of auto parts to the US annually. However, the uncertainty surrounding potential tariff increases after the 90-day period is hindering long-term investment decisions for both Chinese vendors and American customers.</p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, suggesting Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to Arab countries for civilian use. This proposal, intended as a permanent solution, seeks to alleviate concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and offers a potential framework for a new agreement with the United States.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's Office claims that President Trump's tariff policies will reduce state revenues by $16 billion through next year. Despite higher-than-expected tax receipts, the administration predicts lower overall revenues due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Newsom announced this information ahead of his revised 2025-26 state budget plan, seeking to attribute the state's expected revenue shortfall to Trump's policies. California filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump lacks the authority to impose these tariffs and will seek a preliminary injunction to freeze them.</p>
