          <h2>US Aluminum Tariffs Fail to Revive Domestic Production Due to High Energy Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 06:15:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite tariffs imposed on imported aluminum by the U.S. government, domestic aluminum production has not revived due to soaring electricity prices. These high energy costs, particularly in comparison to competitors in Canada and the Middle East, have led to smelter closures rather than restarts. The tariffs are primarily causing higher prices for U.S. consumers as companies pass on the increased costs, with the tech sector further exacerbating the problem by competing for energy resources. This article highlights the failure of tariffs to achieve their intended goal and the resulting economic consequences for U.S. consumers.</p>

          <p>Despite claims to the contrary during his campaign, President Trump's policies are closely aligned with Project 2025, a conservative agenda from the Heritage Foundation. The article details how Trump has pursued aggressive immigration enforcement, downsized the federal workforce, restricted transgender rights, and implemented protectionist trade measures, mirroring the recommendations of Project 2025. Critics warn that these policies threaten democracy and push the U.S. towards an authoritarian, Christian nationalist regime, while supporters celebrate Trump's fulfillment of campaign promises.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are expressing concern over President Trump's cuts to federal funding for addiction treatment programs, despite recent declines in fatal opioid overdoses in California. The cuts include rescinding harm reduction grants and terminating substance abuse prevention funding, jeopardizing efforts to increase naloxone availability and fentanyl testing. At the same time, local authorities are re-embracing a more traditional approach to fighting crime, including pursuing longer prison sentences for drug offenders. The article examines the potential consequences of these policy shifts on the ongoing opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>Advocacy groups are suing the Trump administration over new regulations that have prolonged the detention of migrant children and separated them from their families. The new rules require families to provide proof of income, U.S. identification, and often DNA tests, creating significant hurdles for undocumented family members. As a result, the length of time children remain in custody has tripled, leading to concerns about their mental health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's targeting of political opponents through law enforcement is not a new phenomenon but rather an escalation of a trend that began under previous administrations. The author suggests that unilateral disarmament in the face of an insatiable foe is a strategic failure and that both sides of the political divide must accept a paradigm of mutually assured destruction to restore normalcy in law enforcement relations. The piece contends that a short-term escalation may be necessary to achieve long-term stasis.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the White House's exploration of policies to boost America's low birth rate, including a baby bonus. It argues that while a baby bonus might provide short-term relief, it's not enough to address the systemic neglect of child care, maternity leave, and child poverty. The author advocates for paid parental leave, expanded public child care, and a renewed expansion of the child tax credit as more effective ways to support mothers and promote thriving families. The article emphasizes that investing in mothers from pregnancy through childbirth and across the years of raising children is essential.</p>

          <p>This article critiques President Trump's suggestion that Americans should accept fewer consumer goods due to his tariff policies. The author argues that Trump's rhetoric, which frames scarcity as a virtue, is hypocritical given his own luxurious lifestyle and his campaign promises to lower prices. The piece contends that Americans are unlikely to embrace austerity and that Trump's attempt to normalize the consequences of his policies will face resistance. It suggests that instead of lowering expectations, Trump should focus on providing more choices for the American people.</p>
