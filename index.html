        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An armored truck transporting eight million dimes experienced a rollover accident on U.S. Route 287 in Alvord, Texas, resulting in a significant spill of freshly minted coins. The incident led to the closure of southbound lanes for approximately 14 hours as cleanup crews used vacuum trucks and manual labor to recover the scattered dimes. While initial rumors suggested $8 million had spilled, the actual amount was $800,000. Despite the potential for a public frenzy, local residents did not rush to collect the coins, and the highway was eventually cleared after the rain washed away any remaining change, as the truck was transporting the freshly minted coins for the U.S. Mint.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New vehicle sales in the U.S. experienced a significant surge in March, driven by consumers hoping to avoid anticipated price increases due to new tariffs. Sales jumped more than 17% from February and nearly 12% from March of the previous year. However, economists caution that this surge may lead to lower sales later in the year as demand is pulled forward. A 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts took effect on April 3, prompting dealerships to stock up in anticipation of higher prices, and President Trump is expected to give relief to U.S. automakers by ensuring they are not also levied with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student with a green card, was released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order, after being detained when he went to his U.S. citizenship interview. Mahdawi's attorneys argued that the Trump administration was seeking to deport him in retaliation for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on campus, violating his First Amendment rights. The judge agreed that Mahdawi had made substantial claims that his detention was a result of retaliation for protected speech, comparing the situation to the Red Scare. The Justice Department plans to appeal the court order, but Mahdawi remains free while his immigration case continues.</p>

          <p>Russell Defreitas, a New York drug kingpin, received a 53-year prison sentence after being convicted of operating as a major drug trafficker, involved in a cocaine and fentanyl trafficking operation that led to two overdose deaths. Defreitas directed his associates not to call 911 when a female overdosed in a hotel room, removing drugs and evidence before going to Wendy's. Hours later, when 911 was called, both victims had fatally overdosed. Authorities found drugs, firearms, and other incriminating evidence in Defreitas' trailer and hotel room, prompting the Suffolk County District Attorney to advocate for stronger legislation, such as Chelsey's Law, to hold dealers accountable for overdose deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Senate effort to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, with Republicans largely opposing the measure, highlighting divisions over the potential economic impact of the tariffs. The resolution, led by Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency declaration used to impose the tariffs, but fell short of the necessary votes. The vote came after President Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners, later pausing most new tariffs for 90 days while increasing levies on goods imported from China. Despite anxieties over the tariffs' economic impact, House Republican leadership has taken steps to prevent efforts to block them.</p>

Microsoft's optimistic forecast offered relief to investors concerned about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on tech businesses. CEO Satya Nadella reiterated plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, requiring significant imports, but the company expects to manage costs effectively, though the company now expects to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly contacted Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele regarding the detention of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The nature of the discussion is unclear, but it follows a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" Ábrego García's release and return to the U.S. to face immigration proceedings. Bukele rejected the outreach, and the administration's reluctance to comply with the court order has been viewed as a test of presidential power. The Justice Department faces scrutiny regarding its efforts to comply with the Supreme Court ruling, with Ábrego García's lawyers seeking to depose administration officials.</p>

The judge referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings against Roman and Apple. The ruling accuses Apple of anticompetitive behavior and withholding documentation related to its compliance with the 2021 court order, which required Apple to allow developers to link to their websites for purchases outside of Apple's ecosystem. The judge ordered Apple to stop imposing commissions on web-based purchases and to pay Epic Games' attorney fees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with gross domestic product shrinking at an annual rate of 0.3%, primarily due to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's tariff policies. This slowdown comes amid growing concerns that the tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy and potentially lead to a recession. While the report may not fully reflect economic growth due to the surge in imports, it signals that businesses and consumers altered their behavior, creating headwinds for the economy. Another key measure of the economy's health, final sales to private domestic purchasers, rose 3%, suggesting demand remains resilient despite concerns.</p>

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs faced by landlords. The preliminary vote supports increases of between 1.75 and 4.75 percent on one-year leases and between 4.75 and 7.75 percent for two-year leases. Tenant advocates argue the increases will worsen the housing crisis, while landlords claim the adjustments are insufficient to cover rising expenses. The final decision is expected in the coming months and will affect stabilized leases starting on or after October 1. The board seeks to balance the interests of landlords and tenants, considering factors like employment trends, wages, and maintenance costs.</p>

          <p>Meta reported strong first-quarter earnings, with revenue up 16% from a year earlier, and profit up 35%, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined a plan to navigate President Trump's tariffs. The company's strategy includes leveraging AI to improve ads and increase user engagement, monetizing messaging apps, and investing in AI infrastructure. While Meta expects continued revenue growth, CFO Susan Li noted some Asian retailers have reduced ad spending in anticipation of the end of a U.S. trade loophole. The company also faces antitrust scrutiny and regulatory challenges in Europe, but remains optimistic about its business performance.</p>

Critics allege Scott participated in a cover-up and is unqualified to lead the agency, while his defenders say he acted appropriately. An international human rights commission found that the U.S. is responsible for Hernández Rojas’ killing and that a cover-up followed, calling on the U.S. to reopen the criminal investigation of the agents involved.

The administration has taken a hawkish approach to tariffs, using them to coerce foreign governments.

The Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats, but the Conservatives also made significant gains, preventing the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.
