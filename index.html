          <p>England's national football team is under fire following a defeat to Senegal, raising concerns about their prospects for the upcoming 2026 World Cup. Critics point to a lack of discernible plan, identity, and improvement since Thomas Tuchel took over as head coach. The team's performance in Euro 2024 was marked by individual moments rather than consistent performances, a trend that has continued under Tuchel. Despite mitigating circumstances such as numerous changes to the lineup and the friendly nature of the match, the defeat to Senegal has sparked alarm among fans and analysts.

          <p>New federal data reveals a significant drop in drug-related deaths among young people in the United States, particularly those involving fentanyl. This decline marks an unprecedented rate of lives saved each year. While fentanyl and other street drugs have claimed the lives of over 230,000 individuals under 35 in the past decade, recent trends indicate a positive shift. The factors driving this decrease are under investigation, and concerns remain about the potential impact of federal funding cuts on these positive trends.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations have erupted in Los Angeles in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to clashes between protesters and police. Tensions escalated after President Trump deployed the National Guard over the objections of state and city leaders. The protests began following ICE raids at businesses suspected of unlawfully employing undocumented immigrants, sparking outrage and calls for an end to the operations. The situation has drawn condemnation from local officials and ignited solidarity protests in other cities across the country.</p>

          <p>Recent demonstrations in Los Angeles against immigration-enforcement operations may represent the first mass movement against the second Trump administration. While some worry that these protests could lead to violence or be seen as unpatriotic, large-scale demonstrations have historically been effective in challenging government policies. Trump's decision to deploy the military to quell the protests indicates a weak sway over the public. The article suggests that the anti-Trump movement can focus on its core values rather than trying to predict Trump's reactions.</p>

Despite Beijing's efforts to encourage private sector participation in defense orders, state-owned conglomerates continue to dominate the sector.
