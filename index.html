          <p>President Trump's efforts to shift the focus away from the nation's racial past are facing resistance from those determined to preserve it. While the administration has attempted to cut funding for cultural institutions focused on Black history, some efforts have been reversed. The article notes that historical sites dedicated to Black history and visitors will have their say, despite the administration's attempts to warp historical narratives around race. The article cites the executive director of the Whitney Plantation, Ashley Rogers, who called Trump's condemnation of "improper ideology" Orwellian.</p>

          <p>Tesla sales in Germany and Britain experienced significant declines in April, reflecting a broader trend of waning European demand for the U.S. automaker. Experts suggest that the backlash against President Trump's tariffs and anger towards Elon Musk's political views are contributing to the drop. Chinese-made electric vehicles are gaining popularity in Europe, while German automaker Volkswagen has seen a recovery. The article indicates that Tesla's European challenges may be more deeply rooted than a simple model changeover.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to enforce its policy barring transgender people from serving in the military while legal proceedings continue. The decision pauses a lower court order that had blocked the ban nationwide. The policy targets active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria, citing concerns about military readiness and cohesion. The move has been met with criticism from LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, who argue that the policy is discriminatory.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the ancient ChavÃ­n people in the Peruvian Andes likely used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," containing traces of DMT and tobacco at ChavÃ­n de HuÃ¡ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found suggests that only select members of the ChavÃ­n society participated in these rituals. The study provides material evidence that hallucinogens were a focal point of these gatherings.</p>
