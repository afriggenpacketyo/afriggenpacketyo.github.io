            <p>China is responding to U.S. tariff hikes by targeting the American services sector and implementing non-tariff restrictive measures. This includes widening export controls on rare-earth minerals, initiating antitrust probes into American companies like DuPont and Google, and restricting or banning firms from trading with or investing in China. Beijing has also reportedly ordered Chinese airlines to halt further deliveries of Boeing jets and cease purchases of aircraft-related equipment from U.S. companies, escalating trade tensions beyond tariffs. These actions signal a decoupling of the two economies and create various levels of pain for U.S. companies.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is targeting AmeriCorps' National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), a 30-year-old community service program, as part of its effort to slash government spending. Volunteers were informed that they would exit the program early due to the administration's priorities and an executive order creating the Department of Government Efficiency. The program, which employs over 2,000 young adults, focuses on projects related to education, housing, disaster relief, and more. Funding for AmeriCorps and NCCC has long been scrutinized during budget discussions, with NCCC receiving nearly $38 million last fiscal year.</p>

He says the study, which found ultra-processed foods may not be addictive in the same way as drugs, was downplayed by Kennedy's spokesperson.

            <p>The case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a man deported from Maryland to El Salvador, has drawn national attention. The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation as an "administrative error," but alleges that García has ties to the MS-13 gang, a claim disputed by his attorneys. A judge has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, but the administration has pushed back, and El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not allow García to return to the US. The case raises questions about due process and the administration's immigration policies.</p>

            <p>Japan's export growth in March missed expectations, rising by only 3.9% compared to the previous year, indicating the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. While exports increased to the Middle East and the U.S., the growth was lower than anticipated, and the data does not fully reflect the impact of recent U.S. tariffs on auto imports, steel, and aluminum. Japan is currently engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S., with discussions focusing on tariffs, military support costs, and trade fairness.</p>
