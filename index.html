            <p>Following a freeway crash in Eagle Rock, three suspects fled into a nearby neighborhood, prompting a police search that led officers to a home where a 51-year-old woman, Jillian Shriner (wife of Weezer's bassist), was armed with a handgun. After refusing to drop the weapon and allegedly pointing it at officers, Shriner was shot in the shoulder and taken into custody. One of the original crash suspects was also arrested, while two remain at large, leading to a temporary closure of the freeway and neighborhood. Shriner faces attempted murder charges with a $1 million bail.</p>

            <p>Former England striker Eni Aluko has spoken out after winning the first stage of a High Court libel claim against Joey Barton, emphasizing the need for accountability regarding online abuse. Aluko, targeted by Barton on social media with comments about her race, gender, and past statements, hopes the judgment will encourage others to speak out against online harassment. The judge ruled Barton's comments were defamatory, and Aluko stressed the importance of changing the culture towards women in broadcasting and preventing free speech from being weaponized into hate speech. Barton has not yet responded and could appeal the ruling.</p>

            <p>Robert King, a 35-year-old Texas man, has been ordered to remain in jail after being charged with making online threats against ICE agents and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. King allegedly posted threatening messages on Facebook, including wishing a horrible demise for Noem and advocating for shooting ICE agents. Despite his attorney's argument about his mental health issues, the judge deemed him a flight risk and a danger to the community. King, who was living with his sister and brother-in-law (a former CBP agent), was arrested after his social media posts came to light through an FBI tip line.</p>

            <p>Next month's local elections in England, though often lacking the glamour of national polls, are crucial barometers of public sentiment and directly impact local services. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors across 23 local authorities, plus mayors for local and combined authorities. The elections serve as a test for the Conservative government and an opportunity for Labour to demonstrate its strength. Issues such as council tax increases and the state of local services will be key, with parties vying for control and voters seeking value for their money.</p>

            <p>The ex-partner of Kevin Booth, a millionaire horse racing tipster, has come forward with allegations of torture and abuse against women, warning that someone could die if he is not stopped. Tammy Conner, who claims she was beaten by Booth for four years starting at age 16, is speaking out in hopes that other women will come forward. Another woman, Marta, who worked for Booth, stated she had to sign a contract allowing him to "punish" her. Booth denies the allegations, but a civil court judge described footage he filmed as "utterly harrowing" and said his conduct amounted to "trafficking and exploitation."</p>

            <p>Court documents in a UK civil claim against Andrew Tate reveal detailed allegations of rape, assault, and coercive control by four women. The documents allege incidents that took place between 2013 and 2015, including claims that Tate pointed a gun at a woman, raped and strangled women, and made threats of violence. Tate denies the claims, calling them a "pack of lies" and "gross fabrications", and argues that too much time has passed for the women to take legal action.

            <p>Donald Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on various countries, are predicted to have far-reaching consequences on the global economy, including the UK. These actions threaten to disrupt deals, further undermine London's stock exchange, risk a rise in corruption, and increase prices for consumers. While the direct trade impact on the UK may be limited, the potential for soaring inflation, delayed stock market listings, and increased financial strain on companies like Thames Water pose significant challenges. Central banks are expected to cut rates to mitigate the economic fallout, but the overall outlook remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

A report by ING noted that current tariffs on Chinese products could generate substantial tax revenue but could also drop to zero if China ceases exports. The situation is described as chaotic and unpredictable, with the threat of higher tariffs from Trump still looming.</p>

            <p>The port of Duluth-Superior, a logistical and engineering marvel in the northernmost part of the United States, is on the frontline of the global trade war. The port generates $1.6 billion a year and supports over 7,000 jobs, but faces uncertainty due to trade tensions. Vessels are loaded and unloaded with products that make up the lifeblood of the global economy, including iron ore, cement, and grain. Farmers in the region, who largely voted for Trump, are anxious about the potential impact of tariffs on their livelihoods.</p>

The committee argues that this levy is needed to safeguard the creation of distinctly British content. The report notes a decline in domestic high-end TV productions in the UK and emphasizes the importance of dramas for the country's identity.
