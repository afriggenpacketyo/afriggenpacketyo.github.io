          <p>Suga, the final member of the K-Pop group BTS to complete South Korea's mandatory military service, has been discharged, paving the way for the band's potential reunion. Big Hit Music confirmed that Suga completed his alternative service on June 18 and his official discharge date was June 21. Suga expressed gratitude to fans for their patience and apologized for causing disappointment and concern last year, referencing a past drunk driving incident. The anticipation is high for BTS's comeback, as the group has been on a self-described "hiatus" since 2022 while members fulfilled their military duties, and they are expected to hold their largest-ever world tour in 2026.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, with £650 million invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The goal is to shift the NHS from a reactive service to one that proactively identifies and prevents health issues before symptoms appear. The screening will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using umbilical cord blood samples, looking for gene disorders that develop in early childhood and have effective treatments.</p>

          <p>Chinese brands, particularly in the electronics sector, are increasing their presence and appeal in the European market through strategic advertising and sports sponsorships. Xiaomi, for example, is planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, focusing on developed markets, with a goal of 10,000 overseas stores in the next five years. The company previously closed its stores in France in 2022 to adjust its retail strategy to better align with consumer purchasing behavior. This expansion reflects a broader trend of Chinese brands aiming to enhance their image and market share in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported a 500% increase in assaults against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during recent enforcement operations. Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that an ICE officer was recently dragged 50 yards by a car while arresting an illegal alien sex offender. DHS also reported incidents where Border Patrol vehicles were violently targeted during lawful operations in California, including ramming and tire slashing. McLaughlin blamed Democratic politicians for contributing to the surge in assaults through their vilification and demonization of ICE agents, and emphasized that those who attack ICE agents will be prosecuted.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has voted in favor of a bill that would allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social shift. The bill now moves to the House of Lords, where it is expected to face considerable debate and potential amendments. The government anticipates a longer "commencement period" to prepare for the implementation of the law. While opinion polls show significant public support for the change, some opponents raised concerns about the practicalities of the bill, suggesting it be called "assisted suicide" or "assisted killing".</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector, already facing a prolonged downturn, is further challenged by a shrinking population, which is reducing demand for new homes. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed, at a quarter of the 2017 peak. The country's declining fertility rate, despite Beijing's efforts to incentivize child-bearing, contributes to this demographic shift. Stagnant incomes, job instability, and a weak social security system have discouraged young people from having more children, limiting the effectiveness of pronatalist policies.</p>

          <p>The head of China’s United Front Work Department, Li Ganjie, has warned religious organizations to guard against “hidden dangers in the religious field and resolutely resist foreign infiltration.” This warning follows similar calls by senior figures, including President Xi Jinping, to promote the “Sinicisation of religion.” The increased scrutiny comes ahead of the Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday, reflecting concerns about external influences on religious practices within China. The government aims to maintain control over religious groups and prevent any perceived threats to national unity.</p>

Despite not feeling his sharpest, Kershaw battled through five innings, allowing two solo home runs but securing the win. Miguel Rojas contributed with a two-run home run, and closer Tanner Scott earned his 15th save of the season, securing the Dodgers' win.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu has long advocated for action against Iran, which he views as a grave threat to Israel. Recent attacks by Israel on Iran's nuclear plants have been met with broad support within Israel, even as they have triggered retaliatory missile strikes. While Netanyahu's leadership has been criticized for failing to prevent past security crises, attacking Iran is a more consensual issue, with a majority of Israelis supporting the decision. However, critics question whether Netanyahu's actions are politically motivated and whether the conflict will truly rid Israel of Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

Bringing out the band’s frontman Jay Kay for a one-off performance of his 1996 hit Virtual Insanity, the star said he was “a massive trailblazer for British music". Their performance came half-way through a stunning two-hour show, that saw Lipa tear through hits like Physical, One Kiss, New Rules and Levitating. Some dedicated fans had camped out since Thursday to see the singer’s UK stadium debut, braving temperatures that exceeded 31C.</p>
