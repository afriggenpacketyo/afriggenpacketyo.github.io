          <h2>Exploring the Rising Rates of Autism Diagnoses: A Comprehensive Analysis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:19:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the exponential increase in autism diagnoses over the past two decades, particularly in Anglophone and European countries. It highlights that the rise in diagnoses does not necessarily equate to an increase in the number of autistic individuals, but rather reflects changes in diagnostic criteria, including the addition of Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS to the autism spectrum. The article further explores the increasing recognition of autism in women and adults, who were historically underdiagnosed, and addresses concerns about the potential for glamorizing autism while overlooking the needs of those with higher support requirements. The piece emphasizes the importance of understanding the diversity within the autistic community and addressing the challenges faced by those who spent much of their lives undiagnosed and unsupported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article summarizes the ongoing trial of two men accused of felling the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, a landmark on Hadrian's Wall. The prosecution alleges that the defendants, Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, carried out a "moronic mission," with one felling the tree and the other filming it. Key evidence includes a video found on Graham's phone, cell site analysis tracking their movements, and a wedge of wood identified as coming from the tree found in Graham's car. Graham has testified that Carruthers felled the tree without his knowledge, while Carruthers denies ever felling a tree. The article highlights the international outrage sparked by the felling and the unraveling of the defendants' friendship as the public revulsion became clear.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article reports on allegations that Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, has been exerting influence on his career decisions. The article claims Hudson "forced her way" into a Dunkin' Super Bowl commercial and played a role in HBO's "Hard Knocks" no longer featuring North Carolina's football team after Belichick became the head coach. Hudson allegedly demanded to be an executive producer on the program and asked for "dailies of the proposed show," while saying executives needed to "treat her with respect or they wouldnâ€™t get to use the coachâ€™s â€˜IP.â€™" The article suggests their relationship has been under increased scrutiny due to Belichickâ€™s arrival on social media.</p>

          <p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has laid off most of its remaining staff, significantly impacting worker safety programs.

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day from its Newark Liberty International Airport schedule after experiencing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the disruptions to air traffic controller staffing shortages and the Federal Aviation Administration's technology problems. The flight cuts, amounting to about 10% of United's daily schedule at Newark, will begin this weekend. Kirby is urging the FAA to more tightly control capacity at the airport by establishing flight restrictions.</p>
