          <p>President Trump and President Xi Jinping had a productive 90-minute discussion, leading to an agreement for U.S. and Chinese officials to meet soon to address the ongoing trade war. Trump noted the call resulted in a positive outcome for both countries and that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. in these renewed discussions. The leaders did not discuss issues related to Russia, Ukraine, or Iran, but Trump mentioned Xi invited him and his wife to visit China, an invitation he reciprocated. The trade relationship between the two nations, valued at nearly $600 billion in 2024, has been strained due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a roughly 4% decrease on Thursday as CEO Elon Musk intensified his opposition to President Trump's spending bill. Musk has publicly criticized the bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" and threatening primary challenges for lawmakers who support it, which marks a notable shift in his stance towards the administration. The stock decline follows a 22% rally in May, despite weak sales figures, with Musk having recently concluded his role as head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Activists reported that those detained were asked to attend routine appointments regarding their immigration status, only to be taken into custody.

The defense also cast doubt on Bongolan's claim that Combs held her over a balcony at Ventura's apartment, questioning whether Ventura actually witnessed the incident. Prosecutors contend the alleged balcony incident demonstrates Combs' coercion of Ventura, while the defense challenged Bongolan's claim that Combs sexually assaulted her.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously blocked a lawsuit filed by the Mexican government against major U.S. gun manufacturers, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields the firearms industry from civil suits. Mexico argued that gun manufacturers knowingly aided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to straw purchasers, who then trafficked them to drug cartels. The court, however, found that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted retail dealers' unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the "background circumstances" requirement cannot be reconciled with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

          <p>The Supreme Court has sided with a Catholic charity that was denied a tax exemption, reversing a decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The Wisconsin court had previously determined that the charity's activities in serving the state's poor were not sufficiently religious to qualify for the exemption. The Supreme Court's decision underscores the importance of religious freedom and the ability of religious organizations to operate without undue government interference. This ruling is expected to have significant implications for similar cases involving religious charities and tax exemptions.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo faced criticism from fellow Democrats during a mayoral debate for allegedly lying to Congress about his role in drafting a report that undercounted COVID-19 nursing home deaths. Cuomo dismissed the allegations as partisan politics, insisting the report "did not undercount the deaths." Opponents accused him of perjury and prioritizing a book deal over the well-being of grieving families. The Department of Justice is investigating whether Cuomo lied to Congress about his COVID-19 decisions, including a directive that initially barred nursing homes from refusing patients who had tested positive.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling back price checks used to calculate the inflation rate due to staffing shortages, potentially leading to less accurate cost-of-living reports. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has suspended data gathering in Lincoln, Neb., and Provo, Utah, and halted it in Buffalo, N.Y. The cutbacks come amid a federal government hiring freeze and overall workforce reductions. Economists warn that these reductions could cause more volatility in regional cost-of-living reports and price information on particular items, especially as concerns about tariffs rekindling inflation persist.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging in recent months, investors should consider key questions before investing. It's important to assess whether to wait for a potential price drop, though waiting too long carries risks due to gold's general upward trend.

Investors should also determine a safe investment amount, typically up to 10% of their overall portfolio, adjusting for the current elevated price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein believed that language is inherently limited in conveying subtle truths and subjective experiences, suggesting that words are merely a crude model of the world. Misunderstanding, common in human communication, reduces well-being, and Wittgenstein's philosophy implies that we will never fully comprehend the meaning of our lives through language alone. To transcend these limitations, it is recommended to engage in meditative contemplation, focusing on a single concept to inspire insight. This practice encourages seeking understanding rather than precise answers, recognizing that complex experiences often defy verbal expression.</p>
