          <p>President Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, declined to definitively commit to Article 5, the principle of collective defense among NATO members. Trump stated that his commitment "depends on your definition" and that there are "numerous definitions of Article 5." He later added that he is committed to being friends with the leaders and helping them but would provide a precise definition of his commitment later. The ambiguity raised concerns among NATO nations regarding the U.S.'s dedication to mutual defense. </p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the Fed's commitment to preventing an "ongoing inflation problem," noting that policymakers will remain cautious until the impact of tariffs on prices is clearer. Powell characterized economic growth as strong with the labor market near full employment, but acknowledged that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. His cautious stance contrasts with President Trump's criticism, who expressed frustration with Powell's policies. Powell is scheduled to present his comments to congressional committees this week.

Krispy Kreme will now focus on expansion through high-volume retail points and international franchise growth, and the companies noted that the agreement was a small part of McDonald's business.

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that world leaders should stop trying to decipher President Trump's behavior, comparing it to overanalyzing the actions of a disinterested romantic partner. The author argues that Trump's actions are primarily self-serving and that attempting to find deeper meaning or positive intent is a waste of time. The piece encourages leaders to recognize that Trump is not interested in reciprocal relationships and to act accordingly.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Russia only understands the language of force and that the NATO summit aims to secure peace in Europe. Germany has pledged to meet the 5% of GDP defense spending target, with a budget deal to reach the goal by 2029. Merz emphasized that this commitment is not a favor to the U.S. but a response to Russia's threat to European security. The NATO summit is expected to approve a major new investment plan to raise the benchmark for defense investment.</p>

          <p>India's aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has found multiple instances of aircraft defects reappearing at Mumbai and Delhi airports, indicating inadequate checks on jetliners. The findings were part of a special audit to strengthen safety after a deadly Air India crash earlier this month. The DGCA also found other violations, such as an aircraft maintenance engineer not taking prescribed safety precautions. The regulator has communicated the findings to the concerned operators, giving them seven days to take corrective measures.</p>
