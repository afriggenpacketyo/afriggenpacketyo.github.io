          <p>Residents in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, are suing Sunoco Pipeline after a jet fuel leak from the Twin Oaks pipeline contaminated their drinking water wells. Kristine Wojnovich and other neighbors noticed an oily taste and smell in their water in 2023, but Sunoco initially claimed no contamination was present. Sixteen months later, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection discovered the leak, impacting at least 38 wells. Wojnovich found 15 gallons of jet fuel in her well and Sunoco continues to skim fuel daily. The article reports that Sunoco spilled more fuel than any other pipeline company in the U.S. in 2024. </p>

          <p>This article recounts the history of the Great Wall Film Company, one of the first Chinese American film studios in the U.S., founded in Brooklyn in the 1920s. Frustrated by the one-dimensional and demeaning portrayals of Chinese people in early Hollywood films, Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do established the studio to create more authentic representations. The studio, which later moved to Shanghai, produced around two dozen films before closing during the Great Depression. The Lee family's legacy continued with the New York Chinese Film Exchange, highlighting their lasting impact on the world of cinema.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The brothers were convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and claimed self-defense due to alleged abuse. The resentencing decision was praised by their attorney, Mark Geragos, who called it a step towards bringing the brothers home. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings and then to the governor's office for final approval.</p>

          <p>An interim report reveals that the superyacht Bayesian, which sank off the coast of Sicily and killed tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, was capsized by "extreme wind." The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch found that winds exceeding 80mph caused the yacht to tilt violently, leading to rapid flooding. The report indicated that the yacht was vulnerable to lighter winds and that the crew was unaware of this instability. The investigation is ongoing, with efforts to raise the vessel from the seabed temporarily halted after a diver died.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Missouri have approved a new referendum to repeal an abortion-rights amendment that voters approved last year. The proposed constitutional amendment would ban most abortions, with exceptions for rape and incest, and would also prohibit gender transition surgeries for minors. The measure passed the Republican-led House and Senate and will go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner if the governor calls a special election.
