          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced a significant challenge after Israel reported Hamas violations, leading to air and artillery strikes that killed two IDF soldiers. The Israeli military accused Hamas of targeting its forces with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire, prompting Prime Minister Netanyahu to order strong action. Aid transfers into Gaza were initially halted, and later resumed for Monday, though the Rafah border crossing remains closed pending the return of deceased hostages. Hamas denied involvement in the reported clashes and reaffirmed its commitment to the truce, while internal clashes among Palestinian groups have further complicated the security situation in the territory.</p>

          <p>A former FBI art crime expert commented on the "brazen" Louvre Museum heist, suggesting the stolen French crown jewels, including Empress Eugénie's diadem, might be melted down or pieced out. Tim Carpenter noted the operation was a targeted heist, indicating the thieves knew the immense cultural and historical value of the items. The daytime robbery, which occurred in under seven minutes, saw two thieves disguised as construction workers use a lift and angle grinder to breach a window. Police are investigating the theft of eight objects, with authorities emphasizing their inestimable heritage value and a race against time to recover them before they are dismantled.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher on Monday, anticipating upcoming economic data from China, which kept its benchmark one-year loan prime rate steady at 3%. This decision aligned with market expectations and contributed to a positive sentiment across the region. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix both saw gains, as did South Korea's Kospi, which extended its record-high streak. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index futures also indicated a higher open, reflecting a broader regional uplift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bereaved families are advocating for a public inquiry into the UK government's alleged "repeated failures" to address warnings about a website promoting suicide. A report by the Molly Rose Foundation claims departments received 65 warnings about the forum and similar sites, which have been linked to at least 133 UK deaths from a toxic chemical. Families have written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, highlighting concerns about online grooming and the government's fragmented response. The Online Safety Act now grants Ofcom powers to act against sites hosting illegal content, though the criticized forum is currently geo-blocked for UK users by its own decision.</p>

          <p>Erez Reuveni, a former Department of Justice lawyer, claims he was fired after refusing to sign a brief in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia mistaken deportation case, alleging he witnessed a disregard for due process and the rule of law. Reuveni states he was ordered to argue that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member and terrorist to prevent his return, despite it being factually and legally incorrect. He also recounts a superior suggesting they might disregard federal court orders regarding mass deportations of Venezuelans. Reuveni's whistleblower disclosure, supported by analysis from NYU law professor Ryan Goodman, highlights a pattern of judges criticizing the Justice Department for providing false information in hundreds of cases.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, according to preliminary results, ending two decades of leftist rule. The election occurred amidst Bolivia's worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a US dollar shortage, 23% inflation, and a devalued currency. Paz and his rival, Jorge Quiroga, both campaigned on promises to stabilize the economy, restructure state-owned businesses, and attract foreign investment, while aiming to maintain social welfare programs. Paz's victory signals a significant shift in Bolivia's alliances, moving away from China and Russia towards stronger relations with the United States.</p>

Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu highlights significant cost reductions and performance improvements in LiDAR technology.

This discovery follows an attempted assassination against the president last year at his nearby golf club.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its seventh known strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel, resulting in three fatalities, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced. The strike targeted a boat linked to the Ejército de Liberación Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group, in international waters within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility. Hegseth stated the U.S. considers these organizations terrorists and will "hunt and kill" them, asserting that drug smuggling constitutes an "armed attack" on Americans. The administration's actions have faced pushback from lawmakers questioning the legal justification and constitutionality of these strikes, which have now resulted in at least 32 deaths.</p>

          <p>A Tesla Cybertruck owner faced a disappointing outcome when attempting to sell his practically new vehicle with only 800 miles, as it failed to recoup even 70% of its initial $102,000 price at auction. The highest bid of $69,420 highlights the significant depreciation experienced by the controversial electric vehicle. This incident reflects Tesla's broader struggles, including a sales slump, fluctuating stocks, and numerous recalls for the Cybertruck within a year and a half. Such lackluster resale values could make potential buyers wary of adopting eco-friendly vehicles, despite the increasing number of EV options available from various automakers.

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner disclosed two critical turning points in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiations: an apology call from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and a moment of human connection. Netanyahu's apology to Qatar, facilitated by President Trump, was deemed essential for moving talks forward after Israeli airstrikes. A personal exchange between Witkoff and Hamas's top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, who both had lost sons, transformed the negotiation dynamic. Trump's guarantee of U.S. backing for the deal, ensuring fair treatment and non-violation, ultimately helped secure the agreement, leading to a moment of shared relief and hugs between Israeli and Qatari negotiators.</p>

Dozens of smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices were thrown, resulting in injuries to twelve civilians and three officers, with nine arrests made. Hapoel Tel Aviv criticized the police's decision, accusing them of "preparing for a war, not a sporting event." This unrest follows recent safety concerns, including a ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans attending an upcoming Europa League match in England, amidst broader protests related to the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>China's forthcoming Five Year Plan, to be decided this week, builds on a history of strategic planning that has profoundly reshaped the global economy. Past plans, like Deng Xiaoping's "Reform and Opening Up" in 1981, transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse, leading to the "China shock" and the outsourcing of millions of Western jobs. The 2011-15 plan focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, giving China a near monopoly on rare earth supply chains and global leadership in EVs and renewables. More recently, "high quality development" aims for technological self-reliance, challenging American dominance and sparking international diplomatic rows over Chinese tech.</p>

          <p>Metal shrapnel struck a California Highway Patrol (CHP) vehicle and motorcycle during a U.S. military live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton, which launched artillery rounds over Interstate 5. The incident occurred shortly after Vice President JD Vance's protective detail had been escorted to the Marine Corps event, with the shrapnel originating from an ordnance that "detonated overhead prematurely." No injuries were reported, but the shrapnel left a small dent on the patrol vehicle's hood. The exercise, part of the Marine Corps’ 250th-anniversary celebration, was subsequently terminated, and Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as "reckless" due to the safety risks posed to the public and the resulting traffic disruptions.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new V-level vocational courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the post-GCSE qualifications landscape and replace Level 3 BTecs. This initiative is part of a broader white paper on post-16 education and skills, with ministers also proposing an alternative qualification to reduce GCSE maths and English resits. Skills minister Baroness Jacqui Smith emphasized that V-levels will build on the practical, employment-focused aspects of existing qualifications, allowing students to combine them with A-levels or T-levels. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association warns of potential gaps, the goal is to provide clearer pathways and support vocational training.</p>

This accusation comes as President Trump's administration implements tough tariffs, with the US economy seemingly insulated by a tech wealth boom, raising concerns about an AI bubble.

It highlights two distinguishing factors from past hegemonic transitions: nuclear weapons rendering total war irrational, and technological interdependence creating prohibitive costs for systemic rupture. The article argues that global supply chains and financial ties create strong domestic interests in avoiding war between major powers. It suggests that while conflict may manifest as proxy wars and economic confrontation, direct great power clashes are strategically suicidal, necessitating patient statecraft.</p>
