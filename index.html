          <p>A bomb exploded near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, killing one and injuring at least four. The FBI has classified the incident as an intentional act of terrorism and is investigating whether it was a domestic or international terror event.

The clinic confirmed that its staff and reproductive materials were unharmed and expects to resume normal operations soon. The FBI is currently investigating a person of interest but has stated they are not actively searching for a suspect.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on increased prices, suggesting the company should absorb the costs instead. Walmart had warned of potential price hikes on various products due to tariffs, despite recent reductions. Trump argued that Walmart, having made billions, should sacrifice profits to support his economic agenda, which he claims will create more domestic manufacturing jobs. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company would strive to maintain low prices despite retail margin challenges. This confrontation highlights the tension between Trump's trade policies and major American corporations.</p>

          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent engaged with hackers claiming responsibility for cyber attacks on M&S and Co-op, who provided evidence of stolen customer and employee data. The hackers, linked to a cyber crime service called DragonForce, expressed frustration over Co-op's refusal to meet their ransom demands. DragonForce, a ransomware-as-a-service provider, offers cyber criminal affiliates tools for extortion in exchange for a cut of the ransoms. The group's darknet website was recently hacked by a rival gang, highlighting the ongoing power struggle within the cyber crime ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove stated that another Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is overwhelming public support. Gove, who oversaw relations between the UK and Scottish governments, cautioned against complacency among union supporters, emphasizing the need to demonstrate the union's effectiveness. First Minister John Swinney also echoed a similar sentiment, focusing on securing demonstrable support for independence, akin to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament. Gove highlighted the importance of improving public services to bolster confidence in the SNP's governance.</p>

A Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, with a hearing scheduled for next month. Their fate rests with the Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who must consider the changing public opinion.</p>

          <p>The FDA approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but limited its use to older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions. This decision restricts access for healthy individuals under 65 and mandates further studies on potential heart-related side effects, which could cost Novavax millions. Experts have expressed disappointment, suggesting the restrictions reflect skepticism towards vaccines from health agency leaders. The approval requires Novavax to conduct extensive research, raising concerns about the economic viability of the vaccine, especially given the availability of mRNA vaccines.</p>

          <p>A local government in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, is facing backlash for promoting a bridge as an ideal spot for Mt. Fuji photos, leading to overtourism and disruptions for residents. The "Mt. Fuji dream bridge" attracts many visitors seeking Instagrammable shots, resulting in illegal parking, excessive noise, and trespassing. Despite efforts to manage the influx with multilingual signs and free parking, local residents complain about the disturbances. A tourism professor criticized the city's response as insufficient, urging prioritization of residents' well-being and restraint from tourists.</p>
