          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, world leaders and organizations have expressed varied reactions. Israeli leaders lauded the strikes, while Iranian officials vowed retaliation and condemned the action as a violation of the UN Charter. Russian state media criticized the strikes as irresponsible, and the UN Secretary General urged de-escalation and diplomacy. Iran's allies, including Hamas and the Houthis, also condemned the strikes and pledged to join in retaliation, raising concerns about a wider regional conflict. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the international response to the escalating tensions in the Middle East. The situation remains volatile as countries grapple with the implications of the U.S. military action. </p>

          <p>The article analyzes President Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, characterizing it as a high-stakes gamble with significant geopolitical implications. Success could disempower Iran and enhance Trump's authority, while failure could lead to a broader conflict and international condemnation. European leaders are privately hoping for the latter, fearing Trump's methods breach international law and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. China and Russia are wary of a unipolar world, with Russia offering Iran assistance in developing nuclear capabilities. The analysis explores potential outcomes, including Iran's retaliation, abandonment of the non-proliferation treaty, and the possibility of a longer, more complex conflict. </p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed reservations about the U.S. strikes against Iran, calling them a "massive gamble" by President Trump.

He highlighted the lack of congressional approval for the strikes, asserting that Congress holds the sole authority to declare war. Himes's comments reflect concerns about the potential consequences of the strikes and the importance of congressional oversight in military actions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil trade route. This appeal comes after Iran warned it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Closing the strait could severely impact the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel. While analysts view the risk as low due to potential U.S. intervention, disruptions could last weeks or months. Rubio asserted that closing the strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran, given its reliance on the waterway for oil exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. is "not at war" with Iran but with its nuclear weapons program, as the Iranian regime considers a response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear installations. While declining to confirm the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear sites, Vance stated the U.S. has "substantially delayed" Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon. This comes as an Iranian member of parliament claimed the Fordo enrichment plant was not seriously damaged, and satellite images showed possible damage but no conclusive evidence of a breach. Nuclear analysts are divided on whether the strikes will lead to negotiations or further uranium enrichment by Iran.</p>

Rubio emphasized the U.S. has no plans for further attacks unless provoked and urged Iran to pursue diplomacy. He said the strikes aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, not to attack the Iranian people or seek regime change. Rubio also addressed concerns about potential Iranian retaliation, reiterating that the U.S. will defend its interests and allies in the region.

          <p>This article investigates a rumor circulating online claiming that Iranian state TV announced a "great surprise" that the world would remember for centuries. The rumor gained traction on social media, with several news outlets reporting it as fact. However, searches of major wire services found no evidence to support the claim, and the original post on X was deleted. The rumor likely originated from an X account called Tehran Updates, which is not affiliated with any government entity. While the truth about the matter remains unconfirmed, the lack of credible evidence suggests the rumor is likely false.</p>

          <p>President Trump had already approved a plan for the U.S. to attack an Iranian nuclear facility before a scheduled lunch with Steve Bannon, according to sources. Bannon, who had spoken with Trump earlier, intended to dissuade him from the strike, citing concerns about Israeli intelligence, the effectiveness of the bunker-buster bomb, and the risk to U.S. troops. However, a White House official stated that Trump had already decided to hold off on the strike before the meeting. This article highlights internal discussions and decision-making processes within the Trump administration regarding military action against Iran.</p>

Cities are opening cooling centers and issuing heat emergencies to protect residents. The heat is causing disruptions to outdoor activities and sporting events, with athletes experiencing heat-related illnesses.

          <p>Satellite images appear to contradict the Trump administration's claims that U.S. strikes completely destroyed Iranian nuclear sites. While the images show new craters and potential damage at Fordo and Natanz, a large support building at Fordo remained undamaged. The IAEA has not been able to verify the location of Iran's near-bomb-grade uranium. Analysts suggest the strikes may complicate tracking uranium and incentivize Iran to move its program underground. Darya Dolzikova of the Royal United Services Institute suggests the strikes might convince Iran that transparency doesn't work. The IAEA has called for a cessation of hostilities to address the situation.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers across the political spectrum have responded to President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities with mixed reactions. Republicans such as Senators Graham and Cruz largely supported the action, while Democrats, including House Leader Jeffries and Senator Schumer, criticized the lack of congressional consultation. Some Democrats, like Representatives Massie and Khanna, argued the strikes were unconstitutional and called for Congress to assert its war powers. Senator Sanders condemned the strikes as unconstitutional and was met with "no more war" chants. The responses highlight the ongoing debate over presidential authority and the potential for escalating conflict with Iran.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday, showing resilience after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by optimism that Washington's involvement would lead to a resolution. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major gainer, closing significantly higher. Analysts suggest the Gulf's call for appeasement and condemnation of Israeli aggression has helped isolate it from the conflict.

          <p>The United States has escalated the Israel-Iran war by bombing key Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, marking a critical turning point in the Middle East. The attacks targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the Pentagon confirming the use of "bunker-busting" warheads. While the extent of the damage is still being assessed, concerns have arisen regarding potential radiation leaks and the movement of enriched uranium to undisclosed locations. The international community is responding with mixed reactions, with regional governments expressing concern and traditional US allies urging a diplomatic solution. The US has warned Iran against retaliation, while Iran has vowed "everlasting consequences" for the US and declared its nuclear program would continue.</p>

          <p>Following a shooting at Crosspointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, where a gunman was killed by a security guard after wounding one person, the community is grappling with the aftermath. The church's pastor, Bobby Kelly Jr., recounted how a church member ran over the shooter with a truck, creating an opportunity for the security guard to act. The church had established a security team a decade ago in response to violence at other places of worship, although they had not received any specific threats. The pastor told the Detroit News that the children in attendance were "doing good" after the attack and that congregants were supporting each other. He added that his church would “put a formal plan in place for the aftermath” of Sunday.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, is navigating a delicate diplomatic situation regarding Iran after recent US airstrikes. Starmer's calls for de-escalation were not heeded by the White House, but he has maintained a relationship with President Trump. The UK was given advanced warning of the US action but was not asked to participate, possibly due to legal debates within the government. The UK's position is that while they didn't endorse the means, they support the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons development. The US may request military support from the UK in the future, posing further challenges for Starmer.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have revealed details about "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran. The operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, with other B-2s acting as decoys. The bombers dropped 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on targets at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk cruise missiles targeted the site in Isfahan. The Pentagon claims the strikes inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" and warned Iran against retaliation. The operation involved over 125 U.S. aircraft and utilized over 75 precision-guided weapons, with no shots fired at the U.S. strike package.</p>

Phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the article suggests alternative phrases that promote respect, emotional safety, and problem-solving.

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure endorsing the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil and gas route, following U.S. airstrikes in Iran. While the decision ultimately rests with Iran's Supreme National Security Council, the move could have significant implications for global oil supplies and fuel costs. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned against closing the strait, calling it an escalation of conflict and a "suicidal move" for Iran. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz raises concerns about further instability in the region and its impact on the global economy. The U.S. is on high alert for retaliation from Tehran.</p>
