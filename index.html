          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was erroneously deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, alleges he endured brutal beatings and psychological torture in the notorious CECOT mega-prison. According to a court filing, he suffered severe mistreatment, including sleep deprivation and malnourishment, causing his health to rapidly deteriorate. Garcia was returned to the U.S. following a Supreme Court order but was immediately detained on separate federal charges. His lawyers are using the testimony of his abuse to argue against any future deportation, while the Department of Homeland Security maintains he has gang affiliations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he is scheduled to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday morning, a development that follows recent shifts in U.S. foreign policy. The call comes shortly after the White House confirmed a halt on some weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision reportedly made due to concerns over dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. This conversation precedes a planned call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.

          <p>President Trump has achieved his first major legislative win of his second term with Congress passing a sprawling spending package. The bill allocates approximately $150 billion for border security and another $150 billion for military expenditures, including a missile defense program. However, its most significant feature is over $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over ten years, which critics warn will add more than $3 trillion to the national debt. The legislation also includes controversial cuts of about $1 trillion to Medicaid, prompting criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who argue it betrays promises to protect healthcare for low-income Americans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued strength in June by adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' expectations and keeping pace with the average monthly gain over the last year. This performance lowered the national unemployment rate to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. The growth was primarily led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw a reduction. Despite this resilience, economists anticipate a potential slowdown, with the Federal Reserve holding off on interest rate cuts due to tariff-related inflation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision comes at a critical time, with Russia intensifying its attacks and Ukraine's domestic defense production not yet sufficient to meet its needs. European allies have been increasing their support, but a long-term reduction in U.S. aid would significantly challenge Ukraine's defense capabilities, particularly in air defense and long-range systems.

The game was paused as players from both teams and the sold-out stadium gave him a standing ovation. Kershaw is now one of only four left-handed pitchers in the elite 3,000-strikeout club, joining Randy Johnson, Steve Carlton, and CC Sabathia.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed legislative package significantly reshapes U.S. energy policy, prioritizing fossil fuels while terminating key federal support for the solar and wind industries. The law mandates new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands and waters, slashes royalty rates for producers, and incentivizes carbon capture for enhanced oil recovery. Conversely, it phases out long-standing investment and production tax credits for solar and wind power for projects starting after 2027. Renewable energy industry groups have warned that this move undermines America's manufacturing and energy leadership, potentially leading to factory closures and reduced investment.</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" explores the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film is critiqued for emphasizing his global brand over his culinary genius. Directed by Matt Tyrnauer, the documentary chronicles Matsuhisa's journey from humble beginnings and early failures to establishing a high-end restaurant empire with co-founder Robert De Niro. While featuring celebrity patrons like Cindy Crawford and highlighting the brand's exclusivity, the film is said to lack a deep exploration of Matsuhisa's innovative techniques.

Ye has been a frequent visitor to Australia, as his wife, Bianca Censori, is from Melbourne.

The legislation makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts and includes breaks for business owners and large estates.

This pattern is attributed to the public's tendency to react against what is perceived as ideological overreach and the negative media attention that focuses on partisan conflict. As the public learns more about the bill's details, such as its $3 trillion addition to the debt and cuts to Medicaid, its unpopularity is likely to grow, potentially harming Republicans in future elections.</p>

          <p>The second season of John Leguizamo's docuseries, "Leguizamo Does America," premieres on MSNBC, exploring Latino communities in cities like Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Denver. The new season arrives in a changed political climate under the Trump administration, with increased threats of deportations impacting the communities featured. Leguizamo and director Ben DeJesus aim to highlight the contributions and resilience of Latinos as an "antidote" to what they describe as cruel and inhumane treatment. The series continues Leguizamo's long-standing effort to increase Latino representation and visibility in media, framing their success as a form of resistance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill" enacts a sweeping realignment of federal policy, primarily by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new deductions for tips and overtime. To partially fund these cuts, the legislation slashes social programs, including an estimated 18% cut to Medicaid and 20% to food stamps, which could leave millions without coverage. The bill also redirects funds from clean energy initiatives, repealing many Biden-era incentives, to boost spending on military and immigration enforcement, including the border wall. Critics note the package is projected to add at least $3 trillion to the national debt.</p>

          <p>This article outlines five key signs that an individual's credit card debt may be too substantial to manage with a do-it-yourself payoff plan. These indicators include consistently failing to pay more than the minimum, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit cards for essential living expenses. Other warning signs are a debt-to-income ratio exceeding 40% and being unable to qualify for reasonable debt consolidation loans. When these situations arise, it is often necessary to seek professional help through options like credit counseling, debt settlement programs, or, in extreme cases, bankruptcy.

The case originated from a BBC report about a neo-Nazi agent who abused his former partner. The court found that evidence from MI5's third-in-command was neither fair nor accurate, and the new investigation will be overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner.</p>

          <p>Despite internal opposition and widespread public disapproval, Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate passed President Trump's massive legislative package. The bill, which makes tax cuts permanent and slashes social safety nets, demonstrates Trump's firm control over the party, as members set aside prior pledges to avoid deep Medicaid cuts or increasing the national debt. Senator Thom Tillis, a retiring Republican, was a notable critic, accusing the White House of breaking promises. The passage reflects a political calculation that enacting the president's agenda, however unpopular, is preferable to legislative inaction.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's legislative bill is set to cause significant upheaval in the American healthcare system. The legislation's changes to Medicaid, including new work requirements and financing restrictions, are projected by the Congressional Budget Office to leave nearly 12 million people uninsured and slash program spending by over $1 trillion. Combined with other policy changes, up to 17 million Americans could lose coverage over the next decade. This will likely increase costs for everyone, as hospitals pass on the expense of uncompensated care, making Republicans politically accountable for the system's subsequent problems.</p>
