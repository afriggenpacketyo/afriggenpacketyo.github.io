          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 17:02:13 EDT</div>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized judges accused of helping undocumented immigrants evade arrest, asserting that "no one is above the law." The remarks followed the arrests of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan and former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano, both accused of assisting immigrants. Dugan allegedly misdirected federal agents during an immigration arrest operation, while Cano is accused of harboring a Venezuelan national with gang ties. The arrests have sparked controversy, with critics accusing the Trump administration of intimidating judges who oppose its immigration policies; Bondi dismissed these concerns, emphasizing the government's commitment to protecting citizens and enforcing the law.</p>

          <p>ICE Denver announced the arrest of Joel Matos-Nieto, a Venezuelan national and alleged member of the Tren de Aragua gang, who had a final deportation order. Matos-Nieto has prior convictions for motor vehicle theft, obstructing a police officer, and criminal mischief. This arrest follows President Trump's crackdown on gang crime, which included labeling Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization, leading to over 600 arrests. The announcement comes after the arrest of a former New Mexico judge and his wife for allegedly harboring a suspected TdA gang member, highlighting the administration's focus on combating gang-related immigration issues.</p>

Despite a recent relief rally driven by hopes of de-escalation in the trade war, analysts caution that the market remains headline-driven and prone to volatility until there is more clarity on trade policies.
