          <h2>Federal Courts Increasingly Used for Venue Shopping to Obtain Nationwide Injunctions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, strategically filing lawsuits in federal jurisdictions where they anticipate sympathetic judges. Conservatives often target small Texas courts with single judges appointed by Republicans, ensuring initial rulings align with their views. Similarly, during the Trump administration, liberals favored larger venues within the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to issue nationwide injunctions, potentially impacting the implementation of presidential policies across the country, as the practice erodes public confidence in the impartiality of the courts.</p>

          <p>In the Sean Combs trial, Cassie Ventura faced a rigorous cross-examination where defense attorneys presented years of text messages to challenge her credibility. The defense aimed to portray Ventura as a willing participant in Combs' lifestyle, including drug-fueled orgies, suggesting she was not a victim of sexual assault. Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs but testified that his personality changed over time, becoming violent and jealous. The defense highlighted messages showing Ventura's apparent eagerness to engage in 'freak-offs' and her attempts to please Combs, while also suggesting mutual jealousy defined their relationship. This article contains the words 'sexual assault' in lieu of 'rape' as requested.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to falling exports. The GDP data was worse than economists' expectations, with exports dropping by 0.6% due to uncertainties from U.S. trade policies. Despite this, domestic demand showed a bright spot with a 0.6% increase, and economists anticipate a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. that could mitigate tariff impacts. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain current rates, potentially hiking later in the year if inflation targets are met, but remains wary of downside risks from global trade policies.</p>

The acting administrator stated the agency aims to safeguard Americans, prioritize state responses, and coordinate federal assistance as needed. Morale at FEMA has reportedly declined since the announcement of potential agency elimination, and the acting administrator has urged staff to support the president's objectives.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing the world's fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million cases by 2050. A study published in PLOS One indicates that dementia cases in China have risen from approximately 4 million in 1990 to 17 million in 2021. Researchers used data from the Global Burden of Disease database to analyze dementia incidence and risk factors in individuals aged 40 and over. While the study does not specify a cause, it notes that the country's rapidly aging population is likely contributing to the problem, potentially compounding existing challenges.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is threatened by migrating humpback whales, leading to entanglements in fishing ropes. To mitigate this, some fishermen are using high-tech systems involving remote-controlled pop-up devices to retrieve crab cages, reducing rope usage. While effective, the technology faces resistance due to cost and tradition, as it adds $50 per cage. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect whales, but fishermen using the experimental devices can continue fishing. The technology is an experiment sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>

          <p>Ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, facilitated by a land bridge connecting the two continents. The study, published in Science, examined fossils including Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, revealing mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. Researchers found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions. These migrations occurred during the last glacial interval.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court justices are divided on Donald Trump’s attempt to sidestep the constitution to limit birthright citizenship. The cases before the court stem from the president’s January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren’t citizens or permanent residents. The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States”. The administration is asking for the scope of the injunctions to be narrowed, so they only apply to the people, organizations or states that sued.</p>

          <p>In rural Japan, severe depopulation has led to the transformation of unstaffed train stations and vacant homes into tourist accommodations, injecting new life into surrounding areas. Transport operators are collaborating with local communities to repurpose these quiet outposts into hubs of activity. This creative approach is proving successful in revitalizing rural areas and attracting tourists. The efforts aim to counteract the effects of depopulation and create sustainable communities.</p>

The retailer said that President Trump's tariffs are impeding its ability to maintain low prices for consumers.

Rising cost pressures, stemming from tariffs, began in late April and accelerated in May, impacting various categories such as electronics and toys.</p>

          <p>New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting access to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products,' requiring additional clinical evaluation. The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax for its COVID vaccine. Some experts fear the new federal limits could undermine the use of all vaccines, while others question the necessity of annual COVID shots for younger, healthy individuals.</p>

          <p>An audit of deaths in Maryland found that medical examiners miscategorized dozens of deaths that happened in police custody, often classifying them as natural or accidental. At least 36 of those deaths should have been called homicides, with evidence of racism and pro-police bias influencing the decisions. The audit was prompted in part by the police killing of George Floyd, leading to scrutiny of Dr. David R. Fowler's tenure as chief medical examiner. The report suggests a systemic issue rather than individual conduct, prompting a review of cases to assess the need for additional investigations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took Treasury Department officials by surprise.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision had been discussed and considered for weeks. The Syrian transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, citing its inability to pay salaries and rebuild infrastructure. Some of the most punitive measures were imposed on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for terrorist organizations.</p>

The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces.
