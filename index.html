          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced at the GTC Paris developer conference that quantum computing is approaching a point where it can solve real-world problems. Quantum computers utilize qubits, which can represent zero, one, or a superposition of both, enabling them to process much larger data volumes than classical computers. This breakthrough has spurred investor interest, as seen in the rise of stocks like Rigetti Computing and IonQ. Huang's bullish outlook suggests that quantum computing could soon facilitate breakthroughs in medicine, science, and finance, indicating a significant advancement in computational capabilities. This development marks a potential shift in how complex problems are addressed across various industries.</p>

          <p>Recent protests in Los Angeles have temporarily united factions within the Trump right, revealing a shared opposition to progressive movements and perceived threats to traditional American values. Despite disagreements on issues like trade and spending, the right has coalesced around condemning disorder and calling for a harsh crackdown on protests. This unity stems from a fear of radical left-wing activism, reminiscent of the events of summer 2020, which the right views as an existential threat. The response to the protests underscores the right's emphasis on stability and defense of specific elements of American life, such as religion, cultural values, and national pride.</p>

          <p>A California law designed to reduce greenhouse gases by diverting organic waste from landfills is inadvertently exacerbating illegal dumping in the Antelope Valley. The law requires residents and businesses to separate food waste and yard trimmings, but the lack of infrastructure and demand for compost has made disposal more expensive. This has created financial incentives for waste haulers to dump illegally, threatening the desert ecosystem. Despite state regulations, illegal dumping persists, causing lasting damage to the environment and air quality.</p>

          <p>As heat waves become more frequent and deadly due to climate change, questions arise about who is responsible and what the law has to say. A wrongful-death suit filed by the family of a Seattle woman alleges that fossil fuel companies caused her death by failing to warn the public about the dangers of their products. The author proposes that criminal homicide prosecutions may also be an appropriate response, given evidence that fossil fuel companies knew their actions were likely to cause lethal climate harms. While proving causation could be challenging, the author argues that a combination of civil and criminal enforcement may be the best approach to deter similar future crimes.</p>
