          <p>Hurricane Melissa has intensified into a Category 1 storm in the Caribbean and is expected to become a major hurricane by Sunday. The National Hurricane Center warns of "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides for Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic early next week. The storm is forecast to bring up to 25 inches of rain to some areas, with winds potentially reaching 140 mph. While major impacts on the mainland United States are not anticipated, the system could be the strongest of the Atlantic season.</p>

          <p>A high-profile robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves stole nine "priceless" jewels in under seven minutes, has become a viral phenomenon online. The event has inspired a wave of memes, social media trends, and even tongue-in-cheek advertisements from brands like IKEA and Böcker. While French authorities continue their investigation into the $102 million theft, the public's fascination highlights a cultural preference for dramatic crime stories over more tragic news. The heist's cinematic quality has captured the internet's imagination, turning a major crime into a source of entertainment.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, Dr. Mildred Muhammad, the ex-wife of "D.C. Sniper" John Allen Muhammad, is sharing her story of enduring psychological abuse and his chilling threat to kill her. She details how her ex-husband, an Army veteran, changed after serving in Operation Desert Storm, becoming paranoid and controlling. The 2002 D.C. sniper attacks, which killed 10 people, were theorized by authorities to be part of a plot to murder her and regain custody of their children. Muhammad is now an advocate for domestic violence survivors, hoping her experience can help others recognize and escape abuse.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency, stating "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 loss to Donald Trump, calling him a "tyrant" and asserting her campaign warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct. When asked directly about a future run, she replied "possibly" but said it is not her current focus. Recent polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited enthusiasm for another Harris campaign in 2028.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a disappointing start to the Ashes series, losing 26-6 to Australia at Wembley Stadium in a performance their head coach described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities, while Australia capitalized on key moments to secure a comfortable victory. Australian fullback Reece Walsh was named player of the match for his pivotal contributions. The defeat puts Australia in a strong position to retain the Ashes, needing just one more win in the series.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, sometimes called the "VOO and chill" approach, may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. Financial strategists note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated, with the technology sector now accounting for a record 35% of the index's weight. As a result, investors are increasingly looking toward other areas, such as small-cap stocks, to find better diversification. The Russell 2000 small-cap index recently hit an all-time high, suggesting a broadening of market interest beyond large-cap tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that saving a significant percentage on items like toothpaste and toilet paper over a year can yield a better and more reliable return than trying to navigate the complexities of the stock market. Cuban emphasizes that this strategy is a practical way to save money, rooted in his own experiences of being broke in his 20s.

The study identified turkey and chicken as the most common carriers, and it also found a higher risk of foodborne UTIs in lower-income areas.

          <h2>Trump's Demolition of White House East Wing Sparks Shock and Criticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent demolition of the White House's historic East Wing to make way for a new, privately-funded ballroom has drawn shock and criticism. The structure, which housed the First Lady's office and held significant historical value, was dismantled in a matter of days under the direction of President Donald Trump. Political analysts and commentators have described the act as a departure from presidential norms and a symbol of Trump's disregard for tradition and established checks and balances. The move has been interpreted as a physical manifestation of his unconventional and often disruptive approach to the presidency.</p>

          <p>Following the demolition of the White House East Wing, a reporter from The Atlantic embarked on a quest to find where the historic rubble was taken. The search led from a golf course in East Potomac Park, where truckloads of "White House dirt" were being deposited to create a new hole, to an industrial park in Maryland. While the physical remnants of the building proved elusive, the journey highlighted the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the debris. The article reflects on how a cherished national symbol can be unceremoniously crumbled and hauled away, its final destination largely unknown.</p>

          <p>President Trump's abrupt termination of trade negotiations with Canada could lead to higher prices for American consumers on goods like automobiles, auto parts, and home appliances. The halt in talks may keep steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in place for an extended period. Since these metals are key components in many manufactured goods, the continued tariffs could increase costs for U.S. producers, who are likely to pass them on to consumers. The decision to end the talks was reportedly a response to a Canadian TV ad that featured former President Ronald Reagan speaking critically about tariffs.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. While votes were still being counted, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, a former barrister and lawmaker, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza and was backed by several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms, and will become the third woman to hold the post.</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that the Manhattan condo market has experienced a "lost decade," with median prices per square foot remaining flat compared to ten years ago. More than one-third of condos resold between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold at a nominal loss. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual share of unprofitable sales is likely even higher. The luxury market, particularly properties over $10 million, was the main exception to this trend, continuing to see gains. This price stagnation contrasts sharply with significant home price increases seen across most of the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize rest, revealed its pitfalls when a recent Amazon Web Services outage caused high-tech beds to malfunction. Owners of the $3,000 Eight Sleep mattress cover reported their beds being stuck at freezing or boiling temperatures, or locked in an upright position, because the system relies on a cloud connection. The incident underscores the vulnerabilities of an expanding sleep-tech industry, which offers everything from smart eye masks to neurotech headbands. While some devices can help with medical conditions, the increasing dependence on technology introduces new potential points of failure.</p>

The Pentagon states the deployment is to combat drug trafficking, but Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the U.S. of "fabricating a war." This move follows a U.S. military campaign that has already destroyed several vessels allegedly carrying narcotics. The increased U.S. force presence, which includes stealth fighters and bombers, has heightened fears in Caracas that Washington's ultimate goal is to overthrow the Maduro government.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently underperforming the S&P 500 index by its largest margin of the year, with its stock up 8.6% year-to-date compared to the index's 15.5% gain. This divergence is partly linked to Berkshire's decision to sell a significant portion of its massive stake in Apple. The tech giant's stock has surged over 50% since Berkshire began trimming its position, meaning the conglomerate has potentially left an estimated $50 billion in unrealized profits on the table. Buffett has previously cited the prospect of future capital gains tax hikes as a reason for the sale. (not investment advice)</p>
