          <p>The United States is facing its most severe measles outbreak in over three decades, with more than 1,300 cases confirmed across at least 39 states. A significant cluster in West Texas has resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children, highlighting the serious risks of the disease. Health officials attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold required for community immunity. The article notes that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly encouraged vaccination in response to the growing crisis.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Gdańsk, Poland, have unearthed the complete skeleton of a medieval knight under the former location of a popular ice cream shop. The remains, found just beneath an engraved limestone tombstone, are believed to date back to the 13th or 14th century. Initial analysis suggests the knight was around 40 years old at the time of his death and stood between 5'6" and 5'10". Researchers are now conducting further studies on the well-preserved skeleton and tombstone to determine his identity and the historical context of his burial.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked a group of House Republicans whether he should fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with sources indicating he may proceed with the action. This move, which is legally untested as a Fed chair can only be fired "for cause," could significantly disrupt financial markets. Trump's dissatisfaction stems from his belief that the Fed is not cutting interest rates quickly enough to boost the economy. The discussion has heightened concerns about the Federal Reserve's long-standing independence from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suspended three recently elected Labour MPs—Neil Duncan-Jordan, Brian Leishman, and Chris Hinchliff—for defying the party line. The MPs have had the party whip removed and will now sit as independents in the House of Commons. This disciplinary action follows a significant rebellion where 47 Labour MPs voted against the government's proposed welfare cuts. The move is seen as an attempt by Starmer to reassert his authority following a series of policy reversals and internal dissent within his party.</p>

          <p>According to recent rumors, Apple's forthcoming iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to replace the Plus model, may feature a titanium frame. This design choice is speculated to be a strategic move to ensure the structural integrity of the ultra-thin device, which is rumored to be just 5.5 mm thick. The use of titanium, a strong yet lightweight material, could help Apple avoid a "Bendgate"-style controversy similar to the one that affected the iPhone 6. This would be a key marketing point, addressing durability concerns for the large-screen, slim-profile phone.</p>

          <p>Three Democratic senators have formally raised concerns about a new, searchable citizenship data system developed by the Trump administration. The system, an upgrade to the existing SAVE platform, links immigration and Social Security data, allowing election officials to verify the citizenship status of voters. The senators warn that the tool was rolled out without transparency and could lead to the disenfranchisement of eligible citizens due to potential inaccuracies. Their letter to the Department of Homeland Security questions the system's accuracy, data privacy safeguards, and lack of public notice.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide consumer protection and clear rules for the $250 billion market, defining which digital assets can be called stablecoins and allowing banks to issue their own. Proponents argue that regulation will enable faster, lower-cost financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for stablecoins to "depeg" from their underlying asset.

          <p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is under fire for approving millions of dollars in new grants for research involving dogs, despite a recent announcement to reduce animal testing. According to watchdog group White Coat Waste, the new funding contradicts the NIH's stated goal of prioritizing human-based technologies. The newly approved experiments include toxicology tests and studies involving infecting beagle puppies with viruses. While an NIH official has called dog and cat tests "unconscionable" and pledged to phase them out, critics argue the agency's current actions do not match its rhetoric.</p>

The Los Angeles metro area was also ranked as a top-tier "star hub." The analysis, based on factors like AI job postings and talent, shows that while other hubs are emerging, California's dominance in the AI economy remains profound, even as concerns about job displacement grow.</p>

          <p>A novel insurance program in Ahmedabad, India, is providing financial relief to informal workers, like waste pickers, who lose wages due to extreme heat. The parametric insurance plan automatically pays out a small sum when temperatures exceed a specific threshold for consecutive days. This system helps vulnerable daily wage earners avoid having to choose between their health and their income during record-breaking heatwaves. The program, which doesn't require claims or proof of loss, is being hailed as an effective climate adaptation strategy for a population highly exposed to climate risks.</p>
