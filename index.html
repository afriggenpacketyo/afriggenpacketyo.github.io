        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. President Trump ordered these tariffs to promote domestic manufacturing, but the impact will be broad because many U.S.-made cars use foreign components. Exemptions for parts from Canada and Mexico will ease the burden on some companies, but the tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and increase overall inflation. The article explores the potential consequences of these tariffs on the auto industry and consumers.</p>
