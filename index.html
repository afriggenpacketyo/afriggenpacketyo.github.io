        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has narrowly passed a Republican-led short-term funding bill, aimed at preventing a government shutdown before the September 30 deadline. The measure, which passed 217-212, extends government funding until November 21 but now faces significant opposition in the Democrat-controlled Senate, where it requires bipartisan support to advance. Democratic leaders have criticized the bill as partisan and have indicated it is "dead on arrival," creating uncertainty over how lawmakers will avert a funding lapse as the deadline approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and China over TikTok's ownership are increasingly focused on the app's powerful recommendation algorithm, a piece of technology China has been reluctant to sell. A potential deal could involve a licensing agreement, allowing a new U.S.-based entity to use the algorithm's technology under specific terms rather than owning it outright. This arrangement aims to address U.S. national security concerns about data access by TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, while allowing the app to continue operating in its largest market.</p>

          <p>NATO has intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated the airspace of Estonia, a member of the alliance. The incursion over the Gulf of Finland was condemned by Estonian officials as an "unprecedentedly brazen" and "dangerous provocation," prompting them to summon Russia's chargé d'affaires in protest. This incident follows recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania, heightening tensions between Moscow and NATO amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and reinforcing the alliance's commitment to protecting its eastern flank.</p>

          <p>A growing number of prominent Hollywood actors and filmmakers are pledging to boycott Israel's state-funded film industry in protest of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The movement, inspired by past boycotts against apartheid South Africa, targets institutions rather than individuals to pressure the Israeli government. The action coincides with internal conflict, as Israel's own Culture Minister has threatened to defund the national film academy after it selected an anti-war drama, "The Sea," as its Oscar submission.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has released her highly anticipated sophomore album, "Am I The Drama?," her first full-length project since her 2018 debut. The album features candid lyrics addressing her recent divorce from rapper Offset and her ongoing public feud with fellow artist Bia. Critics have largely praised the record for its raw honesty and energetic delivery, though some have noted its extensive 23-track length. The release marks a significant return to music for the artist after several years of focusing on family and other ventures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday struck down the complaint, criticizing it as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge stated that a legal complaint should not serve as a "megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration." The president's legal team has been given 28 days to refile the lawsuit with appropriate revisions.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, security measures for President Donald Trump are facing heightened scrutiny, especially as he is scheduled to attend a large memorial service for Kirk. The event has prompted federal law enforcement to monitor "several threats of unknown credibility." The incident has amplified pressure on the Secret Service, which has been operating at an elevated threat level since two assassination attempts on the president in 2024, and has led the White House to request an additional $58 million for security funding.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is petitioning the Supreme Court to permit the enforcement of its policy that restricts gender markers on U.S. passports to "biological sex at birth," thereby eliminating the "X" option for nonbinary individuals. This policy reverses a Biden-era rule that allowed applicants to self-select their gender identity. A lower court had blocked the administration's new rule, finding it was motivated by animus and violated equal protection rights. The administration argues the injunction forces it to misrepresent "scientific reality" in its foreign policy communications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. With HELOCs having variable rates, they adjust quickly to changes in the Fed's policy, making them cheaper than fixed-rate home equity loans or credit cards. For a $50,000 HELOC, the monthly payment on a 10-year term has dropped to approximately $608, down from over $640 before the cut, offering homeowners a less expensive way to tap into their home equity.

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping traffic that was lost during recent years of drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers and are developing a new pipeline project, the Interoceanic Energy Corridor, to move natural gas liquids across the isthmus. These initiatives are designed to offer energy companies more flexibility and a reliable alternative to the longer shipping routes they adopted when low water levels restricted canal transits, aiming to restore the canal's role as a critical energy gateway.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time in Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, leading his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in a one-two finish for the team. The session was challenging for McLaren's Lando Norris, who crashed at Turn Four, damaging his car and limiting his track time, a setback he described as "costly." Despite the crash, Leclerc noted that McLaren's pace appeared "very, very impressive" on unfinished laps, suggesting they could be strong contenders in qualifying. Drivers are adapting to softer tire compounds on a track layout that differs from last year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration appears to be shifting its policy on foreign military sales, potentially blocking European allies from purchasing certain high-demand weapons systems like the Patriot missile defense system. Citing shortages in U.S. stockpiles, Pentagon officials have indicated a desire to prioritize American military readiness over fulfilling new orders from Europe. This "America First" approach risks creating rifts with allies at a time of heightened Russian aggression and could undermine both European security and U.S. influence, as demonstrated by Denmark recently opting for a European-made system instead.</p>

          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed a fifth death in the state this year caused by Vibrio vulnificus, a rare flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters. The state has seen a significant increase in infections, with 26 documented cases in 2025, compared to an average of seven cases annually over the past decade. People can contract the bacteria by exposing open wounds to contaminated water or consuming raw seafood. Experts suggest that warming ocean temperatures may be contributing to the bacteria's increased prevalence.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace was achieved through relaxed seller vetting processes, which has allowed counterfeit and fraudulent products to proliferate on the platform. In its effort to compete with Amazon, Walmart made it easier for sellers to join, sometimes leading to vendors using stolen business identities to sell fake goods, including potentially dangerous health and beauty products. While this strategy helped Walmart's e-commerce division become profitable, it has eroded customer trust and exposed shoppers to significant risks.</p>
