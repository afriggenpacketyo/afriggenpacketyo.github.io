        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that Italy can fast-track migrant deportations to designated 'safe countries' if certain conditions are met, including disclosing assessment sources and ensuring protection for all populations. This decision follows a case involving two Bangladeshi nationals whose asylum claims were rejected, leading to an Italian court referral to the ECJ. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the ruling, stating it restricts government action against illegal immigration. The ECJ emphasized that 'safe country' designations must be subject to judicial scrutiny, allowing migrants to challenge decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Switzerland has been hit with a punitive 39% tariff on its exports to the U.S., the highest in Europe and fourth globally, causing widespread shock. This comes despite earlier hints of a favorable 10% tariff and Switzerland's efforts to reduce its own tariffs on US goods to zero and promise investments. The Trump administration's focus on reducing trade deficits is cited as the reason, a view not widely shared by economists. Swiss businesses are warning of thousands of job losses if the tariffs, effective August 7th, cannot be reduced, leading to confusion and anger across the nation.</p>

          <p>Utility workers expanding an underground gas network in Lima, Peru, have unearthed two pre-Incan tombs, one of which contained 1,000-year-old human remains. The individual was found wrapped in a bundle, in a sitting position, alongside four clay vessels and three pumpkin shell artifacts. Archaeologists connect the finds to the Chancay culture, dating back 1,000 to 1,470 years. Lima is known for frequent archaeological discoveries during civil projects, with the gas company Cálidda alone making over 2,200 finds in two decades, highlighting the city's rich historical layers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainty persists, understanding annuities is crucial for retirees seeking guaranteed income. This article outlines five essential rules for prospective annuity buyers this August, including the '1% fee rule' to keep costs low and the '10-year rule' for deferred annuities. It also emphasizes the 'income floor rule' to cover essential expenses with guaranteed income, and the '25% allocation rule' to prevent over-commitment. Finally, the '4% rule' serves as a benchmark for comparing annuity payouts to safe withdrawal rates from traditional portfolios, ensuring informed decisions for long-term financial security (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Millions of student loan borrowers enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan will see interest accrue on their accounts starting August 1, potentially increasing average monthly payments by $300. This change follows court injunctions against the SAVE plan, which led to a temporary zero-interest forbearance. The Education Department cites fiscal responsibility for the resumption, but advocacy groups warn of significant financial impact. Borrowers are advised to check the Federal Student Aid website's loan simulator and evaluate alternative repayment plans, including the upcoming Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) in 2026, to manage growing balances.</p>

While the new Switch 2 console and games will maintain their prices for now, future adjustments are possible. This price hike occurs amid the Trump administration's new wave of 'reciprocal' tariffs, ranging from 10% to 41% on various countries, impacting the broader consumer electronics market.</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs in July, with significant downward revisions for May and June, signaling a cooling labor market. The unemployment rate also rose to 4.2%. Health care and social assistance were the primary drivers of job growth, while professional and business services saw declines. Economists and officials link the slowdown to escalating trade tensions and new tariffs, prompting discussions about potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. President Trump has strongly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering rates, attributing economic improvements to tariffs.</p>

Current forecasts indicate potential wind gusts of 60-70mph in some areas, particularly coasts and hills, with exposed parts of Scotland possibly seeing up to 85mph. While such a low-pressure system is typical for autumn or winter, its occurrence in summer could cause greater impacts due to trees being in full leaf, increasing the risk of fallen branches, power disruption, and damage to temporary structures.

          <p>New federal data reveals a concerning trend: vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners decreased last school year for all reported vaccines, while exemptions rose to an all-time high of 3.6%. This decline comes amidst the highest number of measles cases in over 30 years, with experts warning that falling vaccination rates below the 95% herd immunity threshold increase outbreak risks. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C., with 17 states reporting rates exceeding 5%, prompting public health officials to express worry over unwarranted vaccine concerns.</p>

          <p>A year after Sheikh Hasina's ouster, Bangladesh remains politically polarized, with the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus navigating human rights concerns and the rise of Islamist parties. Despite criticisms from Human Rights Watch regarding arbitrary detentions, the government claims significant progress in reducing rights violations and restoring press freedom. Economically, Bangladesh secured a reduced 20% tariff on its garment exports to the United States, down from an initially proposed 35%, which is comparable to rates for key competitors. This development offers a boost to the nation's vital apparel sector.</p>

          <p>Moderna has revised down the high end of its 2025 revenue outlook by $300 million, citing a delay in Covid vaccine shipments to the U.K. into early 2026. This adjustment comes as the biotech company works to cut costs, including a recent 10% workforce reduction, amidst declining Covid vaccine sales. Despite the revenue forecast cut, Moderna exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, primarily driven by its Covid shot sales. The company's CFO noted that cost-cutting efforts significantly contributed to beating estimates, with operating expenses falling 27% year-over-year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving perception of nicotine, as new tobacco-free products like vapes and pouches gain mainstream acceptance and are marketed with perceived benefits. While these alternatives are considered safer than traditional cigarettes, the long-term health effects of nicotine alone remain largely unknown and are still being studied. Experts caution that nicotine remains highly addictive, comparable to heroin in difficulty to quit, leading to significant financial and psychological tolls on users. The article concludes that while new products address the major health issues of smoking, the more subtle problems of nicotine addiction persist.</p>

          <p>Family offices are intensifying their competition for top talent by implementing more structured long-term incentive compensation plans for executives. A new report indicates that nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices are now using these plans, which link total pay to performance and investment returns. Median total compensation for CEOs at investment-focused family offices is $825,000, rising to over $1.2 million for those with assets exceeding $1 billion. Co-investments, allowing executives to invest alongside wealthy families in lucrative deals, are also becoming a popular incentive, demonstrating a shift towards formalizing compensation to attract specialized professionals (not investment advice).</p>

The ancient method, originally used to protect bronze swords of the Terracotta Army from corrosion, has been upgraded into a modern solution for gun barrel erosion and microcracking. This breakthrough addresses a persistent challenge for high-velocity cannons and advanced howitzers, which face extreme conditions during firing. The study, published in Acta Armamentarii, highlights the innovative application of historical metallurgical knowledge to contemporary military technology.</p>
