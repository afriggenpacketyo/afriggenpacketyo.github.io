          <p>Emory University's Atlanta campus was placed under a shelter-in-place order following reports of an active shooter near Emory Point. Sources indicated that local police exchanged gunfire with a suspect, prompting a major law enforcement response including the Atlanta Police and the FBI. The campus is located near the CDC headquarters, though no immediate connection was established between the incident and the federal agency. High-level officials, including the Georgia Governor and the White House, confirmed they were monitoring the developing situation as first responders worked to secure the area.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The discussions are expected to include potential territorial concessions, a politically sensitive topic for Ukraine. This meeting follows an ultimatum Trump issued for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, with the White House considering secondary sanctions if the deadline is not met. The summit marks a significant diplomatic effort to resolve the long-standing conflict, though it raises concerns about Ukraine's exclusion from direct negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United's manager, Eddie Howe, has stated that striker Alexander Isak is currently not being involved with the first-team group. This development follows the club's rejection of a £110 million bid from Liverpool after the player expressed a desire to explore other opportunities. While not officially disciplined, Isak is training separately from his teammates, and Howe sees the situation as unlikely to change before the season opener. The situation adds to a frustrating transfer window for Newcastle, which is struggling to strengthen its squad ahead of its Champions League campaign.</p>

          <p>According to the latest CDC data, COVID-19 infections are on the rise across the United States, with wastewater monitoring showing the highest levels in western states like California, Alaska, and Nevada. The increase is partly attributed to the new XFG variant, also known as "Stratus," which has become the third-most common strain. While experts note that summer spikes are now a typical pattern, the severity of this wave remains uncertain due to varied population immunity. The rise in cases coincides with the Trump administration's decision to terminate federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Rule Change to Allow Alternative Investments in 401(k) Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 18:08:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to potentially allow alternative investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies, within 401(k) retirement plans. The move aims to democratize access to asset classes that have historically offered high returns but also come with increased risk, higher fees, and less transparency. While proponents believe this could boost retirement savings for Americans, financial experts caution that adoption may be slow due to the complexity and volatility of these investments. The change could significantly impact the private equity industry by opening access to trillions in retirement funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Instagram has introduced a new "Map" feature that allows users to share their real-time location, sparking concerns among privacy experts about data exposure and potential safety risks. Although the feature is off by default and requires users to opt-in, critics worry that users may not fully understand the extent of the information they are sharing. The tool is particularly concerning for younger users, as it could create social pressures and risks of harassment or stalking. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, has addressed user confusion, stating the company is ensuring location is not shared without explicit consent.</p>

Lovell is best known as the commander of the Apollo 13 mission, which famously returned to Earth safely after an in-flight oxygen tank explosion, earning the moniker of a "successful failure." He was also part of the Apollo 8 crew, the first to orbit the moon, and captured the iconic "Earthrise" photograph.

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in some parts of the U.S., particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant declines from their 2022 peaks, a trend attributed to rising housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience tight inventory and rising prices. This regional divergence creates a varied market, offering more balance for buyers in some areas while remaining challenging in others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>USC cornerback Prophet Brown, who had been a standout performer in preseason camp, has suffered a noncontact injury that will sideline him for the beginning of the season. Coach Lincoln Riley confirmed that Brown would miss at least the first few games but expressed hope for his return at some point. The injury is a significant blow to the Trojans' defense, as Brown was considered a top contender for the starting slot corner position. His absence will put more pressure on younger and transfer defensive backs to step up early in the season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding a $1 billion settlement from UCLA and has suspended $584 million in federal research funding. This action follows a Justice Department investigation that concluded UCLA was "deliberately indifferent" to a hostile environment for Jewish students during pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the university must pay a heavy price for civil rights breaches. University of California officials called the demand devastating and warned it would harm students, vital research, and the entire public university system.</p>

An example of this is a new nickel processing plant in Beulah, North Dakota, which has received funding from both the Biden and Trump administrations. The plant will process nickel, a critical material for EV batteries and defense technology, from a Minnesota mine. This strategic investment aims to secure domestic supply chains for essential raw materials, an issue viewed as critical for both economic and national security.</p>
