          <p>Iran has declared it will not resume nuclear talks while under attack, following warnings from Israel about a potential "prolonged" conflict. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats who urged a revival of diplomatic efforts with the US, while his Israeli counterpart spoke of a possible extended campaign. Amidst ongoing fighting, explosions were reported near Tel Aviv, with shrapnel causing a building fire. Araghchi stated Iran would only consider diplomacy once Israel's aggression ceases, insisting on the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program and its right to self-defense. Optimism is tempered by the escalation of conflict. </p>

          <p>Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat against Argentina, highlighting issues with cohesion and execution. Despite creating opportunities through sharp passages of play, the Lions struggled with offloads and passing accuracy. Two-time Lion Tadhg Beirne expressed surprise at the lack of immediate cohesion, considering the presence of "world class" players. Farrell acknowledged the team compounded too many errors, hindering their ability to dictate the pace of the game. The team will need to sharpen up before hitting Australian shores. </p>

          <p>China's real estate sector, already struggling with a downturn, faces further challenges due to a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates a significant decrease in demand for new homes in Chinese urban areas, projecting a drop to under 5 million units per year. This decline is attributed to falling population and slowing urbanization. Despite Beijing's efforts to incentivize child-bearing, the fertility rate continues to fall due to stagnant incomes, job instability, and a weak social security system. The economic costs of raising children and a shift towards individualism are also contributing factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has reportedly requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product. This request, allegedly made by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, has caused anger in Tokyo. The request prompted Tokyo to postpone a planned high-level meeting with Washington. The U.S. has been urging its allies to increase their defense spending to counter growing global security threats. The potential increase in defense spending could significantly impact Japan's economy and security policies. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend, known as "seichi junrei," has become popular since the success of the anime film "your name."

This action is viewed by some as an opportunity for Netanyahu to redefine his legacy after facing criticism for his handling of previous conflicts. The attacks have led to exchanges of bombs, drones, and missiles, causing significant damage. This reflects a significant shift in Israeli foreign policy. </p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed all charges against Barry Morphew in the disappearance of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, just before his trial was set to begin. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to discovering Suzanne's body. Morphew's attorney maintained his innocence, stating there was no physical evidence connecting him to the alleged crime. The defense had previously sought sanctions against the prosecution for failing to turn over exculpatory evidence. This case has had numerous twists and turns over the past several years. </p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he may strike a deal with Harvard University to resolve their ongoing dispute over international student visas. This follows a federal judge's decision to block the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism. Trump has indicated that the potential deal could be "mindbogglingly" historic and beneficial for the country. The legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where a substantial portion of the student body is international. </p>

          <p>Rhode Island's state House has approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who has voiced his support for assault weapons bans. The law only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, similar to Washington state's law. Critics argue the bill does little to curb mass shootings and penalizes law-abiding citizens. Gun control advocates have been pushing for such a ban in Rhode Island for over a decade. </p>

Boelter's wife told investigators that he gave her a "bailout plan" and instructed her to leave the house. Law enforcement found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans' daughter, Hope, shut and locked the door before calling 911, triggering a warning that a "politically motivated act was potentially underway." The families are grappling with the reality of political violence. </p>
