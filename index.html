          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump departed the G7 summit early, citing pressing matters related to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, urging Iranians to evacuate Tehran. G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel and condemning Iran for regional instability and nuclear ambitions. Trump also finalized a trade deal with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, while discussions on tariffs and support for Ukraine remained contentious. The G7 nations' stance contrasted with China's call for de-escalation and its offer to mediate between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>A Russian missile and drone barrage on Kyiv killed at least 14 people, including a U.S. citizen, and wounded dozens more. The attack, one of the deadliest in recent months, struck a nine-story residential building and destroyed numerous apartments. Russia reportedly used 175 drones, over 14 cruise missiles, and at least two ballistic missiles in the assault, which lasted nearly nine hours. The attack occurred as world leaders gathered at the G7 meeting in Canada, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to attend, though a planned meeting with President Trump was canceled due to the latter's return to Washington.</p>

While the dollar index has weakened and U.S. Treasurys faced sell-offs due to tariff rollouts and credit rating downgrades, gold prices have consistently reached new highs.

          <p>The Environment Agency warns that England faces significant future water shortages and needs a "continued and sustained effort" to reduce demand. The agency recommends more hosepipe bans and smart water meters to manage water use. Without action, England will face a daily shortage of more than six billion liters by 2055. The EA calls for customers to cut their water use by 2.5 billion liters a day by 2055, highlighting the impact of population growth and climate change on water supply.</p>
