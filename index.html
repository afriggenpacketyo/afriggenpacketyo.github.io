          <p>The UK is enduring its third heatwave of 2025, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland recording their warmest days so far. Temperatures peaked around 33.1°C in parts of England, prompting amber heat health alerts for the Midlands and southern regions, which warn of risks to the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The extreme heat has led to hosepipe bans for millions and contributed to "extreme" wildfire warnings in Scotland and an active blaze in Surrey. A cooler change with rainfall is expected to break the heatwave for most of the country by Monday.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its decades-long armed conflict with Turkey, beginning a disarmament process with a ceremonial destruction of weapons. This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and has been cautiously welcomed by the Turkish government as an opportunity for reconciliation. The success of the peace process hinges on concessions from Turkey, including potential legal reforms, amnesty for fighters, and the release of political prisoners. If successful, resolving this long-standing conflict could significantly improve Turkey's relations with its neighbors and its overall status in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Workers installing a water pipeline in the historic Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, have discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded in the seabed approximately 30 inches below the ocean floor. A marine archaeologist confirmed the ship dates to the late 18th century based on radiocarbon analysis, making it over 225 years old. The medieval city of Dubrovnik is famously known as a primary filming location for the HBO series "Game of Thrones." The remains of the vessel are now being protected for further examination by experts.</p>

          <p>Amid a tough business climate in China, some luxury hotels are adopting unconventional strategies to survive, including selling budget-friendly street food. The five-star Zhongwu Hotel in Changzhou, for example, has started offering meal boxes prepared by its high-end catering team, with prices ranging from just 20 to 100 yuan (US$3 to US$14). This move represents a significant pivot from their usual expensive banquet services. The hotel's manager stated that the primary goal is to solve the immediate problem of survival by appealing to a broader consumer base with popular and affordable night market favorites.</p>

The government has maintained that it cannot improve upon its 5.4% pay increase for the current year, while doctors argue their real-terms pay is still 20% lower than in 2008. Public support for the strikes has reportedly fallen significantly since last year.</p>

Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event featured a star-studded lineup and was broadcast to nearly 2 billion people worldwide. However, the concert is also being re-examined through a modern lens, facing criticism for its lack of African performers and female artists, which some argue reinforced a "white savior" narrative. Despite the controversy, Geldof maintains the event successfully placed a critical humanitarian issue on the global political agenda through the power of music.</p>

Parents of children with severe allergies have shared stories of adverse reactions caused by unknowingly using products with allergens listed under their Latin names, such as 'Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis' for sweet almond oil.

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant political shift marked by the growing influence of Islamic-oriented parties, posing a challenge to the country's traditionally multi-ethnic and moderate identity. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the conservative Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial ground, particularly among younger Malay voters. This "green wave" is pushing for policies aligned with a more conservative Islamic ideology, such as stricter dress codes and the implementation of Islamic criminal law. Analysts suggest this trend is fueled by public disillusionment with mainstream parties and could lead to a more conservative and bureaucratized form of Islam in the nation's governance.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is reportedly in the final stages of negotiating a migrant return agreement with Iraq, which could be announced by the end of the summer. This development is part of the UK government's broader strategy to tackle illegal immigration. It comes as critics question the effectiveness of a separate, existing deal with France, arguing it has not been sufficient to stop small boat crossings in the Channel. The government is also said to be working on plans for digital ID cards that would be issued exclusively to immigrants as part of its immigration control measures.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming UK Government Report to Warn of Normalized Antisemitism in Society</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:33:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK government-backed report, set to be published Tuesday, will conclude that antisemitism has become normalized within middle-class British society. Co-authored by Lord Mann, the government's antisemitism adviser, the report finds that anti-Jewish sentiment is "pervasive" in institutions like the NHS, universities, and the arts. The authors stated they were "stunned into silence" by the evidence they gathered during their inquiry. One of the key recommendations will be for the government to formally recognize Judaism as an ethnicity, in addition to being a religion, to afford it greater protections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to fears that China's new mega-dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet could cause droughts in India, a new scientific study suggests it might have the opposite effect. Researchers analyzed data from two existing large dams upstream and found they significantly increased water flow during the dry season. The data, measured downstream since 2014, showed that low flows in February were up by more than 50 percent. This indicates that the massive new dam, rather than withholding water, could potentially regulate the river's flow and provide more water to downstream nations like India during their driest months.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied entry, a bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers toured the controversial new migrant detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for access, reported "appalling" conditions, citing extreme heat up to 85 degrees in the medical area and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, a Republican state senator described the beds as comfortable. The visit follows weeks of claims from detainees about inadequate food, lack of showers, and intermittent air conditioning, which state officials have consistently denied as false.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1st. The EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, threatened "proportionate countermeasures," while Mexico's president criticized the "unfair deal" but expressed confidence an agreement could be reached. Trump has warned that he will retaliate with even higher taxes if either trading partner imposes its own duties. The move is part of a broader tariff strategy that has also targeted Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil, escalating global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek of Poland has won her first Wimbledon championship, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a remarkably one-sided final.

          <p>Federal immigration raids on two large cannabis farms in Southern California have resulted in the arrest of 319 immigrants and the death of one farmworker. The worker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, died after falling 30 feet from a greenhouse roof during a raid in Camarillo. The operation sparked tense protests, with demonstrators clashing with federal agents. In response to the events and other recent enforcement actions, a federal judge has temporarily halted immigration raids in the region. Authorities said the raids were based on criminal warrants related to the employment of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.</p>
