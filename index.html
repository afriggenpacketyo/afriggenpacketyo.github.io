          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the suspect in the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, has reportedly agreed to a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. In exchange for pleading guilty to all counts, he is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. This agreement, which has been communicated to the victims' families, also includes a waiver of all his appeal rights. A court hearing to formalize the plea is scheduled for early July, bringing a potential conclusion to the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is accelerating its plan to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to the United States, citing former President Trump's tariffs as a key factor. The company announced a $490 million investment in a new Kentucky plant, a move that is expected to create 800 new jobs in roles like engineering and supply chain management. While the company states the decision aligns with its long-term strategy of producing goods closer to consumers, executives acknowledged that the tariffs expedited the process. The new Kentucky facility is projected to be fully operational by early 2027.</p>

          <p>A proposed U.S. missile defense system, dubbed 'Golden Dome' by former President Trump, aims to bolster protection against long-range missiles and deter military threats from China in the Indo-Pacific. The multi-billion dollar project would rely on a sophisticated network of satellites and space-based sensors to intercept incoming threats. However, the article highlights that significant questions remain regarding the technological feasibility and immense cost of the ambitious defense shield. The project was initiated via an executive order shortly after Trump's inauguration, drawing its name from Israel's 'Iron Dome' system.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of a major tax and spending package supported by former President Trump, suggesting he will fund primary challengers against any Republicans who vote for it. Musk condemned the bill for increasing the national debt and vowed that GOP lawmakers who support it will lose their next primary election. His opposition also stems from the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits, which he argues would harm the country. This stance signals a renewed political engagement from Musk and a significant rift with Trump over fiscal policy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Significant Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 17:59:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial concerns, former President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to 'front-load' before tariffs took effect and some businesses absorbing initial cost increases to avoid losing customers. Additionally, the use of bonded warehouses and various tariff exemptions has kept the effective duty rates lower than the announced figures. However, experts warn that price increases could still materialize later in the year as these buffers diminish. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. consumers may face higher prices and fewer options for fireworks this Fourth of July due to tariffs on Chinese imports. With over 95% of fireworks sold in the U.S. originating from China, a 30% tariff has disrupted the supply chain, as some importers initially halted shipments when a much higher levy was threatened. Major vendors like Phantom Fireworks anticipate price effects on about a third of their products, though they plan to absorb some of the increased costs. The American Pyrotechnics Association noted the timing was particularly damaging, creating a supply problem during the industry's busiest season.</p>

          <p>A massive Republican spending bill moving through the Senate proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, potentially causing millions of Americans to lose health insurance coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Senate's version would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion and leave nearly 12 million more people uninsured by 2034. Health policy experts warn these cuts could be devastating for vulnerable populations, particularly older adults and residents of rural areas. The bill's new work requirements could also lead to coverage losses for those unable to meet the hourly thresholds due to health issues or caregiving responsibilities.</p>

It would also incentivize insurers on the Affordable Care Act marketplace to drop abortion coverage by altering cost-sharing reduction rules.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to clarify how it plans to implement an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and temporary immigrants. Following a partial stay by the Supreme Court on lower court injunctions, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman pressed the government on whether it would attempt to deport babies born in the U.S. before the order is fully litigated. The Justice Department stated it has no immediate plans to do so, but the judge has demanded a written statement outlining the administration's interpretation of its authority, reflecting widespread confusion and fear among immigrant families.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has started a marathon voting session on the Republican 'big, beautiful bill,' a massive legislative package that extends tax cuts and deeply cuts social programs. The bill faces a tight deadline set by former President Trump and significant internal division, as highlighted by retiring Senator Thom Tillis's opposition to its Medicaid cuts. The legislation also includes a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, drawing ire from fiscal conservatives and figures like Elon Musk. Its passage in the Senate remains uncertain, and if it succeeds, it must return to the House for another contentious vote.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the Republican 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' would significantly benefit the wealthiest Americans while financially harming the lowest earners. The report found that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of about $700, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the SNAP food assistance program. Conversely, the top 20% of earners would gain an average of $5,700 per year from the bill's tax cut extensions. These findings suggest the legislation would exacerbate income inequality by shifting resources from the poor to the rich. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Mike Lee has withdrawn a controversial provision from the Republican spending bill that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states. The proposal, intended to create land for affordable housing, faced strong opposition from Democrats, conservation groups, and several fellow Republicans from states like Idaho and Montana. Lee stated he removed the measure because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock.
