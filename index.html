          <p>With Pope Leo XIV signaling the Vatican's willingness to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, following Pope Francis' death, discussions have begun about the possibility of peace negotiations taking place in the Vatican. Italy's head of government, Giorgia Meloni, has spoken with the Pope about steps toward a just and lasting peace. US President Trump and European leaders have requested an assessment of the Holy See's willingness to host negotiations. Experts caution about the Vatican's ability to mediate effectively due to Pope Francis' past benevolent attitude towards Moscow, but the Vatican emphasizes its strict neutrality. The Pope's chief diplomat is expected to hold talks soon, with the US expressing gratitude for the Vatican's willingness to play a constructive role.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how hackers can bypass fingerprint scanners to steal identities, noting that while fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they are not foolproof. Hackers can use masterprints, forged fingerprints using 3D printing, brute force attacks via BrutePrint, side-channel attacks with PrintListener, and exploiting unsecured fingerprint data storage. The article provides six ways to protect fingerprint data, such as choosing trusted phone brands, keeping phones updated, using strong antivirus software, and not relying solely on fingerprints. It concludes that biometrics offer an extra layer of security but should be used in conjunction with passwords or PINs.</p>

The investigation highlights the tension between state-led innovation and accountability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Supreme Court order has sparked debate over the extent of presidential authority, particularly regarding the removal of high-level officials. The court's decision, involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, is viewed by some as granting President Trump increased power to neutralize independent expertise within the executive branch. The author argues that the ruling effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, potentially emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional boundaries. This decision raises concerns about the consolidation of power in the presidency and the erosion of checks and balances.</p>

          <p>Venezuela plans to hold an election for governor and legislators in Essequibo, a territory internationally recognized as part of Guyana, a move seen as an attempt by President Maduro to stir nationalistic sentiment and consolidate power. The Essequibo region, rich in oil, has been a point of contention between Venezuela and Guyana, with most Essequibo residents identifying as Guyanese. Maduro's government has ramped up claims to the region, particularly after significant oil discoveries. This action defies international norms and risks escalating tensions between the two countries, while the International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials to oversee the area.</p>

          <p>An expert discusses the concept of "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes emotional attunement, resilience, trust, and connection. This approach involves accepting children's emotions without dismissal, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility for conflicts, create a safe environment for expressing emotions, and embrace the whole child. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair.</p>

          <p>Johann Strauss II's "Blue Danube" waltz will be transmitted into space to celebrate the 200th anniversary of his birth. The Vienna Symphony Orchestra's performance will be livestreamed, with the European Space Agency relaying a prerecorded version to avoid technical issues. This event also commemorates the ESA's 50th anniversary. NASA previously transmitted the Beatles' "Across the Universe" and Missy Elliott's "The Rain" into deep space. The tourist board in Vienna aims to correct a "cosmic mistake" by sending the waltz, made famous by Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," to its destined home among the stars.</p>

          <p>The article examines the political realignment in Starr County, Texas, a historically Democratic and heavily Hispanic county that voted Republican in 2024. The shift is attributed to the decline of machine politics and the rise of ideological voting, where cultural beliefs outweigh traditional party loyalty. The author argues that this realignment reflects a broader trend of nonwhite voters, particularly working-class Hispanics, moving away from the Democratic Party. The article suggests that Democrats can't fix this by better messaging or more outreach, as the voters moving away are ideologically moderate to conservative.</p>

          <p>China and Russia avoided wording that could irritate Japan in a recent joint statement, with Beijing requesting the removal of references that might damage ties with the neighboring country.

The original draft referred to maintaining security in Northeast Asia and welcomed Chinese investment in disputed islands, but these were removed. This action reflects China's cautious approach to balancing its relationships in the region.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following his predecessor's dismissal. The survey also reveals that 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, lower than the government's target. Support for Prime Minister Ishiba's Cabinet has increased slightly, but a significant portion of respondents desire his resignation at the earliest opportunity. The poll also gauged voter preferences for the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>
