          <p>University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer, which required the surgical removal of his bladder. Appearing with his medical team, Sanders shared that the procedure was successful and he is now considered cancer-free. His doctor explained the high-risk nature of the tumor and confirmed they were able to create a new bladder for him using his own intestines. Sanders expressed gratitude and confirmed he will continue coaching the team this season, hoping his journey encourages others to prioritize their health.</p>

          <p>For the first time, two prominent Israeli human rights groups, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, have accused their own country of committing genocide during the war in Gaza. Their reports cite Israel's military policies, statements from officials, and the systematic destruction of Gaza's health system as evidence. This move breaks a significant taboo within Israeli society, where the term is deeply sensitive due to the Holocaust. The groups acknowledge their position is on the political fringe in Israel but hope their stance will encourage a confrontation with the reality on the ground.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently released emails show that Maine's Education Commissioner, Pender Makin, advised state school districts to ignore executive orders from President Trump, particularly those concerning "radical indoctrination" and transgender athletes in women's sports. The correspondence reveals a direct conflict between state and federal policy, with Makin asserting that Maine's Human Rights Act takes precedence over the federal directives. This defiance led to a national controversy, a Title IX investigation by the U.S. Department of Education, and threats from the President to cut federal funding to the state.</p>

          <p>This article provides a chronological overview of the turbulent trade negotiations between the United States and the European Union throughout 2025. It details the initial imposition of steel and auto tariffs by President Trump, the EU's proposed countermeasures, and the subsequent series of threats and temporary reprieves. The timeline highlights key moments, such as Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement and a threatened 50% tariff hike. The negotiations, marked by deep divisions among EU states, ultimately culminated in a last-minute deal establishing a 15% baseline tariff rate, averting a full-scale trade war for now.</p>

          <p>Following the new US-EU trade agreement, this article analyzes its terms in comparison to the deal previously struck between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. While the UK's baseline 10% tariff rate appears more advantageous than the EU's 15%, the details reveal complexities, such as quotas on UK car exports that could negate the benefit. The analysis also highlights uncertainty regarding how specific sectors like steel and pharmaceuticals will be treated under the EU deal. Ultimately, while the UK seems to have a slight edge, the full economic impact remains unclear pending the final text of the EU agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team has formally petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction. Their central argument is that a non-prosecution agreement made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida should have protected Maxwell from any criminal charges, including those brought in New York. The lawyers contend that the government has an obligation to honor this agreement, which they claim was not geographically limited. This legal move comes after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell, though the Justice Department has urged the court to reject her petition.</p>

The lawsuit argues this unprecedented demand violates federal privacy laws and could deter eligible families from seeking essential food assistance.

          <p>This article outlines five categories of goods that are likely to see price increases for American consumers as a result of the Trump administration's new tariffs. These include cars, as levies are applied to vehicles from the EU, UK, and other nations, and alcoholic beverages like beer and wine, which are major European exports. The analysis also points to potential price hikes for energy and fuel, due to tariffs on Canadian crude oil, and housing, as taxes on Canadian lumber could increase construction costs. Even avocados could become more expensive, highlighting the broad impact of the new trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old teacher, Jason Harrison, has been indefinitely banned from the classroom after a misconduct panel found he encouraged a "vulnerable" young pupil to perform a sex act on him and touched her inappropriately. The incident occurred in 2019 at Notre Dame High School in Sheffield. The panel found the allegations of sexually motivated misconduct were proven and noted Harrison's "complete lack of insight and remorse." The ruling, made on behalf of the education secretary, prohibits him from teaching in any school or youth accommodation in England, with no possibility of overturning the decision.</p>

          <p>For individuals reducing their red meat consumption due to associated health risks like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, nutrition experts highlight numerous alternative sources of iron. Registered dietitians recommend iron-rich foods such as lentils, beans, tofu, and spinach, as well as seafood like oysters and clams. They note that plant-based iron is best absorbed when paired with vitamin C-rich foods. Additionally, fortified breads and cereals are a major source of dietary iron in the U.S. Supplements are also an option, but experts advise consulting a doctor and prioritizing natural food sources first.</p>

Despite prosecutors arguing Hill was never a threat, Coy maintained in court that his actions were justified and that he believed Hill was holding a revolver. Hill's family described him as a gentle man, while body camera footage showed that nearly 10 minutes passed before officers rendered aid after the shooting.</p>

This expansion is part of a multiyear state effort that has nearly doubled Cal Fire's budget and authorized positions since 2017.

He argued that an SNP majority would create undeniable democratic pressure on the UK government to grant another vote. Critics from opposition parties and even within the pro-independence movement have called the strategy risky and out of touch with voters' immediate concerns.</p>
