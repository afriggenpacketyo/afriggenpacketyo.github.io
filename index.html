          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown continues into its third week without a resolution, as Democratic lawmakers express a fundamental lack of trust in President Trump, hindering negotiations. In past deadlocks, bipartisan "gangs" of legislators have formed to broker deals, but this approach is absent now, with Democrats fearing Trump would renege on any agreement. Republican leaders insist on reopening the government before any talks, while Democrats demand an "ironclad path forward," particularly concerning healthcare subsidies, leaving the federal government in a prolonged stalemate.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Trump at the White House to discuss potential U.S. military aid, including Tomahawk missiles, to help end the war with Russia. While Trump expressed a desire to resolve the conflict without escalating with such weapons, he acknowledged Ukraine's request and suggested a possible trade for Ukrainian-made drones. The meeting occurred shortly after Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he plans to meet in Budapest soon.</p>

          <p>The UK government is actively working to reverse a decision that bans fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The ban was implemented by the city's Safety Advisory Group due to significant safety concerns and intelligence about potential violence, following clashes at a previous match in Amsterdam. The move has drawn criticism from political leaders, who argue that fans should not be barred based on their identity.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs has been placed in the concussion protocol after what head coach Brian Schottenheimer described as an "accident" at his home. The injury occurred Thursday night and will force Diggs to miss the upcoming game against the Washington Commanders. This is a significant setback for the Cowboys' defense, which has already been struggling this season and has been hampered by Diggs' previous injuries in recent years.</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached a record high of over $4,300 per troy ounce this week as investors seek a "safe haven" asset amid growing economic anxiety. The surge is attributed to several factors, including the prolonged U.S. government shutdown, ongoing global trade disputes initiated by the Trump administration, and the prospect of lower interest rates. This flight to safety has also boosted silver prices, reflecting widespread investor concern about inflation and geopolitical instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Republican state committee has suspended its Young Republicans chapter after a leak revealed thousands of pages of racist, antisemitic, and violent messages shared by its members in a group chat. The messages, published by Politico, included praise for Hitler, jokes about gas chambers, and derogatory language targeting Black and Indigenous people. The fallout has been swift, with the Kansas GOP disbanding its youth group and several individuals involved losing their jobs or political roles amid widespread condemnation.</p>

          <p>During his visit to Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing the Trump administration not just for long-range missiles but also for enhanced U.S. intelligence sharing. This support would enable more effective Ukrainian drone strikes against Russia's critical energy sector, a key source of Moscow's war funding. The request signifies a strategic shift to cripple Russia's economic capacity to sustain the war, as both nations target each other's energy infrastructure ahead of winter.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that recent aggressive Russian air incursions into NATO airspace have backfired, prompting a more unified and assertive response from the alliance. European members like Poland and Estonia have actively intercepted Russian jets and drones, and NATO has established a new coordinated defense initiative called "Eastern Sentry." This display of resolve, coupled with tougher rhetoric from European leaders, signals a rare alignment with the Trump administration's pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.</p>

Jasmine Beverley held a funeral for her son, Sunny, in 2022 and received an urn of ashes, only to be informed by police in 2024 that the ashes were not his and his body was still at the premises. The former undertaker, Robert Bush, has pleaded guilty to fraud in her case as part of a larger investigation involving dozens of bodies.</p>

          <p>While President Trump positions himself as a peacemaker on the global stage, his domestic actions are dangerously divisive and risk provoking internal conflict, a Guardian columnist argues. The article highlights the deployment of federal troops to Democrat-run cities, which critics view not as a crime-fighting measure but as a political intimidation tactic. This, along with rhetoric casting political opponents as an "enemy from within," is normalizing military presence on American streets and could be a prelude to challenging future election results.</p>

While the risk to the general public is low, officials are urging at-risk groups to get vaccinated, as the virus spreads primarily through close, intimate contact.</p>
