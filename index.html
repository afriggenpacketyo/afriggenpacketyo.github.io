          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 06:10:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Home Office has launched an investigation after data revealed that payment cards issued to asylum seekers have been used for gambling. A Freedom of Information request showed over 6,500 attempted payments in gambling settings over the past year using Aspen cards, which are provided for food and essentials. While online attempts were blocked, the cards were successfully used at physical locations like casinos and lottery retailers. The government has stated it will take urgent action if misuse is confirmed and will ensure physical gambling is not possible in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's shares experienced a significant drop in premarket trading after the company reported its second consecutive quarter of declining automotive sales. The electric vehicle manufacturer missed revenue and profit expectations, with automotive revenue falling 16% year-over-year. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that Tesla could face a few challenging quarters ahead, partly due to expiring federal EV tax credits and increasing competition from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers. Investor concerns have also been linked to Musk's political activities and their potential impact on the company's brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have signed a major free trade agreement aimed at boosting exports and creating jobs in both nations. The deal will reduce tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while making Indian textiles and jewelry cheaper to import into the UK. It also includes a new plan to address illegal migration and extends a national insurance exemption for temporary workers. While the government touts a £4.8 billion annual boost to the British economy, the agreement still requires parliamentary approval.</p>

          <p>Renewed fighting between Thai and Cambodian troops along their disputed border has resulted in the deaths of at least 12 people, the majority of whom were Thai civilians. The conflict, which stems from a century-old territorial dispute, escalated with both sides exchanging gunfire and accusing the other of initiating the violence. In response, Thailand has evacuated tens of thousands of civilians and closed the border, while Cambodia has downgraded diplomatic ties. This event marks a significant deterioration in relations, which have been increasingly tense for several months.</p>

          <p>Swiss food giant Nestle has indicated that prices for products like KitKat and Nespresso may rise further this year due to soaring coffee and cocoa commodity costs and the impact of U.S. tariffs. Although the company reported better-than-expected sales growth driven by earlier price hikes, it warned that profit margins in the second half of the year will be significantly lower. The world's largest packaged goods company is navigating an unprecedented scenario with two of its major commodities at historical highs, forcing it to pass on costs to consumers.

          <p>Despite death's inevitability, many Americans find it the most difficult taboo topic to discuss, ranking it lower than money, sex, or religion. This cultural avoidance, which has roots in the 19th-century professionalization of the funeral industry, has tangible consequences, as less than half of U.S. adults have a will or advance directive. The article explores how this silence leads to emotional and logistical difficulties for grieving families. It also highlights a growing "death positive" movement that advocates for more transparency and open conversation around dying and end-of-life planning.</p>

          <p>During a summit in Beijing, European Union officials pressed China to address a growing trade imbalance, revealing underlying tensions despite diplomatic efforts to deepen ties. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the relationship has reached an "inflection point" and requires rebalancing. The EU has become increasingly concerned about China's export of excess industrial supply, such as electric vehicles, which has led to protective tariffs. Meanwhile, China seeks a reversal of these restrictions, highlighting the mismatched expectations and strained relations between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An inquest has determined that a 10-year-old boy, Oliver Price, died from a head injury sustained in a school coach crash in Somerset. He was a passenger on a coach carrying Minehead Middle School pupils returning from an end-of-year trip when it left the road and slid down an embankment. The coroner's court heard that Oliver was found in his seat with his seatbelt fastened and was declared dead at the scene. A full inquest is scheduled for January to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crash.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking the 2009 "endangerment finding," a key determination that allows the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. This finding serves as the legal foundation for numerous climate policies, including limits on emissions from power plants and vehicles. The administration argues the original finding was flawed, while critics view the move as a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry that undermines efforts to combat climate change. If successful, the reversal would significantly hinder future climate regulations.</p>

          <p>China is accelerating its approval of innovative pharmaceuticals, with a record 43 new drugs approved in the first half of 2025, a 59% increase from the previous year. According to the National Medical Products Administration, many of these treatments target serious conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. This rapid pace reflects reforms in the country's review and approval processes, which have encouraged greater R&D investment from pharmaceutical companies. The trend signals a potential shift in drug discovery momentum from Western countries to China, which is the world's second-largest biomedicine market.</p>

          <p>This article traces President Trump's long-standing opposition to wind turbines, from a personal dispute over his Scottish golf course to his current administration's global anti-renewable energy policies. As president, Trump has moved to squash clean power development in the U.S. by barring projects on federal lands and signing legislation that curtails support for the industry. This policy shift is expected to eliminate jobs, increase electricity costs, and add billions of tons of carbon pollution, starkly contrasting with China's rapid expansion of renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A major new study challenges the common belief that a sedentary lifestyle is the main cause of rising obesity rates. Researchers compared the daily calorie burn of people from diverse cultures, including active hunter-gatherers and office workers, and found surprisingly similar levels of total energy expenditure when adjusted for body size. This finding provides strong evidence that changes in diet, particularly the rise of ultra-processed foods, are the primary driver of the obesity epidemic. Experts note this shifts the focus from blaming inactivity to addressing the modern food supply.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed into law a major overhaul of the federal student loan system that will phase out the generous Biden-era SAVE repayment plan. The legislation introduces new, tighter borrowing limits for graduate students and parents and reduces the number of repayment options to two new plans. The new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) will offer income-based payments and prevent loan balances from growing due to interest. However, it also extends the timeline for potential loan forgiveness to 30 years, affecting millions of current and future borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
