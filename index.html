          <p>An Israeli drone strike in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza has killed ten Palestinians, including six children, who were queueing for water. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, attributing it to a "technical error" with a strike aimed at an Islamic Jihad militant, and stated the matter is under review. The event adds to a rising death toll near aid distribution sites, with the International Committee of the Red Cross reporting its field hospital is overwhelmed with mass casualty incidents. The UN has documented hundreds of aid-related killings, highlighting the severe dangers civilians face while seeking essential supplies.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland recording their warmest days so far. Temperatures peaked at 33.1°C in England, leading to amber heat-health alerts and hosepipe bans for millions. The heat has also contributed to wildfires and a tragic river death in Glasgow. The Met Office forecasts a break in the heatwave starting Monday, with cooler temperatures and rain expected for most of the country, though the southeast may remain warm.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers. This move aims to accelerate the transition away from petrol and diesel cars, addressing the high upfront cost which is a major barrier for many drivers. The government also plans to invest £63 million in charging infrastructure, including funding for "cross-pavement gullies" to help residents without driveways install charge points. The policy is intended to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team conducting a sonar survey of the Fox River in Wisconsin has accidentally discovered a well-preserved 19th-century shipwreck. The Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association were mapping the riverbed for other known cultural sites when they found the unexpected hull. The wreck is believed to be the L.W. Crane, a 90-foot wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880. The discovery highlights the rich maritime history hidden in the region's waterways, and further investigation is planned.</p>

          <p>Negotiations for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas are facing significant hurdles, particularly concerning the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza. A major point of contention involves the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which Hamas wants eliminated from the region. The GHF and the United Nations are in a public dispute over casualty figures near aid sites, with the GHF accusing the UN of using false data from Hamas and behaving like a "mafia." This conflict between aid organizations complicates the already difficult path to securing a deal and providing relief to Palestinian civilians.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has created a novel biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, commonly known as white sugar. This breakthrough offers a potential pathway to turn captured carbon dioxide, which can be used to produce methanol, directly into a food source. The method, developed at the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, bypasses the need for traditional agriculture like growing sugar cane, which requires significant land and water. The scientists suggest this technology could help address both environmental challenges and food security issues.</p>

Instead, they argue, the establishment co-opted the movement's energy while police budgets increased and authoritarian tactics became more common.

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in the Texas Hill Country, questions are being raised about the state's resistance to investing in disaster preparedness. Despite being the most disaster-prone state in the US, Texas has a history of prioritizing recovery over prevention, a pattern seen after Hurricane Ike in 2008 and the 2021 winter storm. Critics attribute this to a political culture of small government and skepticism of climate change, influenced by the fossil fuel industry. This reluctance to act is becoming more critical as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the state.</p>

These tariffs, which businesses pass on to customers, are increasing the cost of everyday products and contributing to economic uncertainty. Experts advise consumers ordering internationally to be aware of potential duties and to verify any payment requests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A child who had contracted measles has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, which has seen a significant increase in seriously ill children with the virus. While the hospital did not release specific details, the death highlights a concerning surge in measles cases in the region, linked to falling vaccination rates. The UK Health Security Agency has warned that measles is a highly infectious and dangerous disease, especially for young infants and those with weakened immune systems. Health officials are urging parents to ensure their children receive the MMR vaccine.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the focus remains on the catastrophic security lapse by the U.S. Secret Service. The attack, which killed fire chief Corey Comperatore, prompted multiple investigations that revealed failures in intelligence, coordination, and resources. In response, the Secret Service has outlined 37 reform measures, but experts note the agency has been underfunded and overstretched since its mission expanded after 9/11. Many of the necessary long-term fixes, including budget increases and staffing, still require elusive congressional action to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>The assassination attempt on Donald Trump one year ago is remembered as a moment that profoundly shook the US political landscape. The image of a bloodied but defiant Trump rallying his supporters galvanized his base, who saw his survival as a sign of divine intervention. The event created a stark contrast with then-President Biden, who dropped out of the race just eight days later amid concerns over his fitness, a decision that continues to cause division among Democrats. The shooting is viewed as a symptom of a growing culture of political violence and a pivotal event that fueled Trump's path back to the presidency.</p>

Beijing responded with formal protests, insisting that the process must adhere to Chinese law and tradition, and accused India of interfering in its domestic affairs.

By announcing his retirement ahead of his final season, Bryant was able to control his own narrative and receive an outpouring of appreciation from fans nationwide.

The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, will split the current Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two, elevating housing to a cabinet-level priority. Supporters hope this reorganization will streamline the state's complex and fragmented funding systems for affordable housing development.

          <p>Economists report that the class of 2025 is struggling to find employment in an increasingly difficult job market, with fewer opportunities available for new entrants. Factors contributing to the slowdown include job cuts in the federal government and tech sector, as well as general caution from employers due to economic uncertainty. As a result, many recent graduates are having to be more flexible in their searches and are often settling for lower salaries than they had anticipated. While challenging, experts note that a college degree remains a valuable long-term investment for career prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

While the government insists it cannot increase the pay offer, it is reportedly open to discussing improvements in working conditions.

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the final fight of the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy, framing it as a landmark moment for women's boxing. The author argues that the tactical, less chaotic nature of the third fight demonstrated progress, as the athletes fought to win rather than just to entertain, earning the right to be "boring" like their male counterparts. However, the article also notes the contradictions that persist in the sport, from disparate pay to the sexualized presentation of ring girls. The piece concludes that while Taylor and Serrano have advanced the sport, its future depends on addressing these larger issues.</p>
