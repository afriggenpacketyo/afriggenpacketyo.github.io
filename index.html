          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed strong confidence that the Trump administration will secure significant trade deals with key partners before a looming August 1 deadline. He stated that the threat of steep tariffs on nations including the European Union, Canada, and Mexico has successfully brought them to the negotiating table. Lutnick dismissed concerns that the tariffs would lead to higher consumer prices, asserting that Americans can expect "shockingly low" prices and that the policy will ultimately benefit U.S. manufacturers.

          <p>A report from Senator Joni Ernst's office found that the State Department under the Biden administration authorized over $1.2 million in taxpayer funds for renovating swimming pools at U.S. embassies. The spending included projects in countries facing significant turmoil, such as Iraq, Sudan, and Haiti, as well as a $41,259 pool rehabilitation at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, contracted after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The report has renewed criticism of what some lawmakers describe as wasteful government spending.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has sharply criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, stating that federal raids have created a pervasive atmosphere of fear throughout the city. She condemned the tactics used by ICE agents, such as wearing masks and using unmarked vehicles, which she said resemble kidnappings and terrorize the community. Bass also argued that the deployment of National Guard troops to the city was an unnecessary and politically motivated misuse of taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that finding "common ground" on divisive issues is often impossible in today's political climate. Instead, he advocates for seeking "neutral ground"—shared activities or interests, like surfing, where people with opposing views can connect as friends without focusing on their differences. He argues that these personal connections are more important than ever and can lead to more productive discussions about disagreements.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and his office have adopted a more combative and aggressive social media strategy to push back against President Trump and his allies. This new approach, which includes using insults and memes, marks a significant shift from the traditional Democratic motto of "when they go low, we go high." Newsom's advisors say the change was prompted by the deployment of federal troops to Los Angeles for immigration raids, and they argue it's an effective way to challenge a bully and counter misinformation.</p>

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. She argues that validating a child's feelings, rather than dismissing them, builds emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. By modeling self-connection and allowing children to express their full range of emotions, parents can protect their long-term mental health and self-esteem.</p>
