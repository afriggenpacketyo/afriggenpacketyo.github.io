        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) had previously warned staff about the risks of sharing data with hidden tabs, according to documents from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This revelation follows a 2022 leak of sensitive details belonging to almost 19,000 Afghans seeking resettlement, an incident government officials internally labeled "the most expensive email ever sent." The ICO chose not to fine the MoD, citing a desire to avoid additional taxpayer costs, despite concerns raised by its own staff regarding the lack of independent investigation and a smaller fine issued for a similar breach in 2023. The MoD claims to have since improved data security, but the ICO asserts that the pace of change is insufficient.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian drone and missile attack struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early Thursday, resulting in at least ten deaths, including two children, and approximately 48 injuries. The assault marked the first major combined attack on Kyiv in weeks and included a rare strike in the city's center, damaging nearly 100 buildings. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, accusing Russia of choosing "ballistics instead of the negotiating table" and urging a stronger global response. Rescue teams are actively searching for survivors amidst the rubble, as the incident casts a shadow over recent U.S.-led peace efforts.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to attend a military parade in Beijing in early September, commemorating Japan's surrender in World War II. China's Foreign Ministry confirmed Kim's visit, emphasizing the shared history and solidarity among the three nations. This gathering signals a united front against US-led alliances in Asia and offers Putin an opportunity to counter his international isolation following the invasion of Ukraine. Kim's attendance is also seen as an effort to boost his global standing and potentially revive diplomacy with former US President Donald Trump, while seeking economic ties with China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia announced a 56% surge in revenue to $46.7 billion for the second quarter, driven by strong demand from major tech firms expanding their AI capabilities. CEO Jensen Huang noted the "AI race is now on," with significant spending increases from companies like Meta and OpenAI. Despite this growth, Nvidia's shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading due to data center revenue missing estimates and ongoing concerns about US-China geopolitical tensions. The company continues to lobby the Trump administration regarding sales of its advanced AI chips to China, a crucial market where US export restrictions are also fueling domestic chipmaking competition.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Four-Year Limit on Foreign Student Visas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 02:27:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new rule that would limit the duration of stay for international students in the U.S. to four years, aiming to curb "visa abuse" and enhance oversight. This policy change would replace the current "duration of status" rule, which allows students to remain as long as they are enrolled full-time. The Department of Homeland Security argues that some foreign students exploit the system to stay indefinitely, posing security risks and burdening taxpayers. Critics, including international education associations, warn that the rule could deter foreign students, negatively impacting American economies and global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister summoned the top U.S. diplomat after reports emerged that individuals connected to President Donald Trump are conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. Public broadcaster DR reported that at least three Americans are allegedly compiling lists of US-friendly Greenlanders, identifying Trump opponents, and seeking information to cast Denmark in a negative light. While the U.S. State Department confirmed a meeting, it denied controlling private citizens' actions. Danish officials stated any interference in the Kingdom's internal affairs is unacceptable, amid ongoing US interest in the strategically important Arctic territory, which Denmark and Greenland insist is not for sale.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Church, a Catholic school in Minneapolis, resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, and injuries to 17 others, including 14 children. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, as the suspect used three firearms and a smoke bomb. Authorities discovered a manifesto timed to publish on YouTube, which has since been removed. This tragic event has deeply traumatized the community, with calls for action beyond mere condolences.</p>

          <p>The widespread emotional reactions to news of Taylor Swift's engagement have brought the concept of parasocial relationships into the spotlight. Fans expressed intense joy and tears, illustrating how individuals develop strong, one-sided emotional connections with celebrities, influencers, or public figures they don't personally know. Psychologists describe these as "my friend who doesn't know me," fueled by the extensive personal information shared through social media and reality shows. While these relationships can foster a sense of community and connection, especially online, experts caution that they cannot replace the reciprocal nature of real-life friendships, offering emotional "fast food" without true nutritional content.</p>

          <p>The value of small packages shipped from China to the UK, exempt from import duties under current rules, more than doubled last year to £3 billion, according to HMRC data. This surge is largely attributed to the popularity of Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, which offer affordable goods to UK consumers. The UK government is reviewing the £135 customs duty exemption, prompting calls from British businesses and industry groups for swifter action. They argue that the loophole undercuts High Street retailers and exposes consumers to potentially unsafe products, while also highlighting lost tax revenue for the UK.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stark warning that Donald Trump is gravely serious about seeking a third term as president, despite constitutional limits. Newsom, a Democrat, cited a private Oval Office conversation where Trump reportedly pointed to a portrait of Franklin D.

Newsom urged Americans to "wake up" to what he perceives as Trump's disregard for democratic norms and a potential threat to the rule of law.

Lee previously indicated that South Korea's evolving supply chains mean it can no longer maintain a policy of relying on the US for security while solely cooperating with China economically.

          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, has reported its slowest earnings growth in a decade, with first-half revenue rising 4.2% and net profit increasing 2.3%.

Other major distillers, like Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor, have also experienced similar decelerations or plunges in their financial performance.

The search was reignited when Dutch newspaper reporters spotted the artwork in an ad for a villa owned by descendants of the alleged Nazi fugitive, Friedrich Kadgien. While police found German documents from the 1940s during a raid, the painting itself was not recovered, highlighting Argentina's history as a post-WWII refuge for Nazis.</p>

The initiative, costing $4,000 per robot, aims to improve detection rates of the highly camouflaged snakes, which have decimated native mammal populations by up to 95%. While the project is in its early stages, officials are optimistic about its potential to help control the estimated tens of thousands to 300,000 pythons in the region.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and the Philippines are mounting at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal as a resupply deadline for the grounded BRP Sierra Madre looms. A Philippine Navy spokesman reported sighting a Chinese tugboat near the ship, while satellite data showed Chinese coastguard vessels intercepting Philippine ships attempting to approach the shoal. This escalation follows a period of relative coexistence and highlights renewed friction in the South China Sea. The Philippines maintains a military presence on the shoal, which China also claims, making resupply missions a frequent point of contention and potential conflict.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased an ace-like pitching performance, leading the Dodgers to a 5-1 victory and a sweep of the Cincinnati Reds. In his best outing since resuming two-way duties after Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched five innings of one-run ball, striking out nine batters and demonstrating a new, unpredictable plan of attack by utilizing a wider array of pitches. This performance marks a significant step in his rehabilitation and potential role as a frontline starter in the postseason, addressing previous concerns about his ability to navigate lineups multiple times. The win extended the Dodgers' winning streak and strengthened their division lead.</p>

          <p>USC has extended a multi-year offer to Notre Dame, hoping to preserve their historic 100-year-old football rivalry beyond the current season. This amended proposal addresses Notre Dame's preference for a long-term deal, following public outcry over the potential end of the series. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a swift agreement, despite previous reluctance due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, as USC seeks to move it earlier in the season to better balance its conference schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change the traditional late-season matchup.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record, with one million hectares burned across the EU so far this year, equivalent to half the land area of Wales. Spain and Portugal have been particularly devastated, with roughly 1% of the Iberian Peninsula scorched, largely in just two weeks. This escalating crisis is directly linked to climate change, which increases the likelihood of extreme heat and dry vegetation, according to the World Weather Attribution group. The fires are also releasing record amounts of CO2, creating a vicious feedback loop and posing significant threats to ecosystems, soil, and water quality.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has begun transferring detainees from the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. This action follows a federal judge's ruling that parts of the state-run facility must be dismantled. DHS criticized the order from an "activist judge," asserting it hinders efforts to remove undocumented immigrants. The facility, part of a broader Trump administration push to expand detention capacity through state partnerships, has faced allegations of inhumane conditions, including inadequate access to water and legal counsel. Florida's government has appealed the ruling, which did not mandate immediate closure but halted new construction.</p>

Cardi B reiterated that she never touched or scratched Ellis, accusing her of seeking a $24 million payout. The obstetrician's receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, testified that Ellis cornered Cardi B and reached for her, resulting in a cut on Malcolm's forehead, which she attributed to Ellis. The doctor also stated Ellis had no visible injuries and that he saw Ellis cause Malcolm's injury, supporting Cardi B's denial of physical contact.</p>

          <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been plunged into chaos following the ousting of its director, Susan Monarez, less than a month after her Senate confirmation. Monarez's lawyers contend she was targeted for her pro-science stance and refusal to endorse "unscientific, reckless directives" from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been criticized for vaccine skepticism and budget cuts. Her removal triggered a wave of resignations from senior CDC leaders, including the chief medical officer and director of immunization, who cited concerns about the "weaponizing of public health" and the "intentional eroding of trust" in vaccines. The White House confirmed Monarez's termination, stating she was "not aligned with the President's agenda."</p>
