        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles following clashes between residents and ICE agents in a predominantly Latino district, after ICE operations resulted in 118 arrests this week. Governor Newsom condemned the raids as "cruel" and spoke with Trump for 40 minutes, but details of their conversation remain unknown. The White House stated that the deployment addresses lawlessness and protects federal agents, while Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth indicated potential mobilization of active-duty Marines if violence continues. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused ICE of "sowing terror," escalating tensions between local and federal authorities, as concerns grow over the federal government's intervention in local law enforcement matters. Optimism regarding the situation is low given the escalated tensions and potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted across Los Angeles after ICE operations led to 118 arrests, prompting President Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to the county. Demonstrators clashed with law enforcement, and some attempted to obstruct a U.S. Marshals Service bus, leading to the use of non-lethal munitions. Homeland Security reported that the arrests included individuals linked to criminal organizations, and among those arrested was David Huerta, a regional president of the Service Employees International Union. Governor Newsom criticized the federal government's move as inflammatory and an erosion of public trust, while Mayor Bass stated that city officials were working with federal authorities to find a resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority, bypassing Governor Newsom's approval, raises significant legal questions. Title 10 allows the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but constitutional law scholars argue that using the military to quell protests without the governor's request is a chilling act. Critics also fear the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which would allow the president to federalize state National Guard units to suppress domestic unrest. Concerns are growing that the administration seeks to send a message to protesters by using federal troops to suppress dissent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, with a fertility rate well below the level needed for population sustainability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing back against protests opposing immigration raids in Los Angeles, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowing to continue enforcing the law. Stephen Miller described the protests as a "violent insurrection," while David Huerta, a senior union official, was arrested and hospitalized during protests at a federal detention facility. Huerta released a statement condemning the treatment of hard-working people as criminals, and the article provides a summary of key Trump administration stories related to the ICE raids.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggesting hints of biological activity on the distant planet K2-18b is now being questioned by scientists. While initial findings indicated the presence of molecules produced by living things on Earth, new research suggests these compounds can also form without life. Multiple teams of astronomers have re-evaluated the data and models used in the original study, yielding different results and emphasizing the complexities of searching for extraterrestrial biosignatures. The ongoing research highlights the scientific process and the high burden of proof required to confirm evidence of life beyond Earth.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing challenges in ensuring adequate sanitation during disasters, highlighted by the "toilet panic" following the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The earthquake disrupted water and sewage systems, leading to unsanitary conditions in evacuation centers, and many people lack knowledge on using portable toilets. Educators are now teaching elementary school students about portable toilet usage to improve disaster preparedness, and experts urge people to stockpile portable toilets at home and in workplaces. The government is also required to make efforts to prevent unsanitary conditions in evacuation center toilets.</p>

They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation, worker wellbeing, and access to funding and resources, and younger generations are less tolerant of toxic work environments.</p>

The referendum aims to streamline the process for legal immigrants who contribute to the country, but critics argue it would dilute Italian identity.
