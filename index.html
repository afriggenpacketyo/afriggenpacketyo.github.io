          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has firmly stated he will not withdraw from the mayoral race, dismissing reports of a potential ambassadorial nomination from Donald Trump's camp as a way to sideline him. Adams is facing low poll numbers in a competitive race against Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani. He strongly criticized former Governor Andrew Cuomo, another independent candidate whom Trump suggested could beat Mamdani, calling him a "snake and a liar." Adams, running as an independent, asserted his commitment to serving the city and his belief that he is the only candidate capable of defeating the Democratic nominee.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal authorities, led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), detained 475 people in a major immigration enforcement operation at a Hyundai Motor Group facility in Georgia. The raid, described as the largest of its kind at a single site, targeted individuals suspected of working in the country illegally, many of whom were Korean nationals employed by subcontractors. While no immediate criminal charges were announced, the operation is part of an ongoing investigation into unlawful employment practices. The action has drawn criticism from labor advocates who call it a politically motivated campaign of harassment against immigrant workers.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Maine have reported three active cases of tuberculosis in the Greater Portland area, reflecting a continuing national trend of rising TB cases since 2021. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting contact tracing to test individuals who may have been exposed, noting that each case appears to have a separate source. Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection primarily affecting the lungs, is the world's deadliest infectious disease but is not as contagious as viruses like the flu. This local report comes as other states, including California and Michigan, have also recently identified new cases in community settings like high schools.</p>

Despite being 41 years older than the next oldest member, he was not given any special treatment by the band director.

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a new long-term compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth approximately $900 billion, potentially making him the world's first trillionaire. The plan is contingent on the company achieving ambitious market capitalization and production goals over the next decade, including growing its value to $8.5 trillion.

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. is facing intense criticism for his radical overhaul of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has included firing its new director and the entire vaccine advisory panel. These actions have prompted resignations from senior staff and raised alarms among public health experts who fear the agency's scientific integrity is being compromised. Kennedy, a known vaccine critic, has defended his actions as necessary to reform a "corrupt" agency. The turmoil at the CDC, a historically pivotal organization in global health crises, has created concerns worldwide about the potential impact on future pandemic preparedness and response.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged their copyrighted books were used without permission to train its AI model, Claude. If approved, the settlement would compensate authors approximately $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 books involved. A key aspect of the case was a judge's ruling that while training on legally obtained books was fair use, using pirated copies was not. This settlement is seen as a major precedent in the ongoing legal battles between creative industries and AI developers over training data.</p>

Certified public accountant Dan Geltrude advises that while he would personally choose the lump sum for investment control, it can be a "dangerous" option for many, as overspending has led past winners to bankruptcy. The annuity provides a safer, more stable stream of income over time.

          <p>Chelsea started their Women's Super League title defense with a victory against rival Manchester City, demonstrating their characteristic ruthlessness despite not being at their peak performance. The match featured debuts for new players on both sides, including Chelsea's high-profile signing Ellie Carpenter, who made an immediate impact by assisting the opening goal. While Manchester City showed creative pressure and a new dynamic style under their new manager, they failed to convert key chances. The result reinforces Chelsea's position as the team to beat, though the season has only just begun and both teams are still developing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a sudden change to their pitching rotation, with Shohei Ohtani stepping in to start against the Baltimore Orioles on short notice. The scheduled starter, Tyler Glasnow, was scratched due to back tightness, which the team hopes is not a serious issue. Ohtani, who had his own recent start postponed due to illness, volunteered to take the mound for his first pitching appearance since August 27. Manager Dave Roberts praised Ohtani's willingness to alter his routine for the team's needs and hoped it would provide a boost after a recent series sweep.</p>

          <p>Scotland began its World Cup qualifying campaign with a hard-fought 0-0 draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Head coach Steve Clarke praised the performance as a "good start" but emphasized the need for consistency in the upcoming matches to secure a place in the finals for the first time since 1998. Clarke employed a tactical formation change to counter Denmark's physicality, a lesson learned from a previous defeat. The result gives Scotland a crucial point in a competitive group that also includes Greece and Belarus, setting a solid foundation for their qualification bid.</p>

          <p>President Trump experienced a challenging week marked by significant setbacks across multiple fronts. His economic agenda was strained by a federal court ruling against his tariff authority and a jobs report showing a labor market contraction. Diplomatically, overtures to Russia appeared to backfire as Vladimir Putin visited Beijing for a military parade. In Washington, the administration faced bipartisan criticism over its public health policies and growing pressure to release files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. These events were compounded by a series of unfavorable court rulings on issues ranging from military deployment to migrant protections.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian fashion designer who died at age 91, is being remembered for transforming Hollywood's red carpet from a chaotic fashion landscape into a global runway. Beginning in the 1980s, Armani pioneered the practice of dressing celebrities for major events, using the film industry to build his brand. His signature unstructured, elegant suits, famously worn by Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," redefined power dressing for both men and women. By establishing a dedicated presence in Hollywood, he created a system of designer-celebrity partnerships that now dominates awards season, forever changing the relationship between fashion and film.</p>

He positioned Reform UK as the only party standing up for working people and suggested the political instability could lead to a general election sooner than expected. Farage announced plans to vet 5,000 candidates for future elections and create a new policy department to prepare for a potential role in government. The conference, marked by a professional atmosphere and the presence of corporate lobbyists, aimed to project Reform as a rising political force.</p>

          <p>A scandal is unfolding in Australia after an independent consumer group found that several popular and expensive sunscreens failed to provide their claimed level of sun protection. The most significant failure was a product from Ultra Violette, which tested at SPF 4 instead of its advertised SPF 50+, leading to a product recall. The findings have caused public outrage in a country with the world's highest skin cancer rates and have prompted an investigation by the national medical regulator. The controversy has raised questions about sunscreen testing standards and regulations, with experts suggesting the issue may not be isolated to Australia.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist has shared her experience of interviewing surgeon Neil Hopper, who was recently jailed for insurance fraud after it was revealed he intentionally froze his own legs so they would require amputation. Hopper had publicly claimed his amputations were the result of sepsis from a camping trip, a story he used to gain media attention and fraudulently collect over £466,000 from insurers. The truth emerged during an investigation into an extreme body modification ring, which exposed Hopper's long-standing obsession and sexual interest in amputation. The journalist reflects on the difficulty of uncovering such a complex and bizarre deception, which fooled medics and insurance companies alike.</p>

          <p>The latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy, with only 22,000 jobs added in August, far below predictions. The unemployment rate also rose slightly to 4.3%. Compounding the negative outlook, the BLS made downward revisions to previous months' data, revealing a net loss of 13,000 jobs in June. This report is the second consecutive one to deliver disappointing news, strengthening concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. The weak numbers increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>
