        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his far-right party from the governing coalition over disagreements on migration policies. Wilders demanded stricter asylum measures, including freezing applications and limiting family reunification, which other coalition members found legally problematic. Political leaders expressed shock and anger, accusing Wilders of engineering the crisis, while the opposition celebrated the end of a quarrelsome coalition. Economists believe the immediate economic impact will be minimal, as the government had few concrete plans during its brief tenure; it is likely that Wilders will make asylum a central issue in the upcoming election campaign. The political instability comes as the Netherlands is scheduled to host the NATO summit at the end of the month.</p>

Isaac, who wears his own brand on the court, explains that UNITUS aims to inspire positive change through premium Christian clothing and footwear. He stresses that the company avoids imposing its beliefs on others, focusing instead on providing reminders of faith for the wearer. Isaac revealed that he started his own sneaker line after Nike chose not to re-sign him following an ACL injury, allowing him creative autonomy to express his faith through his apparel. Despite potential backlash for speaking out about his beliefs, Isaac prioritizes minimizing his time on social media and filtering out negativity.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the United States, which is classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon. The Justice Department alleges that Jian and Liu were receiving Chinese government funding for their research, some of which was conducted at the University of Michigan. Jian's electronics reportedly contain information indicating her membership in and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. Liu initially lied to authorities about smuggling the fungus but later admitted to concealing it to conduct research at the University of Michigan. The fungus causes "head blight," a disease affecting wheat, barley, maize, and rice, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses annually.</p>

Documents indicate that other vessels named after prominent leaders, such as the USNS Thurgood Marshall and USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, are also on the renaming list. The proposal to rename the ships aligns with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture" within the military. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticized the potential name changes as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had previously issued a directive to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell has been exonerated after serving 28 years in prison, becoming the 51st person exonerated in a case linked to disgraced former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was sentenced to 103 years in prison after being framed for murder by Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions. McDowell walked into CPD headquarters in 1997 after being shot, but when he refused to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect, he was framed for an unrelated murder. There was no evidence connecting McDowell to the crime, but Guevara manipulated witnesses into making false identifications; DNA evidence later excluded McDowell as the source, leading to the dismissal of charges.</p>

          <p>Jo-Ann Mort discusses the recent attacks against Jewish people in the U.S. under the guise of caring about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. She highlights incidents in Harrisburg, Washington D.C., and Boulder, Colorado, emphasizing that opposing Israeli policies does not justify harming civilians. Mort calls for a deeper understanding of how some factions of the U.S. left have delegitimized Israel, leading to violence. She advocates for a humanitarian left that embraces peace efforts on both sides and rejects attempts to blame all Palestinians for Hamas's actions. The author also criticizes the cynical use of antisemitism by Donald Trump and his allies to promote their anti-immigrant agenda.</p>

This action comes as top Trump administration officials are urging ICE to increase deportation efforts, aiming to triple the daily number of arrests.

Osment was granted a one-year diversion by a judge in Mono County, California, which will clear his charges if he completes the terms: at least three AA meetings per week and two therapy sessions for the next six months. The actor was arrested in April at Mammoth Mountain ski resort and made disparaging comments to the arresting officer. The district attorney's office initially objected to the diversion request, citing Osment's prior DUI conviction, but the judge ultimately decided in his favor.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative and EU skeptic, has won the Polish presidential election, prompting mixed reactions across Europe. While some leaders congratulated him, others emphasized common values and the need for Poland to uphold the rule of law. Nawrocki's election could impact Poland's EU policy, as he has the power to veto laws and obstruct the government's agenda, particularly on issues like the rule of law, abortion, migration, and climate policy. The EU Parliament is divided on whether Nawrocki will work constructively with Poland's government, and some believe new parliamentary elections are possible due to the clash between Nawrocki's views and the government's agenda.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed concerns, stating that FEMA is taking hurricane season "seriously" and that the remarks were based on jokes. Richardson's comments followed an internal review indicating that FEMA is "not ready" for the 2025 hurricane season; however, a DHS spokesperson denied FEMA is unprepared. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Richardson, while former FEMA official Dan Stoneking argued that the Trump administration is relying on the previous administration's plan for hurricane season.</p>

          <p>California will appeal a judge's decision to dismiss its lawsuit challenging Donald Trump's tariffs, arguing that the case should have been filed in a specialized trade court in New York. The ruling did not address the legality of the tariffs but focused on the proper venue for the lawsuit. California contends that any federal court can hear the case because it raises constitutional objections to Trump's use of tariff powers. The state argues that the law Trump cited to justify the tariffs does not authorize them and cannot force California to litigate in the trade court. The lawsuit challenges Trump's tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners, as well as tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>
