          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced his firm decision to remain an active candidate in the New York City mayoral race, despite his recent primary defeat. He declared his commitment to abide by the results of a proposed September poll, which would require non-leading candidates to withdraw. Cuomo used a video message to express his determination to win, criticizing his presumptive Democratic opponent, Zohran Mamdani, for offering "slick slogans, but no real solutions." He pledged to actively engage with the public, aiming to earn their votes by addressing problems and solutions directly. This article underscores his unwavering political ambition and strategic campaign approach.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, this week as part of its "Crypto Week" agenda. This bipartisan bill, already passed by the Senate, aims to regulate the substantial $238 billion stablecoin market, providing a clearer framework for institutions to issue digital currencies. Proponents argue it will safeguard investors, encourage market competition, and potentially reinforce the U.S. dollar's global standing. However, critics raise concerns about potential centralization and corruption. The article highlights the significant legislative push to formalize digital asset regulation.

          <p>Jose Morales received a 65-year prison sentence for the 2019 beating death of his girlfriend, Christine Holloway, in Ansonia, Connecticut. Their 14-month-old daughter, Vanessa, disappeared concurrently and remains missing, with Morales having been a suspect though never charged in her disappearance. During his trial, Morales falsely claimed intruders killed Holloway and kidnapped Vanessa, despite admitting to cleaning the blood-soaked crime scene and disposing of evidence. The judge condemned the crime as vicious, emphasizing Morales's careless indifference to human life and the necessity of his removal from society for a substantial period.</p>

          <p>Democratic officials from 24 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to restore access to over $6 billion in frozen federal education funding. The funds, intended for vital programs like after-school initiatives, teacher training, and support for English language learners, were abruptly halted by the Education Department for a review aligned with presidential priorities. States argue this decision has caused "chaos" in their planning for the upcoming academic year, with California alone facing a nearly $1 billion deficit. This legal challenge underscores a significant dispute over federal education policy and state autonomy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new strategy to pressure Russia, threatening 100% tariffs on countries trading with Moscow if a peace deal for the Ukraine war isn't reached within 50 days. Speaking with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump also confirmed an agreement to sell weapons to NATO nations, who will then supply Ukraine, with European allies covering the costs. This move signals a shift in the administration's approach, driven by growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions. The initiative aims to leverage economic and military pressure to bring the conflict to a resolution.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge's order that temporarily restricted "roving patrols" by immigration agents across seven Southern California counties. The Department of Justice argues that the injunction causes "irreparable harm" by impeding federal immigration law enforcement and infringing on the President's Article II authority. Civil rights groups, who initiated the lawsuit, maintain that the judge's ruling correctly upheld Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections, prohibiting racial profiling and ensuring due process. This appeal escalates the intense legal battle surrounding the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>Nearly one-third of major U.S. housing markets are now experiencing annual home price declines, marking the slowest growth rate in two years, according to ICE data. This cooling trend is attributed to a confluence of factors including overinflated prices, persistently high mortgage rates, rising housing supply, and falling buyer demand. While the Northeast and Midwest continue to see price gains, softening is evident in the South and West, with notable declines in areas like Cape Coral, Florida, and Austin, Texas. The article highlights a dynamic tension in the market, where increasing inventory aids affordability but falling prices may deter sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Search operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 flash flooding in Texas's Kerr County have been temporarily suspended due to a renewed and severe flood threat. Officials ordered volunteer crews to evacuate river areas as heavy rains were forecast to cause the San Saba River to rise significantly, surpassing previous levels, and the Guadalupe River at Hunt remained under an extended flood warning. The initial flooding tragically killed at least 132 people, with approximately 160 still missing, including dozens from a summer camp.

          <p>The "age 75 rule" for annuities, a common belief suggesting it's best to purchase them at 75 for higher payouts, is more myth than financial standard. While payouts do increase with age due to shorter life expectancy, waiting too long can mean missing earlier income needs, increasing longevity risk, or facing limited options due to health changes. The article emphasizes that the optimal time to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement goals, existing income sources, risk tolerance, and health expectations, rather than an arbitrary age.
