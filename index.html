          <h2>UK Met Office Warns Extreme Weather Events are Becoming the New Standard</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 19:09:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has released its "State of the UK Climate" report, warning that extreme weather is the country's new normal due to climate change. The report highlights that the UK is experiencing more frequent heat and rainfall records, leading to a "notably different" climate than just decades ago. Key findings from 2024 show record-breaking warm months and winters, increased winter rainfall, and a faster-than-average rise in sea levels. These changes are impacting the natural world, affecting species and increasing risks like flooding, underscoring the urgent need for adaptation.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the UK from September 17-19, hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The visit is strategically scheduled when the House of Commons is in recess for party conferences, which avoids the possibility of a controversial address to Parliament. This move is seen as a diplomatic success for the White House, making Trump the first elected leader in modern history to receive two state visits. The timing averts potential political friction while still allowing for the ceremonial aspects of the visit.</p>

          <p>A "60 Minutes" feature highlights the story of Rob Vanderslice, a renowned lowrider artist from Española, New Mexico, known for his intricate vehicle paint jobs. The article details his personal journey, from being deeply involved in gang culture and drug addiction to achieving over 13 years of sobriety. Vanderslice now uses his artistic talent to mentor young people in his community, teaching them to build and paint lowrider bicycles as a way to keep them out of trouble. His personal car, painted to represent his transition "out of the darkness, into the light," symbolizes his transformation and commitment to positive change.</p>

          <p>Lowrider culture in northern New Mexico is undergoing a significant transformation, shedding its historical association with gangs and crime to become a celebrated art form and a force for community good. The article explores how lowriders, once seen as menacing, are now embraced as a vital part of the region's heritage, with events like "Lowrider Day" in Santa Fe marking a cultural shift. The community, led by figures like Arthur "Low Low" Medina, now uses the cars' appeal to organize charitable drives and mentor at-risk youth.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated the move is necessary to reduce a massive overall trade deficit that poses a risk in a national emergency. Critics questioned the justification, particularly since the President's letter to Brazil mentioned the criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro. The administration maintains that a comprehensive tariff strategy is essential to achieve its economic objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Daniel Amen, a psychiatrist and brain imaging specialist, warns that sacrificing sleep to watch television can have detrimental effects on brain health. He explains that during sleep, the brain cleanses itself, and cutting this process short impairs memory, focus, and energy the following day. This lack of proper rest can lead to poor decision-making. The article also notes that exposure to blue light from screens before bed can disrupt melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Dr. Amen advises prioritizing sleep and using blue-light blockers to maintain cognitive function and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>The search for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods in Texas was paused as another round of heavy rain hit the region, prompting new flood warnings. The initial flooding along the Guadalupe River killed at least 129 people, with over 160 still potentially missing in Kerr County. Authorities went door-to-door in some areas to issue new evacuation warnings as waterways were expected to surge again. The ongoing severe weather is complicating recovery efforts and has led to additional high-water rescues in other parts of the state, highlighting the persistent danger facing the flood-ravaged communities.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his R&B roots in a rawer and more improvisational style than previous projects. The album reflects a tumultuous period for the artist, featuring murky production, demo-like tracks, and lyrics that frankly address the pressures of his life and marriage. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee and Dijon, Bieber embraces a scrappy, idiosyncratic sound that aligns with modern pop trends. The review describes the 21-track LP as shaggy, disarming, and often beautiful, arguing it's his most authentic and instinctual work to date.</p>

          <p>Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have launched a major new offensive on el-Fasher, the last army-controlled city in the Darfur region, which is described as a "death trap" for civilians. The paramilitary group reportedly stormed a cattle market and a prison during a seven-hour battle, though the army claims to have pushed them back. The attack exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis, with residents facing starvation, a lack of medicine, and constant shelling. The UN has called the situation the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with millions displaced and famine looming.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense spending, citing unprecedented threats to freedom and peace in Europe. In his traditional Bastille Day speech, Macron stated that the annual defense budget will reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal originally set for 2030. This represents a doubling of the budget since he took office in 2017. He attributed the need for a more powerful military to dangers posed by Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and growing global uncertainty, emphasizing that "to be free... we must be feared."</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, the BBC has confirmed. The hospital has seen a surge in "seriously unwell" children admitted with the highly contagious virus, treating 17 cases since June. While the hospital did not comment on the individual case, the death underscores the dangers of the disease amid falling vaccination rates. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to a decline in the uptake of the MMR vaccine, with vaccination rates in the region falling below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 in a London hospital after a period of illness. A polarizing figure, Buhari first led Nigeria as a military dictator in the 1980s, known for a repressive anti-corruption campaign. He later returned to power as a "converted democrat," winning the 2015 presidential election on a platform of security and anti-corruption. However, his presidency from 2015 to 2023 was marked by economic decline, widespread insecurity, and ongoing health problems, leaving behind a complex and fraught legacy.</p>
