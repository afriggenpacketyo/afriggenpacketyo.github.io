          <p>The BBC has identified members of Kenya's security forces who fatally shot anti-tax protesters outside the parliament in Nairobi last June, revealing that the victims were unarmed and posed no threat. The analysis of over 5,000 images traces the fatal shots to specific officers, including one plain-clothes officer who urged colleagues to "kill." Despite public outcry and a parliamentary committee's call for investigation, no report has been issued, and no one has been held accountable for the deaths, which sparked widespread protests against the controversial finance bill.</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturers are pausing production and exploring new markets as they grapple with the impact of increased U.S. tariffs, leading to job losses and business disruptions.
