          <p>A fatal collision occurred on Mother's Day in Los Angeles when a tour bus struck a disabled SUV on Highway 60 West. The SUV caught fire, resulting in the death of the driver, while 32 tour bus passengers were hospitalized with injuries. Witnesses described chaos and panic following the crash, with one passenger recounting being thrown from their seat. The accident led to a temporary closure of the westbound freeway as authorities investigated the incident, withholding the identity of the deceased pending notification of next of kin.</p>

          <p>Following two days of trade negotiations in Geneva, the White House announced a 'trade deal' with China, but Chinese officials characterized the outcome as 'consensus' and 'substantial progress.'

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant technological disruptions and staffing shortages, leading Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to announce a meeting with airline leaders to discuss scaling back flights. The airport has faced radar outages and equipment malfunctions, resulting in major delays and cancellations. Duffy emphasized the need to modernize the country's antiquated air traffic control systems, warning that other U.S. airports could face similar disruptions during the busy summer travel season.

          <p>CVS Caremark will stop covering Zepbound, a popular obesity drug, in favor of Wegovy, despite research showing Zepbound leads to more weight loss. This decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, will force many Americans to switch medications. CVS Caremark claims the move will lower drug prices for employers, while Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, distanced itself from the decision. Patients and doctors express concern over limiting treatment options, with some considering paying out-of-pocket to continue using Zepbound, as similar restrictions have become more common, upsetting patients and disrupting treatments.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S. due to alleged government-sponsored racial discrimination, departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C. President Trump's administration expedited their resettlement, citing a law allowing racially motivated seizures of land owned by White South Africans. This initiative contrasts sharply with the administration's restrictions on most other refugees. The South African government views the resettlement as politically motivated and a challenge to its constitutional democracy, while the U.S. State Department maintains it prioritizes resettlement for Afrikaners facing unjust racial discrimination.</p>

The plane, however, requires security checks before it can be accepted and is intended for the future Trump presidential library. While Qatari officials confirmed the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is under consideration, they disputed reports of it being gifted during Trump's upcoming trip.

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, diverging from a European plan for a cease-fire. European leaders had set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. However, Trump encouraged Ukraine to engage in direct talks hosted by Turkey, a proposal made by President Putin. In response, President Zelensky expressed readiness to attend negotiations in Turkey on Thursday, but reiterated the need for Russia to halt hostilities to allow for diplomacy, leaving it unclear whether his participation hinged on Russia accepting a cease-fire first.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made "substantial progress" on de-escalating the trade war following high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland. This marks the first meeting since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on China in January. While Bessent did not provide specific details, he mentioned that announcements would be made on Monday and that Trump had been updated. The talks have been praised by both sides, with Trump describing them as engendering a "total reset" and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng also praising the "important progress".</p>

          <p>California is grappling with a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges, testing its resilience. Despite being the world's fourth-largest economy, the state faces a $1 billion budget shortfall in Los Angeles, rising homelessness, and potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies. The state is also experiencing an adversarial relationship with the Trump administration, hindering federal assistance. While some leaders remain optimistic about California's ability to overcome these obstacles, others express concern about the state's future amid rising costs and political divisions.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane carrying white South Africans, claiming discrimination in their home country, departed for the United States, welcomed as refugees by the Trump administration. This initiative contrasts sharply with the administration's halt on virtually all other refugee admissions. The Afrikaners, who say they have been denied jobs and targeted by violence due to their race, have been granted expedited entry. The move has drawn criticism, with some calling it a mockery of the refugee system, while others fear it will deepen tensions between South Africa and the United States.</p>
