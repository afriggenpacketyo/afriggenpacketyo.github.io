          <p>JPMorgan Chase has opened its 1,000th new branch since initiating a major expansion plan in 2018, marking the milestone in Charlotte, North Carolina. This growth brings its total to approximately 5,000 branches, the most of any U.S. bank, running counter to the industry trend of branch closures. The bank's strategy involves entering new markets and renovating existing locations to capture more deposits and serve a larger portion of the U.S. population. The expansion aims to add over $160 billion in incremental deposits, with each new branch expected to break even within four years.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy has arrived in Israel to address the severe humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry reports that at least 91 Palestinians were recently killed while seeking aid. The visit aims to facilitate discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding aid delivery and a potential ceasefire, following a breakdown in negotiations. The ongoing conflict, which began with a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 60,000 Palestinian deaths according to Gazan health officials.

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 15:05:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the modern potato evolved from an ancient tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. A study published in the journal Cell explains that the potato's ability to form starch-rich tubers is the result of genetic contributions from two different parent species. An ancient tomato provided a key gene that signals the plant to create tubers, while a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile contributed a gene that helps control their growth. This finding resolves a long-standing puzzle about the potato's origins and demonstrates how interbreeding can spark the evolution of new traits.</p>

The incident occurred in the second half following a foul call against Griner during a rebound attempt. After a brief verbal exchange resulted in the first technical foul, Griner appeared to bump the referee, leading to an immediate second technical and her automatic removal from the game.

McGregor, who has denied the allegations and claimed the encounter was consensual, did not have criminal charges brought against him. The fighter, who has become a far-right political figure in Ireland, faces a separate sexual assault lawsuit in Florida.</p>

          <p>American buyers of European-made yachts are expected to use legal strategies to circumvent new 15% U.S. tariffs on EU goods. The most common method will likely be registering the vessel in a foreign country, such as the Cayman Islands or Malta, which allows the yacht to enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel without being technically imported. While this strategy involves fees, it offers substantial savings on multimillion-dollar yachts, though it is less practical for smaller boats. The tariffs could also potentially boost demand for U.S.-built yachts and pre-owned vessels already registered in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key consumer protection for federally-backed reverse mortgages, known as the "95% rule," offers a significant benefit to heirs who wish to keep a family home. This rule stipulates that if the loan balance exceeds the home's market value, heirs can satisfy the debt by paying 95% of the property's current appraised value, rather than the full amount owed. This prevents them from having to pay more than the home is worth, with the FHA's mortgage insurance covering the remaining loss. The provision provides peace of mind for senior homeowners and a predictable, more manageable path for heirs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma more than tripled in value during their New York Stock Exchange debut, opening at $85 after being priced at $33 in the initial public offering. The successful IPO, which valued the company at approximately $50 billion, is another strong signal that the market for technology IPOs is reopening after a prolonged slowdown. Figma, which makes web-based collaborative design tools, has over 13 million monthly users and counts major tech companies like Google and Microsoft as clients. The offering raised $1.2 billion, primarily for existing shareholders.</p>

Majd suffered a shattered jaw from an Israeli tank shell explosion and will undergo reconstructive surgery at a London children's hospital. His arrival was facilitated by Project Pure Hope, a volunteer group of medical professionals that funds and organizes treatment for sick and injured Gazan children. The case highlights the devastating impact of the conflict on children and comes as the UK government has promised to evacuate more seriously injured children.</p>

          <p>Shares of chip designer Arm Holdings fell over 13% after the company provided a disappointing earnings forecast for the upcoming quarter. The guidance was amplified by comments from CEO Rene Haas indicating that Arm is considering a major strategic shift toward designing its own processors, a move beyond its traditional business of licensing chip architecture. This disclosure created uncertainty among investors, with analysts noting that developing its own chips would represent a significant and costly leap for the company. The news overshadowed a first-quarter earnings report that was largely in line with Wall Street's expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent and controversial medical regulator, has abruptly departed his high-level roles at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Prasad, who had recently become the agency's chief medical and scientific officer, reportedly resigned after President Trump ordered his removal over objections from top health officials. His brief tenure was marked by conflict, as he angered both pro- and anti-vaccine groups with decisions on COVID vaccines and drew fire from the pharmaceutical industry for his skepticism of a costly new gene therapy. His ouster suggests a triumph of industry and political interests over his rigorous, evidence-based regulatory approach.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting strong quarterly results and raising its full-year guidance, Bristol Myers Squibb saw its shares fall as investor confidence remains shaky. Wall Street is concerned about the growth trajectory of its schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, following a failed clinical trial for a related use, and awaits crucial data from another study. The company also faces a sector-wide overhang from the Trump administration's proposed tariff and drug pricing policies. Due to this uncertainty, the stock is viewed as a potential value trap until there is more clarity on these key issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government has reached a compromise in a dispute over electric vehicle tariffs, granting Chinese automaker BYD a short-term break. BYD will be allowed to import up to $463 million worth of semi-assembled vehicles tariff-free during the first half of 2026 to support the ramp-up of its new local manufacturing plant. However, Brazil also decided to accelerate a planned tariff increase on EV kits, which will now rise to 35% in January 2027, a year and a half earlier than planned. The decision balances BYD's request with pressure from traditional automakers.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, which is believed to be the heaviest ever found in Australia. The new species, Acrophylla alta, can be up to 40 centimeters long and weigh 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was discovered living high in the canopies of the mountainous Wet Tropics region, a habitat that likely contributed to its large size and why it remained undiscovered for so long. The insect was identified as a new species based on its distinctive eggs, and two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum collection.</p>

          <p>With ongoing economic uncertainty, some pre-retirees are considering rolling over their 401(k) funds into an annuity to secure a guaranteed income stream. While high interest rates have made annuity payouts more attractive, this move involves trade-offs, such as limited liquidity and potential fees. A rollover can provide protection against market volatility, but it may also limit growth potential compared to a diversified portfolio. Experts suggest that a partial rollover to cover essential expenses could be a balanced approach, but the decision should be based on individual risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and overall financial goals.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its decision to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data that forecasters rely on, particularly for tracking hurricanes. The Navy had planned to end the data flow as part of a modernization effort but changed course after receiving feedback from government partners and scientists who feared the loss would lead to less accurate storm forecasts. The data, which has been shared for over 40 years, is vital for monitoring storms as they form and for tracking sea ice in polar regions.
