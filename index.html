          <p>A group of nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have publicly criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

In an op-ed, they cited the recent ousting of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, the cancellation of mRNA vaccine research, and the replacement of expert advisory committee members with vaccine skeptics. The former directors, whose service spans both Republican and Democratic administrations, are urging Congress to conduct oversight, warning that the CDC is "on life support."</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break records at the US Open, becoming the oldest man in the open era to reach the quarter-finals of all four Grand Slams in a single year. Despite his impressive run and spectacular serving, questions remain about his physical durability over the course of the demanding tournament. Throughout his matches, Djokovic has required medical attention for various physical issues, including his neck, shoulder, and back. While he remains a formidable opponent, his ability to withstand the physical strain is a significant concern.</p>

          <p>Thousands of union members across the country participated in Labor Day rallies, with many speakers directing their criticism at President Donald Trump and his administration. At a major event in Wilmington, California, participants argued that Trump's policies weaken unions, harm workers, and favor corporations, linking his actions to immigration raids and the undermining of worker protections. In contrast, the White House issued a proclamation stating the administration is "putting American Workers first." The rallies highlighted growing tensions over trade tariffs and collective bargaining rights for federal workers.</p>

The event commemorates the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II and is seen as a significant display of military and political alliance between the three nations amid global tensions. Kim's journey in the "moving fortress" is expected to take around 20 hours, reflecting a tradition of rail travel for North Korea's leaders.

          <p>Despite President Trump's threats to punish Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine, his administration has refrained from implementing severe new sanctions. Analysts suggest this hesitation stems from two key strategic factors. First, Trump reportedly still hopes to broker a peace deal, believing that harsh penalties would hinder this goal. Second, there are concerns within Washington that completely isolating Russia would push it further into a strategic alliance with China, potentially strengthening Beijing's access to energy, military technology, and Arctic territories, which they wish to avoid.</p>

          <h2>Review: Dwayne Johnson Delivers a Solid Performance as MMA Champion Mark Kerr in 'The Smashing Machine'</h2>

          <p>The new film "The Smashing Machine," written and directed by Benny Safdie, stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, which triggered a struggle with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance, aided by prosthetics, is described as a solid portrayal of the fighter's vulnerability, particularly in scenes with his girlfriend, played by Emily Blunt. The review suggests the film effectively captures moments of Kerr's emotional breakdown, though it doesn't fully explore its dramatic potential.</p>

          <h2>Trump Demands Pharmaceutical Companies Publicly Justify COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs, stating he wants an answer "NOW" to settle the public debate over their effectiveness. His comments follow a recent FDA decision to limit the new round of vaccines to high-risk individuals and a leadership shakeup at the CDC. Trump referenced his first-term initiative, Operation Warp Speed, and mentioned seeing "extraordinary" information from Pfizer that he believes should be made public. He urged drugmakers to be more transparent to "clear up this MESS" surrounding the vaccines.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 14:29:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has decreased by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year, reflecting the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies. This decline includes both legal residents and those in the country illegally. The slowdown in immigration is affecting sectors heavily reliant on foreign labor, such as agriculture, construction, and service industries. Economists note that immigrants play a key role in alleviating labor shortages, and this trend could impact economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a temporary suspension of new applications for its refugee family reunion program. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the move is intended to align the rules for refugees with those for other migrants, who typically must meet income and accommodation requirements to bring family members to the UK. The government argues the current unconditional route is out of step with other European nations and places a strain on local councils dealing with homelessness. Further reforms to family reunion policies are expected to be introduced later this year.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has reported that a plane carrying its president, Ursula von der Leyen, experienced significant GPS disruption, with Russian interference being the suspected cause. The incident occurred as the aircraft was approaching southern Bulgaria, though it was able to land safely using alternative navigation methods. This event is part of a noticeable increase in GPS jamming incidents reported by airlines, particularly around the Baltic region, since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The EU stated the act reinforces its commitment to bolstering its defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Houthi forces in Yemen have detained at least 11 United Nations personnel in raids on UN offices in Sanaa, escalating a crackdown on international organizations. This action follows a recent Israeli airstrike that killed several high-ranking Houthi officials. The Houthis have a history of targeting aid workers, often accusing them of being part of spy networks, in what experts see as a tactic to consolidate power and gain leverage. Human rights groups report that dozens of UN and NGO staff remain in Houthi detention, highlighting the extreme dangers faced by humanitarian workers.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 800 people and causing widespread devastation in the remote provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar. The quake, which occurred just before midnight on Sunday, destroyed entire villages, leaving residents to dig through rubble for survivors. Rescue efforts are being hampered by the mountainous terrain and blocked roads, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters. Survivors are now facing the elements without shelter, as eyewitnesses describe scenes of shock and despair among the local population.</p>
