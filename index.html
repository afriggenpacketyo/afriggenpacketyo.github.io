          <p>Payday loans, while seemingly a quick fix for financial emergencies, come with high fees and interest rates that can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. A $1,000 payday loan with a $15 fee per $100 borrowed can quickly escalate to $1,150 due in just two weeks, equating to a nearly 400% APR. Rollover fees and the lack of partial payment options can cause the debt to balloon, making it difficult to repay the original amount. Alternatives like debt relief options should be explored to avoid the long-term financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

There have been frequent reports of shootings as Palestinians approach GHF food aid centers in Israeli-controlled areas.
