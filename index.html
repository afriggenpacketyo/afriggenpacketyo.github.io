        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists has uncovered the evolutionary origins of the potato, tracing it back to an ancient hybridization event involving a tomato ancestor. Published in the journal *Cell*, the research used genomic analysis to show that about nine million years ago, a tomato forerunner crossbred with a tuberless potato-like plant. This event was a key driver in the development of the underground tuber, the very trait that has made the potato the third most consumed food crop globally. The findings shed new light on the diversification of this staple food.</p>

          <p>In a Leagues Cup match, Los Angeles FC defeated Pachuca in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw, but the result has likely ended their tournament hopes. LAFC needed an outright win to have a realistic chance of advancing, and the two points gained from the shootout victory leave them in a precarious position. The match was eventful, with both teams receiving a red card after VAR reviews. Despite a better performance in the second half, LAFC's inability to secure a win in regular time proved costly for their campaign.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's order blocking Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" across much of Southern California. This decision maintains a temporary restraining order that prevents agents from stopping individuals without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally. The court rejected the government's argument that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts.

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a $25 million fundraiser for President Trump just one day after Trump publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies significantly lower drug prices. The president sent letters to 17 drugmakers, including Pfizer, asking for commitments to match lower international prices for Medicaid patients. This juxtaposition highlights the complex relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the White House amid ongoing political pressure to address the high cost of prescription drugs in the United States.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board hearing has shed new light on the fatal midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people. Key findings suggest the helicopter's altimeter may have been inaccurate, a known issue that was not considered alarming. Investigators also heard testimony about pressure on air traffic controllers to manage high traffic volumes and that the FAA had previously been warned by its own staff about the helicopter route's safety risks but did not act.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant seasonal increase in stingray-related injuries, with the daily average jumping from one to about ten. This uptick is attributed to calm, warm ocean waters, which draw stingrays closer to the shore where beachgoers are present. The area near the San Gabriel River, known as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot. Officials are advising visitors to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the buried animals and are providing guidance on how to treat the painful stings with hot water.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages after finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 crash where a car on Autopilot killed a young woman. Jurors determined that Tesla's driver-assistance system shared blame with the distracted driver, who admitted to looking at his phone. The verdict represents a significant legal setback for Tesla, which has consistently argued that drivers must remain attentive. The company called the verdict "wrong" and a setback for automotive safety, vowing to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis from the Trump administration's own Environmental Protection Agency projects that its plan to roll back Biden-era vehicle emission standards will lead to higher gasoline prices for consumers. According to data cited in the report, repealing the policies that encourage fuel efficiency and EV adoption would increase demand for gasoline, thus driving up prices for everyone. The analysis, which also predicts the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035, directly contradicts the administration's public claims of generating consumer savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Greer cited these large swings as a source of concern for the president, although critics, including the commissioner's predecessor, called the firing groundless and a dangerous precedent.

          <p>According to trade experts, President Trump's recent executive order to hike tariffs on imports will likely lead to higher consumer prices and extended uncertainty for businesses. The lack of clear implementation details has created a complex situation, with one expert describing it as a "gigantic Rubik's Cube." With the U.S. effective tariff rate now at its highest in decades, analysis suggests the average American household could face over $2,000 in additional annual costs, affecting goods from clothing and toys to cars and furniture.

His finish, with three bogeys and a double bogey over the final ten holes, was four strokes short of the qualifying position.
