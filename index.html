          <p>A week after US airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, official descriptions of the mission's success remain inconsistent. President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the sites were "obliterated," but subsequent intelligence reports and statements from other officials suggest a more limited impact, potentially setting back Iran's program by only months. The article details the shifting narratives, from claims of total destruction to a focus on achieving a ceasefire with Israel, leaving questions about the actual damage and the fate of Iran's enriched uranium.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the Senate's version of President Trump's major budget bill would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over a decade. The analysis also projects that nearly 12 million Americans could lose their health insurance coverage due to significant cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. These figures, which are higher than the House version's estimates, are complicating Republican efforts to pass the legislation, though some party members dispute the CBO's findings.

Drawing on the history of battle damage assessment (BDA), the author explains that preliminary judgments are often unreliable and a full picture takes time to develop. Given the advanced munitions used, the ideal operational conditions, and the cumulative effect of a preceding 12-day Israeli campaign, the author concludes that President Trump's assessment of significant damage is likely closer to the truth than hasty critiques suggest.</p>

The law was passed over concerns that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, could share US user data with the Chinese government. (not investment advice)</p>
