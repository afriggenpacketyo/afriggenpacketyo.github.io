          <p>Warren Buffett announced he will ask Berkshire Hathaway's board to appoint Greg Abel as CEO at the end of the year, marking the end of an era for the company. Buffett, 94, made the announcement at the annual shareholder meeting, surprising many, including Abel himself. Buffett will remain involved, but Abel, currently vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will have the final say on operations and capital deployment. Berkshire Hathaway, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate, just reached a new peak in share value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Democratic Party in California is grappling with the question of whether their leaders are too old, as some members propose a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders. This discussion was initiated by San Francisco Democrats and will be considered at the statewide party convention. The proposal comes after concerns about leaders like Senator Dianne Feinstein, who remained in office despite health issues, and President Joseph R. Biden, whose age has raised questions about his ability to lead. The idea faces opposition, with some arguing it is ageist and discriminatory against experienced individuals.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located on a volcano in Hawaii, has captured a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this instrument will improve the prediction of potentially damaging solar storms that can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) described sunspots as areas of intense magnetic activity that can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The VTF is considered a technological achievement that promises to help mitigate damage from geomagnetic disturbances.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that President Trump offered to send U.S. troops into Mexico to fight drug cartels, an offer she rejected to uphold national sovereignty. Trump's administration has increased CIA surveillance drone flights over Mexico, designated drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups, and floated the possibility of deploying troops. Sheinbaum has tried to appease Trump to avoid potential tariffs while also defending Mexico's sovereignty, sending troops to the northern border and transferring suspected cartel members to the U.S. The situation has stirred nationalism in Mexico, with calls to boycott American products.</p>

Swarthmore SJP claimed the suspended students were banned from campus without due process, and that the college was exploiting the vulnerabilities of student protesters on the basis of racialized discrimination.

          <p>Residents of Oakdale, California, have shifted away from traditional media sources, relying on a mix of online platforms and influencers for news, leading to uncertainty about what information to trust. Facebook groups have replaced local newspapers, but have also become breeding grounds for conspiracy theories and political debates. A militia incident in 2020, fueled by a false rumor spread on Facebook, highlighted the dangers of misinformation. While efforts to moderate these groups have been made, they have also led to the creation of unfiltered spinoff groups.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist discusses the under-advertised side effects of antidepressants, including sexual side effects, manic episodes, and severe withdrawal symptoms. While acknowledging the transformative benefits of antidepressants for some patients, the article points out the lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off these medications. With over 30 million people taking antidepressants, even relatively rare complications can affect thousands. The author urges the medical community to engage seriously with patients' concerns and prioritize research into medication safety.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is experiencing a decrease in consumer sentiment, leading to changes in customer behavior. Owner Stanley Kallivrousis notes that people are less jolly and are sharing meals, avoiding leftovers, and opting for cheaper options like soup or English muffins instead of full breakfasts. With fewer customers, expansion plans have been paused, and staff retention has become difficult, as some cooks are now driving for Uber.

          <p>A Doctors Without Borders (MSF) facility in South Sudan was targeted in an aerial bombing, resulting in the deaths of at least seven people, including a 9-month-old child. The attack caused significant damage to the hospital's pharmacy, destroying all medical supplies, and wounded at least 25 people. The MSF head of mission condemned the attack as a clear violation of international humanitarian law. The hospital is the only source of medical care for 40,000 residents in the remote area.</p>
