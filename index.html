        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite pledges to halt fossil fuel funding, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly LNG, investing $93 billion between 2013 and 2024. This contradicts its leadership in the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which promotes cooperation on net-zero emissions. While Japan deems LNG a transitional fuel, studies suggest it involves significantly more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered. Critics argue Japan's approach involves greenwashing through loopholes allowing investments in LNG projects deemed 'abated' with technologies like carbon capture, potentially hindering Southeast Asia's transition to renewable energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert proposes a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting," which emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissal, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a stress signal rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to manage their own reactions, and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. The article outlines practical steps for parents to implement this style, including self-reflection, empathetic boundary setting, and preventing shame.</p>
