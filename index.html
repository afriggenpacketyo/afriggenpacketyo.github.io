          <p>Bitcoin's price saw a decline over the weekend, falling below $78,000, as investors reacted to increased financial market volatility stemming from President Trump's implementation of global tariffs. The cryptocurrency, often viewed as a leading indicator of market sentiment, had previously defied a broader market downturn, but ultimately succumbed to selling pressure. Other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana's token experienced even steeper losses, triggering a wave of liquidations for traders who had bet on Bitcoin's price increasing.

          <p>A federal judge has strongly criticized the U.S. government's deportation of a Maryland resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to a dangerous prison in El Salvador, labeling the action as "wholly lawless." Judge Paula Xinis emphasized the lack of evidence supporting allegations of Abrego Garcia's gang affiliation and highlighted a previous ruling that barred his deportation to El Salvador due to potential persecution. The Justice Department has suspended an attorney who conceded the deportation was a mistake, while the White House maintains Abrego Garcia's gang ties despite lacking evidence. This case raises concerns about due process and the rights of immigrants facing deportation.</p>

          <p>A second child in western Texas has died from measles as the outbreak continues to escalate, with over 600 cases reported nationwide this year. The unvaccinated child's death underscores the critical importance of vaccination, according to health officials. US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, despite his past vaccine skepticism, visited Texas and emphasized the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine in preventing the spread of the virus. The outbreak, largely affecting unvaccinated communities, has prompted calls for stronger messaging to encourage vaccination and prevent further deaths.</p>

          <p>The Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office established during the Civil Rights Movement to mediate racial and ethnic tensions, is reportedly slated for closure by the Trump administration. This decision has sparked concern among former leaders and civil rights advocates who fear it could exacerbate disputes between law enforcement and minority communities. The agency, known for its confidential and non-law enforcement approach, has played a crucial role in preventing unrest and fostering reconciliation in cities across the nation. Critics argue that reassigning its staff to prosecutor's offices could undermine its effectiveness due to perceived bias.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Anna Paulina Luna have reached a deal to address proxy voting for new parents, ending a period of legislative gridlock in the House. The agreement introduces "vote pairing," allowing an absent member to coordinate with a present member voting on the opposite side to offset their absence. This compromise allows new parents to participate in votes without physically being present, though their votes won't be officially recorded. Luna has agreed not to pursue her bipartisan discharge petition for remote voting in light of this arrangement.</p>

          <p>Newly qualified doctors in the UK are facing uncertainty as they are informed of their job locations with very little notice, leading to logistical challenges and frustration. This issue stems from a new system of allocating foundation jobs, which prioritizes random assignment over merit, and an increase in medical school places without a corresponding increase in available positions. The British Medical Association has criticized the government's lack of planning and warns that this situation could lead to doctors seeking employment abroad.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is appealing a U.S. Department of Agriculture decision to terminate funding for the state's Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Program. Newsom calls the move "irrational and malicious," arguing that it will harm both farmers and families relying on food banks. The LFPA program supports local and socially disadvantaged farmers by purchasing their produce for food banks. The program's elimination coincides with rising food insecurity and inflation, exacerbating challenges for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, amid growing concerns that President Trump's global tariffs will trigger a recession.
