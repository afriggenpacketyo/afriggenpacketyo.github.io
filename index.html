            <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn following President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply as investors grappled with ongoing tariff uncertainty and awaited earnings reports from major tech companies. Trump's pressure on Powell to cut interest rates has fueled concerns about the White House potentially defying norms and seeking to replace the central bank chief. The market's instability reflects investor anxiety over potential economic impacts from tariffs and the future of Fed policy. Optimism score: 30 (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rep. Don Bacon expressed disapproval of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth allegedly sharing sensitive military information in a Signal group chat. Bacon stated that if the reports are accurate, it is unacceptable, although he wouldn't explicitly call for Hegseth's firing. The allegations involve Hegseth sharing information about a mission in Yemen targeting the Houthis, prompting denials from the White House and Hegseth himself. The Trump administration defends Hegseth, dismissing the reports as "fake news" and praising his leadership at the Pentagon. This situation raises concerns about the handling of classified information and potential security risks.</p>

            <p>The Trump-Vance inaugural committee raised a staggering $240 million for President Trump's second presidential inaugural, surpassing the $107 million raised for his first. The FEC filing reveals donations from various sources, including the cryptocurrency industry and corporate leaders. Pilgrim's Pride Corporation was the largest donor, contributing $5 million, followed closely by crypto company Ripple, which donated $4.9 million.

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating debt into a lower-rate loan can be an effective way to get ahead for many people. However, the effectiveness depends on credit profile; those with good to excellent credit may qualify for the lowest consolidation loan rates. Before pursuing consolidation, assess your financial situation, understand the scope of your debt, check your credit score, and compare loan offers. Debt consolidation isn't a universal solution, and those with poor credit or unstable income may find better results working with credit counseling services. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's cost-cutting measures have led to the layoffs of 130 federal mediators, effectively dismantling the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. This has raised concerns among unions and employers about who will help resolve labor conflicts. The mediators play a vital role in settling disputes and avoiding labor unrest, providing services at little to no cost. The layoffs have disrupted negotiations and fueled a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the closure of the agency defies Congress' constitutional powers.</p>

            <p>DHL will temporarily stop shipping packages over $800 in value to U.S. consumers due to new, more stringent U.S. customs rules. The carrier cited the 10% tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, which have led to increased scrutiny and shipping backlogs. The new policy applies to packages sent from any foreign country to U.S. consumers, while business-to-business shipments over $800 will continue but may face delays. This change is part of President Trump's effort to overhaul global trade policy and close a loophole known as the de minimis exemption.</p>

            <p>The UN is warning that Asian crime networks behind the multi-billion-dollar cyberscam industry are expanding their operations globally.

The UNODC reports that these operations are expanding to South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and some Pacific islands.

            <p>Google is arguing that the U.S. needs the company in its full form to compete with China and uphold national security. The DOJ has called for Google to divest its Chrome browser unit and open its search data to rivals. Google contends that this proposal would hinder AI development and give a government committee control over product design, which would hold back American innovation. The company is facing antitrust scrutiny amidst a broader landscape of enforcement actions against major tech companies.</p>

The spacecraft was launched in 2021 to study the unexplored Trojan asteroids out near Jupiter, with eight Trojan flybys planned through 2033.</p>
