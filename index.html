          <p>NBA star LeBron James has addressed rumors about his future after he was seen practicing at the facility of his former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. James, who recently exercised his player option for the 2025-26 season, clarified that the practice session was not indicative of a potential team change. He explained on social media that he still lives in the area during the offseason and has trained at that same facility every summer since it was built, telling speculators they were simply bored.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that occurred over the July 4th holiday. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night, leading to a catastrophic situation while many residents were asleep. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly admitted the county lacks a river warning system and that they had no reason to believe the flood would be as severe as it was, despite a flood watch being in effect.</p>

In a focus group conducted by the BBC, participants from Kent constituencies cited a lack of progress on key promises, particularly concerning immigration, and felt the government had not been transparent about its plans. While some voters were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of turning the country around in a year, others felt lied to.

          <p>Ukraine's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has warned that Russia may be preparing for a new offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. After visiting units in the area, Syrskyi noted that Russia appears to be looking to press its advantage in troop numbers. This warning comes as Russian forces have been making slow but steady gains along the front lines this summer, including establishing a small foothold in the neighboring Sumy region. Ukraine is focusing on tactical and technological solutions to counter the potential advance.</p>

          <p>After being banned for over 100 years due to pollution, swimming has officially returned to the Seine River in Paris. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, with officials confirming the water now meets safety standards on most days. On Saturday, Parisians eagerly took to designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower, enjoying a dip in the iconic waterway. The move, celebrated by city officials and residents, marks the fulfillment of a long-held dream to restore the river for public recreation.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University, scientists at the Chapple Big Fish Lab are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while studying their vital role in marine ecosystems. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team researches hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay. By examining the contents of a shark's stomach, a process that involves inducing the shark to regurgitate, researchers can assess the animal's health, which serves as an indicator for the overall health of the ocean. The lab's work aims to generate support for the conservation of these often-misunderstood creatures.</p>

          <p>Following his public dispute with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea for a new political party. The billionaire suggested the "America Party" could strategically focus on a small number of key Senate and House races to gain influence. Given the narrow margins in Congress, Musk believes winning just a few seats would be enough to act as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. He also posted a poll on his social media platform, X, where a majority of respondents supported the idea of a new party.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a new large-scale tourist resort on its eastern coast, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic lockdowns. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features hundreds of buildings, including high-rise hotels and villas, designed to accommodate thousands of guests. Despite the goal of boosting its sanctions-hit economy through tourism, the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors. The first international tourists to the resort are expected to be from Russia, reflecting the deepening ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building has collapsed in southern Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 people, with search and rescue operations ongoing. The collapse occurred on Friday, and rescuers have been working with heavy machinery to pull bodies from the rubble and search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards and a lack of regulation enforcement often lead to unsafe buildings being erected with substandard materials.</p>

          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital argues that new work requirements for Medicaid will cause millions of Americans to lose health insurance, disproportionately harming the most vulnerable. The article explains that while many beneficiaries are already working or should qualify for exemptions, bureaucratic hurdles like lack of a fixed address, phone, or internet access will make it nearly impossible for them to prove their status. The author contends that these administrative barriers, or "time tax," are engineered to cut costs by disenfranchising people from care they are entitled to.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a rush of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After that, any prolonged feeling of anger is a choice made by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat suggests allowing yourself that minute and a half to feel the emotion, and then consciously choosing to move on, a practice he believes can lead to a more fulfilled life.</p>
