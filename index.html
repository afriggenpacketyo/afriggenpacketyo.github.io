        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge found the policy arbitrary and lacking specificity, noting Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal transportation funds. The decision prevents the government from enforcing the new immigration rules while the lawsuit proceeds through court.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge in rice prices coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023. The Bank of Japan held rates steady at 0.5% after its recent monetary policy meeting but indicated future rate increases are possible if underlying inflation approaches 2%. Rising geopolitical tensions and their impact on energy prices could further influence inflation trends in Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge has denied Blake Lively's motion to keep her text messages with Taylor Swift confidential in her legal battle against Justin Baldoni. Baldoni's team requested the texts, arguing they are relevant to Lively's harassment and retaliation claims. The judge stated that the messages could contain information that proves or disproves Lively's claims, given that Lively represented that Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the working environment on the film. Lively's team claims Baldoni's team is attempting to exploit Swift's popularity.</p>
