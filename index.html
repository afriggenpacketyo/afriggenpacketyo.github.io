          <h2>UK Hospitals Report Record Requests for Striking Doctors Amid Safety Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 12:01:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) reports that UK hospitals made a record number of requests for resident doctors to return to work during a recent five-day strike over pay. The union claims some requests were inappropriate, while NHS England argues that delays or refusals by the BMA risk patient safety. This tension arises from an NHS directive to maintain elective care during the walkout, a departure from previous strike protocols. The dispute centers on the BMA's demand for a 29% pay restoration, with talks having stalled.</p>

          <p>At 92, Cameroonian President Paul Biya is seeking an eighth term, extending his 43-year rule amidst widespread poverty and corruption. Analysts attribute his longevity to a system where he skillfully plays competitors against each other and maintains a fragmented military structure, making a coup unlikely. Despite his frequent absences and the country's economic struggles, the opposition remains divided and unable to form a united front. Some experts suggest real power now lies with a small circle around Biya, who remains a symbol of unity for the ruling party, preserving its members' privileges.</p>

          <p>Local restoration artist Sheila Lehman is meticulously repairing the iconic, seven-foot-tall Bob's Big Boy statues at the oldest remaining location in Burbank, California. Working by hand, she has refurbished the figures, which had suffered significant damage, including a smashed head on the rooftop statue. Lehman, who has personal memories of the restaurant from her youth, began her restoration career by fixing a statue for her church. She now brings her passion to family heirlooms sent from across the country, finding joy in preserving cherished pieces of history.</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Scotland, Donald Trump praised UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for his government's efforts to stop migrant boats crossing the English Channel, calling it a "fantastic thing." Trump reiterated his view that countries "don't send their best" and emphasized the importance of a strong stance on illegal immigration for national security. The discussion occurred as Starmer's government faces pressure over a 50% increase in small boat crossings compared to last year. Starmer highlighted that his administration has removed approximately 35,000 people from the UK since taking office.</p>

          <p>The first trailer for "Avatar: Fire and Ash," the third film in the series, has been released, introducing a new volcanic Na'vi tribe known as the Ash People. Led by the fierce Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, this clan appears to be an adversary to Jake Sully and his family, representing a darker side of the Na'vi. Director James Cameron has hinted that the film will move beyond a simple "humans bad, Na'vi good" paradigm to explore more complex themes. The film also teases another new clan, the nomadic Wind Traders, and is set for release on December 19.</p>

          <p>A study by Swiss researchers found that the human immune system can be activated simply by viewing images of sick people. Using virtual reality, participants were shown avatars, some of which appeared to have rashes or coughs. Brain monitoring and subsequent blood tests revealed that viewing the sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered an immune response, specifically increasing the activity of innate lymphoid cells. Researchers suggest this finding could open therapeutic opportunities, such as using VR to modulate immunity for allergies or to boost vaccine effectiveness.</p>

          <p>This article from the CNBC Investing Club details a decision to sell a portion of its holdings in the industrial company Eaton. The rationale is to lock in profits after the stock reached a new high, partly in reaction to the new EU-US trade deal. The analysis suggests the market's reaction to Eaton's role in LNG applications may be overblown. The cash raised from the sale will be used to invest in other industrial stocks, like Honeywell and Dover, which are seen as having more room to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

The analysis suggests that while modern forwards possess a more complete skill set than their predecessors, the specific need for a clinical goalscorer has become fashionable again.

The authors argue that the "suburban frontier is closing" as incumbent residents in desirable suburbs use regulations to block new development and density.
