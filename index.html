            <h2>China's Exports Surge Amid Trade War Frontloading</h2>

            <p>China experienced an unexpected surge in exports in March, jumping over 12%, driven by businesses accelerating shipments to the U.S. to avoid impending tariffs. However, imports declined due to weak domestic demand. Experts predict that exports will likely weaken in the coming months as U.S. tariffs increase, potentially leading to supply chain disruptions and inflation in the U.S. China has retaliated with its own tariffs on select American goods, and the leadership aims for a 5% annual growth target amid these trade tensions.

            <p>Peruvian author and Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa has passed away at the age of 89 in Lima, surrounded by his family. Known for his impactful works exploring themes of violence, societal disruption, and authoritarian politics in Latin America, Llosa was a giant of Latin American literature. He sought the presidency of Peru in 1990 and later reflected that literature extends beyond politics, encompassing all dimensions of life. His novels sparked anger in the country's military elite at the time, and earned him criticism from some of Peru's top generals.</p>
