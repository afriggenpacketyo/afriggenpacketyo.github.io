          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound, a more effective weight loss drug, in favor of Wegovy highlights the impact of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) on patient access to medication. Despite research indicating Zepbound's superiority in weight loss, Caremark cited cost-saving measures for employers as the reason for the change, a decision that affects thousands of Americans. Patients express frustration over being forced to switch medications, while doctors prefer Zepbound for its efficacy. This article underscores the growing trend of insurance denials driven by secret deals between drugmakers and PBMs, raising concerns about patient choice and treatment effectiveness.</p>

          <p>California faces a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges, testing its resilience. Despite being the fourth-largest economy globally and experiencing population growth, the state is threatened by wildfires, immigration crackdowns, and a housing shortage leading to an aging population. Los Angeles struggles with a budget shortfall exacerbated by rebuilding efforts and Olympic preparations, while homelessness plagues major cities. The state's adversarial relationship with the federal government under President Trump further complicates matters, as federal assistance is uncertain due to policy disagreements. Optimism remains among some leaders, citing California's history of overcoming crises, but concerns persist about the state's future amid rising costs and political divisions.</p>

          <p>A US-funded charter plane transported white South Africans, granted refugee status under a Trump administration program, from Johannesburg to the United States. The program, supported by Trump and Elon Musk, addresses claimed persecution of white South Africans, despite their continued privilege. This initiative references a land expropriation law, which Trump believes will lead to the confiscation of white-owned farms, and has received 8,000 inquiries for resettlement. This expedited pathway for Afrikaners contrasts with the slowed admissions for other refugees under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump is prioritizing securing new investments from Gulf states, particularly sovereign wealth funds, to bolster the US economy. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia is expected to yield agreements integrating the Saudi and US economies, including arms purchases and joint ventures. While the UAE has committed substantial long-term investments, analysts caution against overstating short-term impacts. Discussions will also focus on artificial intelligence, with the Gulf seeking access to US technology, and Saudi Arabia aiming to attract American investment into its Vision 2030 program. This article highlights the economic significance of the Gulf region to Trump's agenda amidst disrupted global trade and a recent fall in US economic output.</p>

President Trump expressed optimism and a willingness to lower tariffs, while Chinese officials seek the removal of "unilateral" tariffs first. These talks are crucial for stabilizing global markets and businesses affected by the U.S.-China trade standoff. The article notes that the outcome of the Geneva meeting remains uncertain.</p>

Mexico's Agriculture Secretary expressed disagreement with the measure but anticipates a swift resolution. This suspension underscores the importance of safeguarding animal health and the nation's food supply, as screwworm infestations can cause severe damage and fatalities in warm-blooded animals, including humans.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned after a 12-year legal battle. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea following a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership. The statue will be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple. The return ends a dispute that had contributed to friction between Japan and South Korea.</p>

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a 2018 bike accident, has regained the ability to walk using a "digital bridge" technology that wirelessly connects her brain to a spinal cord stimulator. This innovative technology, developed by Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch and French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine, allows her to move her legs through her thoughts. After training with the digital bridge, she took her first steps, describing it as gaining a superpower.
