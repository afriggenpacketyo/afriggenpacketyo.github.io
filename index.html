          <p>Lithium Americas' stock surged over 35% after U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the government's plan to take a 5% equity stake in the company and its Thacker Pass project. This move is part of a broader White House strategy to secure critical mineral supply chains, particularly lithium, essential for U.S. interests. The Nevada-based Thacker Pass is anticipated to become a major North American lithium source, with operations starting in late 2027. The government's investment aims to ensure the mine's financial stability and domestic lithium production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 288, significantly increasing California's authority over workplace disputes and union elections. This legislation empowers the state to intervene when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) fails to act, particularly in cases of retaliation or stalled union certifications. The move directly responds to the Trump administration's alleged weakening of federal labor regulators, with Newsom emphasizing California's commitment to protecting workers' rights. The law aims to ensure workers can unionize and bargain without relying on a "failing federal agency."</p>

          <p>The Taliban has imposed a near-total internet and telecom blackout across Afghanistan, disabling the country's fiber optic network and causing widespread disruption. Citing "morality concerns," this move has grounded flights, frozen banking services, and isolated millions of citizens and businesses. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has urged immediate restoration of services, warning of "significant harm" to the Afghan people and crippling humanitarian operations. This phased campaign by Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada severely restricts communication and access to information for the nation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is hours away from a potential shutdown as funding is set to expire at midnight. This looming crisis stems from a failure of negotiations between President Trump and congressional Democrats, primarily over expiring healthcare subsidies and Medicaid cuts. Democrats are leveraging the shutdown threat to push for these healthcare demands, while Republicans resist. The situation carries broader stakes, with the Trump administration reportedly threatening to fire federal workers rather than just furloughing them, potentially making this shutdown different from previous ones.</p>

          <h2>ACA Subsidies and Immigrant Eligibility Central to Government Shutdown Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 18:33:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key point of contention in the impending government shutdown is the debate over Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits and their eligibility for certain immigrants. Republicans accuse Democrats of seeking healthcare for "illegal immigrants," a claim Democrats deny, stating they aim to restore coverage options for "lawfully present" immigrants removed by a previous Trump tax bill. The expiration of these subsidies at the end of 2025 threatens to significantly increase health insurance premiums for millions of Americans. This ideological divide over healthcare policy is a primary obstacle to a funding resolution.</p>

          <p>A KFF analysis reveals that Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace premiums are projected to more than double in 2026 if enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at the end of 2025. This 114% average increase would see premiums rise from $888 to $1,906 annually for 22 million enrollees. Democrats are pushing to extend these subsidies as part of a federal funding deal, while Republicans prefer separate negotiations. The potential expiration, coupled with changes to tax credit calculations and insurer rate hikes, highlights significant financial implications for millions of Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

Carr stated that networks like Nexstar and Sinclair pulled the show for "business reasons," not due to any implied threat of license revocation. His remarks followed ABC's indefinite pre-emption of Kimmel's show after Carr appeared to pressure broadcasters over Kimmel's comments on Charlie Kirk's death. Despite his denial, the incident drew bipartisan criticism, with one FCC commissioner calling it a "new low of corporate capitulation" that endangered free speech.</p>

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown is expected to have minimal impact on conventional mortgage processing but could cause delays for government-backed loans. Housing experts advise that while private lenders will continue operations, agencies like the FHA, VA, and USDA, which support a significant portion of the mortgage market, may experience processing slowdowns due to furloughs. Specifically, the USDA will halt new direct and guaranteed home loans. Additionally, securing flood insurance in high-risk areas could be complicated, as the FEMA-administered program cannot sell new policies during a lapse in authorization.</p>
