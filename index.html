          <p>Philadelphia police have discovered female remains in a shallow grave behind a school, intensifying the search for 23-year-old Kada Scott, who has been missing for two weeks. The discovery, made in a heavily wooded area following an anonymous tip, awaits formal identification by the medical examiner's office. Authorities had expressed concern due to worrying phone calls Scott received before her disappearance, and Keon King, 21, was previously charged with kidnapping in connection with the case. Scott was last seen leaving work on October 4, and evidence suggests she met with King shortly after. Her family continues to communicate with police, holding onto hope amidst this difficult and ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted former New York Congressman George Santos' more than seven-year prison sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, leading to his immediate release. Trump stated Santos was "horribly mistreated" in prison, enduring solitary confinement for long stretches. This commutation also reportedly waives Santos' obligation to pay restitution to his victims, a detail confirmed by CBS News. The decision has drawn criticism from lawmakers like Congressman Nick LaLota, who argued Santos' crimes warranted a longer sentence and that he should make restitution for defrauding voters and donors.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans across all 50 states participated in "No Kings" protests, demonstrating against what they perceive as the Trump administration's authoritarian tendencies and government overreach. The widespread rallies, a second iteration after similar events in June, highlighted concerns over immigration crackdowns, attacks on free speech, and the deployment of federal agents to cities. Participants, including many families, used creative forms of expression like inflatable costumes to emphasize peaceful resistance and a fierce love for democratic values. Organizers underscored their commitment to non-violence, aiming to empower citizens and counter Republican claims of the protests being "Hate America" rallies.</p>

The statement informed guarantor nations of the Gaza peace agreement about this threat, without providing specific details on the target or timing. This warning follows recent reports and video evidence obtained by CBS News showing armed Hamas fighters executing suspected Palestinian collaborators. The U.S. emphasized that measures would be taken to protect Gaza's people and preserve the integrity of the fragile ceasefire agreement, which saw a recent exchange of hostages and prisoners.</p>

          <p>The Spanish town of Terrassa in Catalonia has temporarily halted black cat adoptions from animal shelters between October 6 and November 10. This preventative measure aims to protect the felines from potential harm or use as props in "sinister rituals" during Halloween, a period when adoption requests for black cats typically increase. While the city council has no record of cruelty towards black cats in Terrassa, the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups. The ban is considered "temporary and exceptional," with normal fostering requests resuming after Halloween.</p>

          <p>A new railway in landlocked Laos has become a crucial conduit for China to secure potassium, a strategic resource vital for agricultural production. This development provides China with unprecedented confidence in trade negotiations with Western nations, particularly the United States.

The "potassium railway" represents a significant shift in global trade dynamics, reducing China's dependence on Western suppliers for this essential commodity.</p>

          <p>A former acting director of ICE, John Sandweg, criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, stating it puts federal agents in a "terrible position" by deploying them to cities for operations they are not trained for. The article highlights viral videos of forceful encounters and the use of tear gas, prompting a federal judge to mandate body cameras for agents in Chicago. Sandweg argues these tactics, which blur the lines between traditional law enforcement and military-style operations, escalate tensions and are inappropriate for urban environments, creating unprecedented confrontations.</p>

          <p>Moldova's Queer Cafe offers a visible and welcoming space for LGBTQ+ individuals in Chisinau, providing community and support despite persistent discrimination and threats. Manager Lorelei Grigorita notes increased tolerance, yet a recent study shows 80% of Moldovans wouldn't want a queer neighbor. With rising pro-Russia political influence framing LGBTQ+ issues as "moral decay," the community faces renewed challenges like banned Pride events and threats of violence. Despite this, activists remain hopeful for legal recognition and greater acceptance, striving for a more diverse and inclusive Moldova.</p>

          <p>Popular food trends, including Dubai chocolate, matcha, and quinoa, are revealing a dark side, with soaring demand leading to significant environmental and social challenges. The pistachio craze, fueled by Dubai chocolate, drains water resources and promotes monocultures in dry climates. Matcha mania causes shortages and price hikes, impacting traditional Japanese tea culture. Quinoa's superfood status led to land degradation and made it unaffordable for local Andean populations, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable consumption practices and diverse crop cultivation to mitigate these global impacts.

          <p>Rangers' interim coach Steven Smith lamented his team's "disappointing" mentality after a 2-2 draw with Dundee United, extending their poor start to the season.

Fans displayed banners criticizing the players, reflecting a decade-long concern about the team's mental fortitude. Repairing this deep-rooted vulnerability poses a significant challenge for whoever becomes the next permanent head coach.</p>
