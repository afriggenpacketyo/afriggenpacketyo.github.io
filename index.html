          <p>Jonathan Joss, the voice actor known for his role as John Redcorn on "King of the Hill," tragically died in San Antonio after being shot by a neighbor during a dispute. Police responded to a shooting report and found Joss, 55, near the roadway; he was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect, Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, 58, was apprehended and charged with murder, with neighbors reporting a history of feuds between the two men, sometimes involving weapons.

          <p>Elon Musk's brain technology startup, Neuralink, has secured $650 million in a new funding round to further develop its brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The funding will be used to bring the technology to more patients and create new devices aimed at enhancing the connection between biological and artificial intelligence. Neuralink's first system, Telepathy, involves inserting 64 threads into the brain to record neural signals, with the initial goal of helping patients with severe paralysis regain independence. Five patients have already been implanted with Neuralink's technology and can control digital devices with their thoughts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting a Venezuelan migrant under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), citing inadequate notice and due process. U.S. District Court Judge John Holcomb ruled that individuals subject to deportation under the AEA must have the opportunity to challenge the move. The ruling came amid a complaint by Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained by ICE, who claims to be a dissident and was arrested based on alleged gang affiliations indicated by tattoos. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling that allowed the administration to proceed with deportations of migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela under the AEA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Senate prepares to consider President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Republicans are divided over its potential impact on the national debt. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by $1.5 trillion, it is projected to add approximately $3.1 trillion to the debt, leading some fiscal conservatives to demand deeper cuts. The White House defends the bill, citing its own analysis that claims $1.6 trillion in savings over ten years. Complicating matters further, any Senate changes must be approved by the House, where the bill narrowly passed, and divisions remain over preserving social safety net programs, with some calling for cuts to programs like Medicaid and Social Security.</p>

          <p>Recent attacks targeting Jewish communities in Boulder, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., are being described as acts of anti-Semitic terror, demonstrating a disturbing "performative intimacy." In Boulder, a suspect used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails against a gathering supporting the release of Israeli hostages, while in D.C., two Israeli embassy staff were killed outside a Jewish museum. Both attackers reportedly shouted pro-Palestinian slogans, revealing a mindset that assigns responsibility for Israeli policies to Jewish people worldwide. The attacks are designed to create a spectacle of vulnerability for all Jewish Americans, and the solution lies in constantly and forcefully delegitimizing these acts without qualification.</p>

          <p>The arrest of an 18-year-old high school student by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Milford, Massachusetts, has triggered significant protests. Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, who entered the U.S. on a student visa, was detained while driving his father's vehicle, even though the agents were seeking his father. The head of ICE defended the agency's actions, stating that Gomes was in the country illegally, while the state's governor expressed outrage. A federal judge issued an emergency order to prevent Gomes's transfer out of Massachusetts.</p>

The drones were reportedly smuggled into Russia inside wooden cabins on lorries and launched remotely. The attack targeted strategic missile-carrying bombers, causing damage and destruction to aircraft at multiple air bases. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the operation took over a year to prepare, and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed the attack cost Russia $7 billion.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to invest billions to prepare the country for potential war, citing increased threats from nations like Russia and China. The plan involves accepting all 62 recommendations from a Strategic Defence Review (SDR), including building new nuclear-powered submarines and munitions factories, as well as embracing technologies like artificial intelligence. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the need for the British Army to become significantly more lethal to address the evolving threat landscape. The review was conducted with the expectation that defence spending would rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027, but there are calls for even greater investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article suggests that opening a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) with $10,000 in June could be a wise financial decision, as interest rate cuts may be issued in July. With the Federal Reserve potentially reducing rates, securing a CD now can protect against market volatility and guarantee a fixed interest rate. Depending on the CD term and interest rate, savers could earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest. This move would provide stability and predictable returns amid economic uncertainty.

This trend is seen across all income brackets in the meals and beverages category.
