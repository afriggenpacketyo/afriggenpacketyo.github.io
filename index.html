          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement with Rudy Giuliani in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit, stemming from his baseless claims of 2020 election rigging. The agreement, which dismisses the 2021 suit, addresses the significant damage caused by Giuliani's allegations to public confidence in U.S. elections and the company's reputation. This development follows similar large settlements Dominion secured from Fox News and Newsmax, reinforcing the legal consequences for disseminating election conspiracy theories. Giuliani continues to face substantial legal and financial challenges, including disbarment and a $148 million judgment, reflecting the broad impact of his post-election activities.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers, supported by the Starbucks Workers United union, rallied in Los Angeles and other cities to pressure the company into restarting stalled contract talks. These protests follow Starbucks' announcement of hundreds of store closures and layoffs, alongside legal actions from employees regarding a new dress code without reimbursement for new clothing. Contract negotiations broke down in December, with the union rejecting a proposal in April and now warning of a potential strike. The union asserts the company has implemented new policies without proper bargaining, while Starbucks maintains the union is to blame for the impasse and that it offers competitive benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four major Scottish crime figures, including Steven Lyons, have been arrested in Dubai, signaling a significant escalation in the 25-year-old feud between the Lyons and Daniel families. These arrests are linked by Police Scotland to drug importation and a recent surge in gang violence across the central belt. The long-standing rivalry, which allegedly originated from a £20,000 cocaine theft in 2001, has involved multiple murders and violent incidents over two generations. Recent events, such as a double murder in Spain and a dispute involving Ross McGill's gang, highlight the global expansion and complex nature of this deep-seated criminal conflict, drawing attention to Dubai as a haven for organized crime.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve has been suspended for one playoff game and fined by the WNBA following her aggressive behavior and critical comments during and after a recent loss to the Phoenix Mercury. Her actions included verbally abusing an official, delaying her exit after ejection, making inappropriate remarks to fans, and lambasting the league's officiating in a post-game press conference. Reeve's ire was particularly drawn by a crucial no-call on a play that resulted in a Lynx player's injury, leading her to describe the officiating as "malpractice." This marks a rare instance of a WNBA coach being suspended for a playoff game, highlighting ongoing concerns about officiating consistency within the league.</p>

          <p>Europe has achieved a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States, positioning them to retain the Ryder Cup with just 2.5 points needed from the final 12 singles matches. This historic advantage represents Europe's largest ever pre-singles lead, achieved through an "imperious" team performance. The event, however, was overshadowed by "thuggish" and personal insults from American galleries directed particularly at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to multiple ejections and a notable decline in Sunday ticket prices. Despite the challenging atmosphere and some on-course altercations, the European team, including key players like Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood, demonstrated remarkable resilience and skill to dominate the sessions.</p>

Gauffeny aims to ensure his identity is known beyond his detainee status, describing him as a humorous, helpful, and devoted father. This personal narrative underscores the profound human tragedy of the incident, which also resulted in one death and another injury among detainees, prompting calls for improved security at such facilities.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler experienced a historic struggle at the Ryder Cup, becoming the first American to lose all four opening sessions, an outcome that belied his recent dominant form. Despite his individual supremacy in stroke-play, Scheffler's performance in the team format revealed vulnerabilities in his putting and an inability to adapt his game when paired with others. This unexpected "flop" contributed to the USA's overwhelming deficit against Europe, underscoring how the unique pressures of the Ryder Cup can challenge even the sport's top players. His detached mindset, usually an asset, raised questions about its suitability for team events.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent unfiltered public statements, including claims about autism and aggressive criticisms of opponents, suggest he feels increasingly invincible. He appears to embrace professional disapproval as a sign of authenticity, leveraging it to frame himself as a convention-challenger. From a memorial service to the United Nations, Trump's combative and inconsistent messaging, such as a U-turn on Ukraine, is recast as strategic genius. His reaction to James Comey's indictment further illustrates this pattern, as he frames it as vindication, solidifying an image of being above normal political, legal, or diplomatic consequences.</p>

He expresses concern about increasing partisanship in the judiciary and society, advocating for more respectful discourse. The article highlights his personal journey on contentious issues, including a reconciliation with Justice Scalia after their disagreement on gay marriage, and his nuanced stance on originalism.</p>

          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging remains a subject of debate among dermatologists and consumers. While some users report benefits like brighter skin and stronger hair, consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth expresses skepticism about collagen's ability to reach skin cells after oral consumption, even in peptide form. Topical collagen creams are deemed ineffective as they don't penetrate the dermis. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, contrasting with independent research that finds no significant effect. Experts emphasize that sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking are far more impactful for skin health.</p>

          <p>Former MP George Galloway and his wife, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, were stopped by counter-terrorism police at Gatwick Airport upon returning from Moscow. The Metropolitan Police confirmed they were questioned under the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act but were not arrested and were allowed to proceed. Galloway's Workers Party of Britain condemned the incident as "politically motivated intimidation," asserting it obstructs freedom of speech and aims to silence opponents of war with Russia and China. This event raises concerns about the use of counter-terrorism powers against political figures and potential implications for civil liberties.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain, which has been severely impacted by a cyber attack halting production since late August. This financial backing, provided through the Export Development Guarantee, aims to protect jobs in the automotive sector and prevent small suppliers from going bankrupt. The cyberattack, claimed by "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters," has cost JLR an estimated £50 million per week, forcing the company to suspend car manufacturing. While welcomed, opposition parties criticized the government for a slow response and called for broader cyber reinsurance schemes. (not investment advice)</p>

He specifically criticized Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for hundreds of thousands of migrants, arguing it would "tear this country apart."
