            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight Moscow time, citing humanitarian considerations. This move has been met with skepticism, especially given Russia's recent intensified attacks. Ukraine's President Zelensky acknowledged the attempted ceasefire but reported continued isolated Russian advances. The Russian military, however, accused Ukraine of violating the truce. Some observers view the truce as a PR move aimed at improving relations with the Trump White House amidst growing impatience from American officials regarding the lack of progress in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>California is facing a massive $5.6 billion unfunded liability due to state employees cashing out unused vacation time, with some retirees receiving payouts exceeding $1 million. The state's generous time-off provisions and failure to enforce vacation balance caps have contributed to this growing problem. The largest payouts can be multiple times an employee's salary, and the state's liability could be a budget-breaker in a recession. The state is exploring options to reduce the liability, including vacation buyback programs and encouraging employees to take time off.</p>

            <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's dismantling of democratic checks and balances has become a point of fascination for political scientists. Over his four consecutive terms, Orban and his allies have taken control of the country's media, civil society, and universities, consolidating power in himself and his Fidesz party. He has targeted the media, exerted pressure on universities, and restricted freedom of assembly. Some observers draw parallels between Orban's tactics and those of President Trump.</p>

            <p>The tradition of making cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, is a cherished Easter custom in Texas and Northern Mexico, connecting generations through love and remembrance. The egg is a symbol of rebirth, linking pre-Christian European traditions to the Easter holiday. The article follows Denise Solis, who continues the tradition passed down from her mother, who died the day before Easter in 2003.

            <p>China has taken a more active role in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, urging Kigali to cease support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw troops from the DRC. This marks a shift from China's usual non-interference policy in African conflicts. The change is driven by China's desire to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries. Despite this shift, China's approach remains measured to balance its interests in the region.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers for shipments worth over $800 due to increased customs red tape following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to multi-day delays. The White House is also set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 from China and Hong Kong by closing a loophole that allowed low-value packages to enter the US without duties. This move is aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain and will impact fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu.</p>
