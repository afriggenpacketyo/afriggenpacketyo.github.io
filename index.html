          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 20:07:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising move, the Trump administration has sided with the Biden administration's earlier request to dismiss a lawsuit aimed at restricting access to mifepristone, an abortion pill. The Justice Department argued that the case, brought by conservative attorneys general, was filed in the wrong venue and lacks legal standing. This decision avoids addressing the merits of the case, potentially buying time for the Trump administration to formulate a strategy on mifepristone. The lawsuit seeks to reverse regulatory changes that expanded access to the pill, which now accounts for nearly two-thirds of pregnancy terminations in the United States.</p>

          <p>All airports in Moscow were temporarily shut down after an overnight drone attack, which Russia attributes to Ukraine. Moscow's mayor reported that at least 19 Ukrainian drones were destroyed before reaching the city, with debris landing on a key highway. This incident follows reports of incursions into Russia's Kursk region and attacks on an electrical substation. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for hitting a drone command unit in the Kursk region, asserting its continued military presence in the area nine months after launching a surprise invasion.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts, agreeing to pay $511 million in penalties. The DOJ said that Credit Suisse committed new crimes and breached its May 2014 plea agreement with the United States. The scheme, which ran from 2010 through 2021, allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations, resulting in a tax loss of over $71 million. The agreement requires Credit Suisse and UBS to fully cooperate with ongoing investigations and disclose information about U.S.-related accounts.</p>

          <p>As violence escalates in Gaza, analysts suggest President Trump has disengaged from the conflict, potentially giving Israel a freer hand. Despite earlier promises to end the war, Mr. Netanyahu has warned of an "intensive" Israeli escalation. While the Biden administration actively managed Israel's Gaza campaign, limiting civilian suffering, Trump's attention has been sporadic, focusing more on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Although Trump has expressed concern for Gazans, his administration's approach is seen as less involved in managing Israel's operations, as his special envoy for the Middle East has also taken on the Iran file and met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia four times to discuss Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Indian industries, particularly textiles, are facing challenges due to cheaper Chinese imports flooding the market, exacerbated by Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.

The Indian government has established a committee to monitor the influx of inexpensive Chinese goods and has imposed taxes on certain steel imports. India's trade deficit with China has surged, underscoring the difficulty in reducing reliance on Chinese goods despite efforts to boost local manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering a $1,000 cash stipend and a flight home to undocumented immigrants who willingly leave the United States, officials said. The policy is part of a broader effort to increase deportations and persuade immigrants to deport themselves, aiming to fulfill campaign promises. The money will be paid after migrants confirm their travel home through a government app. The administration argues this program will save money by avoiding the costs of arrest, detention, and government-chartered flights.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose 100 percent tariffs on movies produced outside the United States has caused confusion and concern in Hollywood. The proposal, which followed a meeting with actor Jon Voight, aims to boost domestic film production. However, industry leaders worry that tariffs could harm the industry, and they call for federal tax credits instead. The plan has raised questions about the types of movies that would be affected and its potential impact on international productions and jobs.</p>
