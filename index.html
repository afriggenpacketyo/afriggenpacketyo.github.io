Jake Mitchell Haro and Rebecca Renee Haro were arrested and face charges of murder and making a false police report, with a $1 million bail set for each. While the child's remains have not been found, authorities presume him dead and are actively searching, having previously conducted extensive searches and reviewed surveillance video.

          <p>China is preparing for the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II, a parade intended to showcase the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) strength and unity. However, the event is shadowed by recent corruption allegations, including the removal of former navy chief of staff Li Hanjun for "serious violations." While some question if this impacts the PLA's war readiness, others argue it demonstrates President Xi Jinping's commitment to building a "capable of winning wars" force. The upcoming parade will reveal new weapons and commanders, offering insights into the military's progress and ongoing challenges.</p>

Brittany Aldean shared on Instagram that she would have preferred to dine there but stated, "yall been actin a fool," referring to the removal of the "Old Timer" character from the brand's new text-only logo. This move sparked strong reactions among fans, with many expressing support for the Aldeans' decision and vowing to also avoid the restaurant chain.

          <p>The Trump administration's drastic cuts to USAID have led to a massive "fire sale" of equipment, including medical supplies, generators, and textbooks, from over 5,000 canceled foreign-aid projects. Normally, such items are redistributed to other projects or local partners, but this year, millions of dollars' worth of goods are being auctioned at a loss or simply abandoned due to lack of guidance. This chaotic closeout has forced some NGOs to illegally redistribute supplies, while others face the destruction of essential aid like food and vaccines. The situation highlights significant waste of taxpayer money and raises national security concerns over who acquires these assets.</p>

          <p>Identity software maker Okta saw its shares rise after reporting fiscal second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon noted that economic conditions were "much better than we thought," leading the company to bump up its fiscal 2026 forecast.

          <p>Authorities in Dallas arrested a 36-year-old man for allegedly making bomb threats outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Bratton Dean Wilkinson reportedly showed security officers a "detonator" on his wrist and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack, prompting a shelter-in-place order. The incident follows other recent threats and assaults against ICE agents, which the agency reports have increased by 1,000% since the beginning of the Trump administration. ICE officials are re-evaluating training to prepare for evolving tactics by protesters, while the U.S. Attorney's Office considers federal charges against Wilkinson.</p>

Cook denies the allegations and plans to sue, setting up a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court and define presidential authority over the central bank. If successful, Trump could appoint a majority of the Fed board, potentially influencing interest rates for short-term political gains, which experts warn could severely damage the long-term US economy by slowing growth and boosting inflation.

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional maps, a development that could potentially lead to Democrats gaining a U.S. House seat. The ruling stems from a 2018 voter-passed proposition aimed at independent redistricting and prohibiting partisan influence. This decision sets up a short window for changes, though appeals may impact the timeline. The ruling is part of a broader national trend of redistricting battles, with Republicans seeking to solidify control in states like Texas and Democrats pushing for favorable changes in California. The outcome in Utah could be crucial given the narrow GOP majority in the House.</p>

The Western media has criticized Trump's interactions with Putin, but European allies suggest their solidarity prevented further concessions. With the Trump administration visibly distancing itself from the conflict, China's strategic position strengthens, contrasting with the US's inability to broker a resolution and Europe's limited agency.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration's lawsuit against 15 Maryland U.S. district court judges, which challenged a standing order preventing immediate removal of migrants disputing their detentions. Judge Thomas Cullen ruled that the administration lacked the legal right to sue and that the judges were immune, criticizing the unprecedented nature of the executive branch suing the judiciary. Cullen suggested the administration should appeal the order through established congressional paths rather than a "confrontational" lawsuit, also noting the administration's repeated attacks on judges who rule against its agenda. This article underscores the separation of powers and judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Emergency crews are battling numerous wildfires across the US West Coast, from California's wine country to central Oregon, with forecasters warning of more potential ignitions. In central California, the Garnet fire has scorched 14 square miles and remains 0% contained, challenged by erratic winds. While Oregon's Flat fire, which destroyed four homes, began to stabilize with moisture, a heat advisory and potential thunderstorms could create new threats. Northern California's Pickett fire, at 15% containment, has so far spared vineyards, but the overall fire season remains active and dangerous, exacerbated by climate change-induced heatwaves and droughts.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has abruptly canceled its Creative Writing Fellowship program, an annual initiative established in 1966 that has supported numerous acclaimed American authors. The program offered $50,000 grants, with applications for the FY 2026 cycle already submitted. Notices sent to applicants cited the NEA's new focus on projects aligned with Trump administration priorities, including HBCUs, Hispanic serving institutions, America's 250th anniversary, houses of worship, and "AI competency." This decision marks a significant shift in federal arts funding and raises concerns about the future of direct support for American fiction, non-fiction, and poetry.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have charged a total of 67 people, aged 21 to 83, for allegedly showing support for the proscribed group Palestine Action in central London. These arrests, made on July 5th or 12th, fall under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act, carrying a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment. Hundreds more have since been arrested for similar displays. Commander Dominic Murphy of the Met's counter-terrorism command dismissed claims that such protests overwhelm police resources. The group, which faces a High Court challenge to its ban, argues the proscription breaches free speech and acts as a gag on legitimate protest.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, a 37-year-old home construction executive and significant Trump donor, is spearheading accusations of mortgage fraud against President Trump's political adversaries from his position as head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Pulte has referred three such claims to the Justice Department, targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, all of whom deny wrongdoing. This unusual use of a regulatory role, typically focused on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, highlights a pattern of weaponizing government agencies. Critics point to the superficial nature of the accusations and the appointment of a "Stop the Steal" supporter to investigate these cases.</p>

          <p>A Kansas resident is suing Southwest Airlines and another passenger following a viral hair-pulling incident aboard a flight, blaming the airline's "free-for-all" seating policy. Livia Rombola alleges physical injury and severe emotional distress after Leanna Perry, an "intoxicated" Brooklyn artist, verbally abused and physically assaulted her. The lawsuit contends that Southwest's open-seating approach, a departure from industry standards, created a foreseeable hazard for passenger conflict. Southwest recently announced it would phase out the policy by January 2026. Perry, who was zip-tied and removed from the flight, faces multiple misdemeanor charges, to which she pleaded not guilty.</p>

This option allows individuals aged 62 or older to receive monthly payments from their home equity without immediate repayment obligations, unlike traditional loans. With significant equity available, seniors can access a sizable amount of money without worrying about the fluctuating interest rate climate, as monthly repayments are not required. A reverse mortgage can also be strategically used to pay down high-interest debt, offering financial independence, though careful consideration of terms and conditions is always advised.
