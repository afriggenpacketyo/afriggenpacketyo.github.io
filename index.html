          <p>At least 19 people have died and dozens sustained injuries in Nepal following widespread demonstrations against a government-imposed social media ban and rampant corruption. Thousands, primarily from 'Generation Z', gathered near the parliament building in Kathmandu, clashing with security forces who deployed water cannons, batons, and rubber bullets. Protesters view the ban, which targeted popular platforms like Facebook and X, as a direct attempt to silence dissent and deflect from deeper public dissatisfaction over the government's failure to address longstanding economic issues. The government maintains the ban is necessary to combat fake news and online fraud, but citizens heavily rely on these platforms for communication, news, and business, fueling the widespread unrest.</p>

          <p>China's advanced carrier-borne J-35 stealth fighter jets, alongside the J-35A, recently showcased their capabilities in aerial formations during a parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II's end. Designers revealed on state television that the J-35 can internally house up to six air-to-air missiles, a capacity that notably matches America’s most advanced operational stealth fighter, the F-22. This impressive loadout is made possible by innovative foldable fins and a compressed launcher concept, signaling significant advancements in China's military aviation technology. Military analysts further speculate these jets are equipped with the formidable PL-15 beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, marking a substantial enhancement in China's air combat potential.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested the Supreme Court to intervene and allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding, challenging a recent lower court order. This legal maneuver is part of President Trump's broader effort to claw back money already appropriated by Congress for foreign assistance programs, utilizing a rarely employed pocket rescission strategy. The contentious dispute involves over $4 billion in aid that a district court had explicitly ordered to be spent by the end of September, alongside another $6.5 billion in foreign assistance. The Solicitor General argues that the lower court's injunction poses a "grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers," compelling the Executive Branch to act against its own stated objectives in foreign affairs.</p>

          <p>A Florida man, Thomas Peterson, recently made an intriguing discovery while fishing with his grandson in the Aripeka mud flats: the remains of what he believes to be a 19th-century rum-runner wreckage. Visible during low tide, the find consists of wooden beams and planks, hinting at a historical vessel. Peterson also uncovered a purplish piece of glass, possibly a remnant of a liquor bottle, suggesting the ship predates the Prohibition era and adding to its mysterious origin. Local archaeologists are now investigating the site to verify its historical significance, after which the wreckage will be protected and managed by the state of Florida under archaeological statutes, preserving this piece of local history.</p>

However, the project has been a source of intense regional tension, with downstream neighbors Sudan and Egypt voicing grave concerns. They warn that the dam could severely impact their vital Nile water supplies and breach international law, with Egypt explicitly declaring water security an "existential threat" in the absence of a comprehensive water-sharing agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With persistent inflation and high interest rates continuing to burden household budgets, financial experts are providing five effective strategies to help consumers curb credit card spending this fall. Key recommendations include creating and strictly adhering to a seasonal budget, a crucial step for managing upcoming expenses like back-to-school and early holiday shopping. They also advise using debit or cash for everyday purchases to create a psychological distance from spending, and removing saved credit cards from online shopping accounts to reduce impulse buys. Additionally, setting up transaction alerts at spending midpoints and avoiding "buy now, pay later" schemes are highlighted as essential tactics to prevent accumulating high-interest debt and maintain financial health during this period.

          <p>Facing job loss at the age of 64, just two years before planned retirement, presents a critical financial dilemma for many individuals, especially those with ongoing mortgage payments. This article explores various options available, such as filing for unemployment benefits, which is contingent on whether the termination was "for cause." Another consideration is taking early Social Security benefits, though this would result in a permanent reduction in lifetime payments. Financial experts suggest that finding part-time or "bridge" work could help cover the income gap until full retirement age. The piece underscores that retirement planning is often more complex and unpredictable than initial projections, advising consultation with a financial advisor to sort through trade-offs and ensure long-term income stability.

          <p>A new, politically charged mural by the elusive street artist Banksy has appeared on the side of the Royal Courts of Justice building in central London, depicting a judge striking a protester. The artwork, which Banksy authenticated via Instagram, emerged just two days after nearly 900 people were arrested at a London protest against the ban on Palestine Action, suggesting a direct commentary on current events. Shortly after its appearance, the mural was quickly covered up by large plastic sheets and metal barriers, guarded by security officers. This swift concealment highlights the contentious nature of Banksy's work, which frequently critiques government policy, war, and capitalism, using public spaces to spark dialogue and challenge authority.</p>

          <p>Highly likable people aren't merely "fake nice" or inherently charismatic; they consistently make others feel seen through genuine interest and curiosity, according to a leading communication expert. This crucial skill is cultivated through small, everyday habits that signal warmth, attentiveness, and respect. Examples include remembering minor details about others' lives, such as a project update or a favorite coffee order, and freely giving credit to teammates and collaborators. Other key habits involve responding to everyone with respect, even if briefly, admitting when wrong to build trust, and making time for seemingly "unimportant" conversations. These seemingly small interactions compound over time, humanizing individuals and fostering stronger, more meaningful relationships, demonstrating that likability is a learnable skill crucial for both professional and personal success.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup squad faces a significant challenge as star full-back Ellie Kildunne will miss the crucial quarter-final match against Scotland due to concussion symptoms. Kildunne, who was recently voted World Rugby's women's player of the year, leaves substantial shoes to fill, with head coach John Mitchell weighing options between Emma Sing and Helena Rowland. Sing offers strong kicking and a developing running game but remains less experienced at the highest level, while Rowland, a versatile utility back with 43 caps and prior World Cup final experience, is considered more polished for the pressures of knockout rugby. The decision will hinge on balancing experience, defensive prowess, and specific skill sets required for this pivotal match.</p>

Candidates must secure significant backing from at least 80 MPs and either 5% of local parties or three Labour affiliated groups to stand.

However, there is a growing demand for AI skills across various sectors, and many experts predict AI will primarily augment human workers rather than fully replace them. This trend encourages companies to retrain employees, and individuals are advised to proactively learn how AI can be a valuable tool in their respective fields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed comparison of the monthly energy costs associated with owning an electric Tesla versus a Honda CR-V Hybrid, offering valuable insights for potential car buyers. Charging a Tesla at home is estimated to cost around $0.05 per mile, leveraging the efficiency of electric motors. In contrast, fueling a CR-V Hybrid, which averages about 40 miles per gallon at today's national gas prices, comes out to approximately $0.08 per mile. For an average American driver covering 1,015 miles monthly, the Tesla proves significantly more economical at $50.75 per month compared to $81.20 for the hybrid.

Critics warn that the $6.2 billion deal could lead to significantly higher utility bills, despite the firms agreeing to a one-year rate freeze and non-binding commitments to green energy investments. Concerns are deeply rooted in private equity's historical tendency to rapidly increase utility prices at the expense of consumers, coupled with BlackRock's expanding fossil fuel portfolio. An administrative law judge has already recommended rejecting the proposal, citing a significant risk that the firm would prioritize profits over the state's decarbonization goals and equitable rates, potentially opening floodgates for similar acquisitions.

          <p>Jury selection has officially begun for the criminal trial of Ryan Routh, the man charged with attempting to assassinate President Trump last year at his West Palm Beach country club. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assault on a federal officer, and several firearm violations, is set to represent himself in court. Prosecutors allege Routh methodically plotted the attack for weeks, attempting to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon and a .50 caliber rifle, before aiming an AK-47-style rifle at a Secret Service agent. This high-profile incident highlights serious security concerns surrounding political figures and underscores the complexities of domestic threats and political extremism in the current climate.</p>

          <p>The long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, designed to transport natural gas between Russia and China, is anticipated to create a "structural shock" to the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade if it becomes operational. Analysts suggest that this overland supply route would offer China a cheaper and more secure energy source, enabling it to bypass maritime chokepoints and insulate itself from volatile global price fluctuations. The $13.6 billion project gained renewed urgency for Russia following extensive Western sanctions imposed after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, positioning China as a crucial alternative market for its energy exports. However, unresolved issues such as pricing and the exact pipeline route could prolong the period of negotiations, delaying its full impact on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is set to open on its traditional October 1st date for the 2026-27 school year, signaling a return to normalcy after previous delays and complications. Students seeking federal loans and grants must complete the form, though it's crucial to note that institutional deadlines for aid are often much earlier than the federal one. Notable changes for this aid year include new eligibility criteria for Pell Grants and revised limits on parent PLUS and graduate PLUS loans, which will affect new borrowers from July 1, 2026. Despite past confusion and ongoing reforms in the federal student loan space, financial experts strongly encourage every student and their family to submit the FAFSA, as there is no income limit to qualify for potential aid.

Her new memoir explores this "restless, unruly life as a seditious traitor-writer," a path profoundly shaped by a complex childhood and a deep-seated desire to understand her country's marginalized communities. Roy's outspoken activism has led to significant legal challenges, including prosecution for comments on Kashmir, and her political essays have become as influential and controversial as her fiction. This article highlights her journey as an author who found her voice in dissent, demonstrating the profound connection between her artistic expression and her unwavering commitment to social justice, even at great personal cost.</p>

          <p>“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” secured its first-ever Emmy Award for outstanding directing, a notable achievement coming less than two months after CBS controversially announced its cancellation. This victory arrives after Colbert publicly criticized CBS for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump, who subsequently celebrated the news of the show's demise on social media. CBS's chair of television media, George Cheeks, attributed the cancellation to broader financial headwinds confronting the late-night talk show format, rather than political motivations. The Emmy win is perceived by many television industry insiders as a reaction to the public consternation generated by its cancellation, marking a significant, albeit bittersweet, achievement for a show that had amassed over 30 nominations without a win in its category during Colbert's tenure.</p>

Despite the gaffe, organizers claimed it inadvertently made the items "the most unique T-shirt and medal in Great North Run history," suggesting they would become a memorable keepsake.

Addressing the National Assembly, Bayrou issued a stark warning about France's precarious financial situation, attributing the accumulated debt and a "broken contract of trust between generations" to his own "baby boomer" generation. Should he be ousted, President Emmanuel Macron will be compelled to appoint a fifth prime minister in less than two years, navigating a deeply fragmented parliament where both far-right and far-left parties appear determined to bring down the government.

Bessent stated that delaying a ruling until June 2026 could result in $750 billion-$1 trillion in collected tariffs needing to be unwound, potentially causing significant economic disruption. The administration is, however, developing backup plans, including implementing tariffs through other legal authorities like Section 232, should the Supreme Court block the current ones, aiming to maintain its trade policy objectives.

This collective action, organized by Film Makers for Palestine, represents the latest celebrity-backed protest against the severe humanitarian situation in Gaza. The boycott urges the industry to "refuse silence, racism, and dehumanisation" and to end complicity in what they describe as oppression, drawing inspiration from a similar movement against apartheid South Africa.

          <p>New Covid vaccine guidelines, reportedly spearheaded by the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, are significantly restricting vaccine access in the US, causing considerable stress and concern amidst surging cases. The FDA has authorized vaccines primarily for individuals 65 and older or those with underlying medical conditions, effectively leaving many younger individuals ineligible for widespread vaccination. This policy shift, marking the first fall/winter without broad vaccination recommendations, has intensified fears among Americans about protecting vulnerable loved ones and themselves from the virus. Healthcare professionals and affected citizens alike express profound concern that these changes, perceived as ideologically driven rather than scientifically based, will inevitably lead to increased illness, severe outcomes, and mortality, severely impacting public health and individual well-being across the nation.</p>

The fatal confrontation occurred after Phillips allegedly robbed an agricultural supplies store, during which an officer was critically injured. One child was recovered at the scene of the shootout, and the other two children were subsequently found hours later at a remote campsite in a rugged forest, unaccompanied. Phillips had been wanted for previous crimes, including an armed bank robbery, and had initially taken his children over a custody dispute, denying them formal education or healthcare for years.
