          <h2>Nvidia and Anthropic Clash Over AI Chip Export Restrictions to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 15:04:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia publicly criticized Anthropic over the AI startup's defense of U.S. chip export restrictions on China, calling Anthropic's claims of smuggling tactics "tall tales." Anthropic had argued for tighter controls, suggesting chips were being smuggled in unusual ways, such as hidden in "prosthetic baby bumps." Nvidia countered that American firms should focus on innovation instead of relying on such narratives. The debate comes as the "AI Diffusion Rule," which imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips to prevent China from advancing in AI, is set to take effect, adding uncertainty to the already contentious policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Marco Rubio will serve as interim National Security Advisor while continuing his role as Secretary of State, following Michael Waltz's nomination as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. The move came after increasing frustration with Waltz, stemming from a Signal chat mishap involving a reporter. Rubio, who was attending a National Prayer Event when the announcement broke, will take on the additional responsibilities while maintaining his State Department duties. This transition reflects ongoing adjustments within the Trump administration's national security team during its first 100 days. Optimism is moderate as the administration navigates personnel changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that any country purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will be barred from doing business with the United States, escalating his "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran. This move aims to halt Iran's oil exports, which the administration believes are used to fund militant groups. Experts suggest the sanctions are primarily targeted at China, a major importer of Iranian oil. The president's statements underscore his strategy of negotiating with Iran from a position of strength, even as discussions regarding its nuclear program continue.</p>

          <p>Governors from northeastern Nigeria are urging the government to adopt a new approach to address the resurgence of Islamist militant attacks, which have claimed over 100 lives recently.

The governors emphasize the need for improved education, infrastructure, and investment opportunities to counter recruitment into militant groups.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan requiring placebo-controlled studies for all new vaccines, a move some experts find surprising given existing testing standards. The announcement raises questions about the availability of updated COVID shots, as booster shots have been authorized without human trials to target new strains. Kennedy also unveiled an NIH initiative to accelerate new inoculations for COVID, bird flu, and seasonal flu, exploring methods beyond mRNA technology. While some scientists see value in understanding potential vaccine effects, concerns exist about delaying approval of lifesaving shots, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Automakers, including Ford, Hyundai, and Kia, reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers rushing to purchase new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. The "tariff fear-buying" was fueled by automakers offering discounts or promising to hold prices steady. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices rose, signaling that the initial surge may not last. Economists predict that higher costs and reduced inventories could lead to lower sales in the coming weeks.</p>

Under the RAP plan, monthly payments would be a percentage of borrowers' income, ranging from 1% to 10% based on earnings.

While high-rate options are less plentiful than in previous years, securing rates of 4% or more is still possible with short-term CDs or high-yield savings accounts. The article recommends considering the affordability of long-term CDs and reaching out to banks to discuss intentions before the account matures, to avoid automatic rollover into accounts with lower rates. It emphasizes proactive steps to maximize returns and prepare for future high-interest earning opportunities.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic explores the implications of Joseph Kent, Trump's nominee to head the National Counterterrorism Center, having a "PANZER" tattoo, given its association with Nazi Germany. Kent's background includes associations with far-right extremists, raising questions about the tattoo's meaning. The article contrasts this with the Trump administration's scrutiny of immigrants' tattoos, used to justify deportations, suggesting a double standard. The article also notes that Defense Secretary Hegseth has tattoos of the Jerusalem Cross, Deus Vult, and the Arabic word Kafir, which have been co-opted by modern extremists.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals from the Southern District of Texas, ruling the White House's use of the law illegal. The judge rejected the administration's attempt to apply the act, intended for wartime, to modern immigration policy. The ruling, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases challenging the statute's use. The judge found that the act's language, such as "invasion," did not align with Trump's claims about the Tren de Aragua gang.</p>
