          <p>As confidence in U.S. assets wanes, emerging markets are gaining traction, fueled by factors like a weaker U.S. dollar, a potential peak in U.S. bond yields, and anticipated economic recovery in China. Bank of America has recently touted emerging markets as 'the next bull market,' while JPMorgan has upgraded emerging market equities, citing attractive valuations and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has already shown strong year-to-date growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating has further bolstered this trend, increasing concerns among traders and investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are urging the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses these airlines of misleading passengers and causing confusion with additional charges for baggage. The consumer groups are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities in EU states, demanding sanctions for the allegedly illegal practices. Ryanair and Norwegian have responded by asserting that their baggage policies comply with EU law, while other airlines referred to a statement by Airlines for Europe, arguing that the action would reduce consumer choice.</p>

This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade talks, despite President Trump's concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Kato expressed concern about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets, emphasizing that tariffs are an inappropriate tool for addressing trade imbalances.

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to garner support for a budget package containing his second-term agenda, as GOP leaders made concessions to fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson aimed to hold a vote on the bill, but faced challenges from both conservative members seeking deeper spending cuts and moderates concerned about the state and local tax deduction (SALT). The Rules Committee met for an extended period to address these concerns, eventually unveiling a 'manager's amendment' that included changes to Medicaid work requirements and the SALT deduction. The legislation faces opposition from Democrats, and its passage hinges on reconciling the demands of the party's factions.</p>

Kim Jong Un blamed military officials, scientists, and shipyard operators for the accident, describing it as a 'serious accident and criminal act' caused by carelessness.

The waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including an EV mandate requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers under the Congressional Review Act, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent.

          <p>Alejandro Oliveros Acosta, accused of killing and maiming up to 20 cats in Santa Ana, failed to appear at his arraignment hearing, leading to the issuance of an arrest warrant. Acosta faces felony charges of animal cruelty and grand theft of a companion animal, as well as a misdemeanor charge of drug possession. Authorities believe Acosta was behind the deaths of several neighborhood cats and admitted to killing approximately 20 cats. The case has sparked public outcry, and the district attorney's office sought to increase his bail, citing his immense danger.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas experiencing temperatures 4°C warmer than normal, leading to a marine heatwave. This phenomenon, driven by climate change and an exceptionally warm spring, has potential implications for marine life and swimmers. Scientists are monitoring the situation closely, as marine heatwaves can disrupt breeding patterns, cause harmful algae blooms, and alter the distribution of fish species. The current heatwave has persisted for over two months, an unusually long duration, and scientists are working to understand its full impact.</p>
