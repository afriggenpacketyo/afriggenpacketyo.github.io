          <p>The Republican National Committee reported raising $16.2 million in June, nearly doubling the $8.6 million raised by the Democratic National Committee during the same period. This fundraising success has expanded the RNC's total cash on hand to over $80 million, compared to the DNC's $15 million. The report comes as the Democratic party navigates internal challenges, though DNC leadership highlighted that June was a record-breaking month for grassroots donations in a non-election year. Republican congressional committees also saw a fundraising advantage over their Democratic counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight approaching Minot, North Dakota, was forced to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 military bomber. The pilot informed passengers that the bomber appeared on a converging course unexpectedly, as the airport's control tower operates visually without radar. The Air Force confirmed the B-52 was conducting a pre-approved flyover for a local event and stated the tower did not advise its crew of the inbound commercial flight. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the serious incident.</p>

These shells provide a critical habitat for new oysters to grow, which in turn filter the water and support hundreds of other marine species. After a year-long curing process to eliminate contaminants, the shells are deposited back into the sound, helping to rebuild vital and historically overfished oyster beds.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis details how President Donald Trump has increasingly used the judicial system to push his policy agenda, reshaping the balance of power in the U.S. government. The article points to recent Supreme Court rulings that have expanded presidential immunity and curbed the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, emboldening the administration. This strategy, combined with public criticism of judges and a high volume of executive orders, has led to frequent legal battles. The report questions whether this approach will permanently alter presidential power and the judiciary's role as a check on the executive branch.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency is primarily driven by personal pettiness and vengefulness rather than a coherent policy ideology. The author cites several examples, including the renaming of military bases, barring a former intelligence director from a CIA event, and the president's shifting stance on Ukraine based on whether he feels personally slighted by Vladimir Putin. The piece suggests this focus on retribution and settling personal scores taints the executive branch and substitutes for substantive governance, leading to capricious and emotionally-driven decision-making on critical national and international issues.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has received approval from the Pentagon to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants who have entered the U.S. illegally. According to official correspondence, the plan also includes increasing detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The bases, Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, will provide space for up to 1,000 people each. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to expand detention capacity amid a nationwide push to arrest more undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>A report from NPR examines the controversial judicial nomination of Emil Bove, suggesting he may represent a new type of judicial appointment under the Trump administration. During his first term, President Trump relied heavily on the Federalist Society to select judges with a conservative, originalist philosophy. The article posits that Bove's nomination signals a potential shift in this process as the administration restarts its efforts to reshape the federal courts. Bove is presented as one of the most contentious nominees, and his potential confirmation is being closely watched by legal and political observers.</p>

          <p>Despite China reporting robust headline economic figures, many citizens are experiencing a starkly different reality of financial strain and job insecurity. An accountant in Chengdu, for example, has not had a raise in five years and now faces potential layoffs, making dreams like homeownership feel unattainable. Financial experts note this growing disconnect between official data and the actual sentiment of households and businesses. Many individuals feel the economic situation is weak and uncertain, a sharp contrast to the more optimistic picture painted by government statistics for the first half of the year.

The individual, who works for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, was visiting the country in a personal capacity to see family.

The U.S. government stated it is actively engaged with Chinese officials to resolve the situation, which highlights the use of exit bans as a contentious diplomatic and legal tool by Beijing.</p>

This assignment raises the possibility that Trump will again face a decision on whether to sit for a deposition under oath, this time from Murdoch's legal team.

          <p>According to a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the latest tax bill signed by President Trump is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill's $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, including making the 2017 cuts permanent, are only partially offset by $1.1 trillion in spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps. The CBO estimates these cuts will result in 10 million Americans losing health insurance by 2034, while the bill also boosts funding for border security and immigration enforcement.

Harvard's lawyers argued the move was an attempt to control the university and would harm vital research, while government lawyers insisted the cuts were a necessary punishment.
