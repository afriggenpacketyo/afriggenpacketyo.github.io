          <p>China's food delivery market is seeing intensified competition as major players Meituan and JD.com invest heavily in central kitchen infrastructure. Meituan plans to launch 1,200 'Raccoon Restaurants' over three years, which are food court-style hubs designed exclusively for takeaways to lower costs and increase efficiency for its partners. In response, JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own 7Fresh kitchens, aiming to develop and promote a thousand different menus nationwide. These strategic moves signal a new phase in the battle for dominance in the on-demand local delivery industry.</p>

          <p>Colombia experienced a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, with the Amazon rainforest bearing the brunt of the destruction. According to government data, approximately 113,608 hectares of forest were lost, reversing a positive trend from 2023 which had seen the lowest levels in over two decades. Authorities attribute the surge to land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, illicit crop cultivation, and wildfires exacerbated by climate change. Despite the spike, officials note that the overall deforestation rate remains below the 2021 baseline, indicating a net reduction over a longer period.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued conflicting statements regarding the future of its trade pact with China, particularly concerning a potential extension of the current pause on tariff hikes. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt expressed doubt that an extension was being considered, while also highlighting progress in reducing the trade deficit with China. President Trump has yet to publicly confirm his decision on the matter, stating he would do so after being briefed on recent talks led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The uncertainty leaves the status of the trade negotiations and tariff policies in a state of flux.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve extending its pause on interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a strategic decision. The article suggests that the current high-rate environment, with many CDs still offering over 4% APY, presents a valuable opportunity to lock in favorable returns for a longer term. It advises savers to act before their CD automatically renews, potentially at a lower rate, and to shop around for the best available offers. The continued pause provides a window to secure high rates before potential future cuts by the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

This article poses three critical questions for borrowers to consider, including whether small rate cuts would have made a significant difference and the importance of creating a personal debt reduction plan. It emphasizes that relying on external factors is insufficient and encourages exploring various debt relief options, from DIY methods like the debt snowball to professional services. The focus is on empowering borrowers to take proactive steps toward financial independence despite the unfavorable rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and profit, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion. However, the company's shares declined over 7% in extended trading due to a lighter-than-expected operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter, raising investor concerns about the costs of its significant AI investments. While the advertising business was a bright spot with 23% growth, its cloud unit, AWS, grew by 18%, trailing the growth rates of competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, which is a key area of focus for investors.

She also recounted how teams, including her former Phoenix Mercury squad, specifically targeted Clark with aggressive play during her rookie season, suggesting the treatment she receives is excessive. Cunningham's comments highlight the ongoing debate surrounding Clark's influence and the intense on-court reception she has faced since entering the league.</p>

The test, which evolved over the years, typically included a one-mile run, sit-ups, and pull-ups to assess overall fitness. This article provides historical context, noting Eisenhower's original motivation was linked to national security and combat readiness.

The author points to actions like imposing tariffs on Brazil in response to the prosecution of ally Jair Bolsonaro and threatening Canada over its recognition of a Palestinian state. The piece contends that these moves use U.S. economic power to achieve non-economic, personal goals, undermining American credibility and ultimately hurting U.S. consumers.

However, the piece notes that rates are variable and the difference is minimal.

          <p>A powerful storm system has prompted states of emergency in New York City and New Jersey, bringing torrential rainfall and dangerous flash flooding to the U.S. East Coast. Forecasters warned of rainfall rates up to three inches an hour, leading to submerged highways, suspended commuter rail service, and significant flight delays and cancellations at major airports. Officials urged residents to avoid travel and for those in basement apartments to move to higher ground. The severe weather, which also impacted Pennsylvania and Maryland with flooding and water rescues, highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme precipitation events.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that he had kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club for 'stealing' employees, including Giuffre. In a statement, Giuffre's family said the comment 'makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions' at the time. The family is calling for answers, stating that survivors deserve to know the extent of what was known about Epstein's sex trafficking operation.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team faces a significant setback as pace bowler Chris Woakes is expected to miss the rest of the decisive fifth Test against India due to a shoulder injury. Woakes was injured while attempting to stop a boundary on the opening day, leaving the field in visible discomfort. The injury is a major blow to an already depleted England bowling attack and raises concerns about the 36-year-old's future in international cricket, particularly ahead of the upcoming Ashes tour.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that changes to federal student loan programs under the Trump administration's new budget bill will make professional degrees less accessible, exacerbating shortages of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals. The author, a law professor, highlights that new federal loan limits will not cover the high tuition at medical and law schools, forcing students into less flexible and more expensive private loans. The article urges California to create its own state-level loan program to fill the gap, arguing that investing in the education of future professionals is crucial for the state's health and justice systems.

          <p>This analysis argues that recent agreements between elite universities like Columbia and the Trump administration are setting a dangerous precedent for academic freedom. After being threatened with the loss of federal funding over allegations of civil rights violations, Columbia agreed to pay massive penalties and implement significant policy changes, including cracking down on protests and reviewing departmental curricula. The article suggests this serves as a 'road map' for political coercion, emboldening the administration to pressure other, less-resourced institutions into compromising their autonomy, potentially chilling free speech and dialogue across all of higher education.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, part of a larger force sent by the Trump administration to manage protests against federal immigration policies. The deployment, which was met with strong opposition from California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, was criticized for pulling troops from other essential duties. While 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, the withdrawal is seen as a victory by local politicians who argued that protest management should be handled by local law enforcement, marking a de-escalation of federal presence.</p>

The reversal came after days of large-scale protests, primarily led by young Ukrainians who argued that protecting these institutions was vital for the nation's path toward EU integration. The demonstrations, the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion, successfully pressured the government to backtrack. The event is seen as a victory for Ukraine's civil society but has raised questions about Zelensky's commitment to anti-corruption reforms.</p>

          <p>Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell after the company reported second-quarter revenue of $1.5 billion, which was slightly below analyst expectations. While the company posted a net income of $1.43 billion, largely due to gains on its crypto investments, its core transaction revenue missed estimates. Weaker retail trading volumes during the quarter were not fully offset by growth in subscriptions and services. The results reflect a slowdown from the first quarter's exuberance, as speculative trading cooled while Washington's policy focus shifted away from the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>
