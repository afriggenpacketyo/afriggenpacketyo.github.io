          <p>Following a call between senior officials, the U.S. and China have agreed to maintain open communication channels, indicating continued engagement in trade negotiations. This diplomatic exchange, the second of its kind during President Trump's second term, suggests both sides are preparing for future discussions, potentially focusing on Beijing's cooperation in curbing fentanyl flows. The call, prompted by a meeting between Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, signals a reconnection on the diplomatic level, with both sides aiming to achieve concrete outcomes for the American people. The ongoing dialogue reflects a positive step toward resolving trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to explore a face-to-face meeting in June, coinciding with the Group of Seven summit in Canada, to discuss ongoing tariff negotiations. Both leaders expressed optimism for a productive round of ministerial-level tariff talks in Washington, emphasizing the need to achieve "win-win" bilateral relations. Japan has been urging the United States to reconsider its tariff policy, particularly the 25 percent import duty on cars, due to concerns about its impact on the export-driven Japanese economy. While a 24 percent "reciprocal" tariff has been put on hold, the United States is still imposing a 10 percent baseline duty, along with levies targeting steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>BYD, a Chinese carmaker, has outsold Tesla in Europe for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in April, marking a significant shift in the European electric vehicle market. Despite facing hefty tariffs on cars imported from mainland China, BYD's BEV sales surged by 169 percent year-on-year, reaching 7,231 units, while Tesla's sales fell by 49 percent to 7,165 units. This milestone underscores the growing influence of Chinese carmakers in the European market, with their BEV sales jumping by 59 percent year on year in April, despite EU tariffs. The article notes that BEVs accounted for 17 percent of new car registrations in Europe during April, reflecting a steady increase in demand for electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the resurgence of the ‚ÄúDEI hire‚Äù taunt, a term used to undermine individuals from non-traditional backgrounds who hold enviable jobs, particularly in the context of Donald Trump's war on woke. This phenomenon creates a climate where prejudice and doubt can resurface, feeding into the feeling that someone has a job that could have been yours. The author argues that this taunt exploits an age-old grievance, creating a climate where previously unsayable sentiments are voiced with confidence. Ultimately, it contributes to the ‚Äúimpostor syndrome‚Äù experienced by successful women and men from non-traditional backgrounds, who fear being exposed as frauds.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Lydia Polgreen analyzes the meeting between President Trump and South Africa‚Äôs President Cyril Ramaphosa, highlighting the improbable commonalities between the two leaders while underscoring Trump's exploitation of the meeting to promote a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. The author emphasizes that Trump hijacked the discussions, focusing on a misleading video and false claims rather than addressing serious issues such as tariffs and aid cuts. Polgreen notes that Ramaphosa, known for his deal-making skills, was met with theatrics and propaganda, revealing Trump‚Äôs disinterest in genuine negotiation. The piece concludes that while Trump may have achieved his immediate goals, he ultimately damaged America's reputation and influence on the global stage.</p>

          <p>The Maya Ixil community in Guatemala is mobilizing to defend its ancestral territory against transnational corporations installing hydroelectric plants without community consultation. This social movement, detailed in the book "The Fourth Invasion," highlights the adverse impacts on indigenous communities, with corporations prioritizing their interests over the rights of the local population. The community has faced multiple historical invasions, including the Spanish conquest, land dispossession, and the genocide of 1982, during which many community members were killed. Despite these challenges, the Maya Ixil community continues to fight for its rights, demanding respect for indigenous consultation rights and the protection of natural resources.</p>

Columbia stated it is committed to combating anti-Semitism and all forms of harassment and discrimination on campus and will continue to work with the government to address these issues. The Trump administration has also targeted other universities, including Harvard, which has refused to comply with its demands.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Sir Keir Starmer and other world leaders of siding with Hamas, claiming they "effectively said they want Hamas to remain in power". Netanyahu's remarks come in response to international criticism of Israel's military operations and restrictions on humanitarian aid in Gaza. Downing Street has declined to comment directly on Netanyahu's remarks, but pointed to Sir Keir's previous condemnation of the Washington attack on X.
