          <p>Robin Kaye, a 70-year-old former music supervisor for "American Idol," and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found shot to death in their Encino, California home. Police discovered the couple during a wellness check, revealing they had been shot multiple times. A 22-year-old suspect, Raymond Boodarian, was arrested after being identified through surveillance footage and facial recognition software. Investigators believe the suspect entered the home through an unlocked door while the couple was out and confronted them upon their return. The suspect has a history of violent crime charges, though they were previously dropped.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 2025 Open Championship, those present recall the day a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy shot a record-setting 61 at Royal Portrush in 2005. Playing partners describe how a small group of spectators swelled to over a thousand as word spread of his incredible performance, which included an eagle and five consecutive birdies to finish. They remember a supremely confident teenager who seemed destined for superstardom, relishing the pressure and displaying the focus that would define his career. The article contrasts this early triumph with his later professional struggles, highlighting his resilience and enduring connection with fans.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International fell over 6% despite the company forecasting a significant increase in first-half earnings, with profits expected to rise by at least 350%. The company, known for its popular "blind box" toys like the Labubu character, attributed its positive forecast to growing global brand recognition and strong overseas sales. However, some analysts suggest the stock's decline reflects investor concern that the company's growth may have peaked, leading to profit-taking. Despite the dip, many investment banks maintain a bullish outlook on the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with net sales reaching 7.7 billion euros against a forecast of 7.52 billion. The company's net bookings, a key indicator of future demand, were particularly strong at 5.5 billion euros, well above the anticipated 4.19 billion. As the sole producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, ASML is critical to the manufacturing of advanced chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia. The positive results come as the company navigates market uncertainty related to U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes President Trump's recent shift in policy towards Ukraine, suggesting it is motivated by financial pragmatism rather than a change of heart regarding Russia. The author argues that Trump, previously critical of U.S. aid to Kyiv, has been persuaded by European allies footing more of the bill for military support, including Patriot missile systems. The piece posits that NATO's commitment to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP has framed the support for Ukraine as a good deal for the U.S., not a handout. This transactional approach, while providing temporary relief for Ukraine, remains volatile and dependent on Trump's perception of who is paying.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Beijing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the departure of many Chinese academics and researchers from the U.S. back to China as a "great loss" for America. While expressing happiness for them returning to their home country, he emphasized the negative impact when the brightest minds educated in the U.S. choose to leave. Huang, himself an immigrant from Taiwan, framed his comments around the importance of the U.S. remaining a country where people can pursue the "American dream." His remarks highlight the geopolitical tensions affecting the global flow of scientific and technical talent.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to "come forward and explain" her past comments regarding Jeffrey Epstein's alleged "client list." Bondi previously stated a file was on her desk for review but later clarified it was not a specific list, sparking criticism from some Trump supporters. Johnson, while expressing trust in the administration, stated that transparency is needed. The comments reflect growing pressure from within the Republican party for more information on the Epstein case, with some lawmakers calling for convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House reportedly demanded that the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the nation's largest public utility, fire its CEO, Don Moul, or be fired themselves. The board resisted the ultimatum, defending Moul's performance in a letter to the administration. The move is believed to be linked to President Trump's intervention in a dispute over a proposed TVA power plant near the home of country singer John Rich. Sources suggest the pressure could be part of a broader strategy to install a more politically aligned CEO and potentially set the stage for privatizing the government-owned utility.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially paving the way for wider adoption of digital dollars for payments. This is part of a broader "Crypto Week" push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the digital asset industry. Proponents argue it will enable faster, lower-cost transactions, while some financial institutions are already exploring issuing their own stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. has launched a formal investigation into Brazil's trade practices, which it describes as "unfair" and discriminatory against American commerce. The probe, directed by President Trump, will examine Brazil's policies on digital trade, electronic payments, preferential tariffs, and intellectual property enforcement. This action follows Trump's call for Brazil to end its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and a threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. The investigation escalates trade tensions between the two largest economies in the Americas, which conducted $90 billion in trade last year.</p>

The piece argues that tailored, local-level legislation creates a stable and predictable legal framework, which is crucial for fostering market activity.

Republican committee members accused the schools of failing to discipline faculty and allowing unchecked bias, while Democrats criticized the hearings as "political theater."

The government obtained a super-injunction to prevent media reporting on the leak and the subsequent relocation program, which has cost £400 million so far.

Key political allies, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have called for greater transparency.
