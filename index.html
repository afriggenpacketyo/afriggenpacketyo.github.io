            <p>The article discusses the impending removal of hereditary peers from the House of Lords as part of a new Labour government's efforts to modernize the legislative body. Hereditary peers, who inherited their positions, had their rights to legislate curtailed in 1999, but 92 were allowed to remain as a temporary compromise. The remaining hereditary peers express mixed feelings about their departure, with some defending their long-term perspective and others acknowledging the anachronism of their positions. The article also touches on potential future reforms to the House of Lords, including term limits and size restrictions.</p>

De León's spokesperson stated that the matters centered on disclosure, not personal gain, and that the outcomes would have been the same regardless of his recusal. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law invoked by the Trump administration. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, following an appeal from the ACLU arguing that the detainees were not given a chance to argue their case in court. The ACLU cited concerns about the conditions in El Salvador's prisons, where some Venezuelans have been deported under the Act. The White House defended the administration's actions, claiming the detainees were "foreign terrorists."</p>

The act was previously used only three times, all during war.
