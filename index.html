          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 18:30:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared his intention to reinstate Columbus Day, criticizing Democrats for diminishing Christopher Columbus's legacy and appealing to Italian-American voters. This decision reverses the trend of recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day alongside Columbus Day, a practice initiated by President Biden to acknowledge the historical exploitation of indigenous populations. Trump's stance reflects his broader objection to reinterpreting American history through a lens of diversity and oppression, while his supporters argue that Columbus Day honors Italian-American heritage. The holiday's origins trace back to efforts to unite Italian immigrants in the late 19th century.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism after deporting a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras along with her mother, and separately deporting the mother of a one-year-old to Cuba, effectively separating them. Lawyers in both cases argue that their clients were given minimal opportunity to communicate with family or legal counsel, raising concerns about due process violations. A federal judge expressed suspicion that the government deported the U.S. citizen child without meaningful process. These actions have sparked outrage from civil rights groups, who claim they violate ICE's own directives regarding the care of minor children during deportations.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has paused funding for 365 federal grant programs, impacting initiatives that support victims of hate crimes, sexual assault, and child abuse, as well as programs aimed at reducing school violence.

          <p>Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes the US-China trade war is far from its conclusion, despite recent developments. He argues that the Trump administration views the international trading system as unfair to the US, leading them to use tariffs as leverage for change. This approach involves shifting from a multilateral system to one based on reciprocal tariffs negotiated bilaterally. Kennedy suggests that the ultimate goal is to initiate negotiations that could potentially lead to tariff reductions.</p>

          <p>Ten individuals, dubbed the "grandpa robbers," are on trial for robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in Paris in 2016. The robbers, mostly born in the 1950s, made off with approximately $10 million in jewelry. The heist was plagued with blunders, including the robbers not knowing who Kardashian was and leaving DNA traces at the scene. The trial seeks to determine how the gang obtained information about Kardashian's whereabouts and the location of the stolen jewels.</p>

          <p>Israel launched an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, targeting what it claimed was a Hezbollah store of "precision-guided missiles." The attack, which occurred despite a ceasefire agreement, drew condemnation from the Lebanese presidency. The Lebanese presidency called on the US and France to press Israel to cease its attacks on the country. The UN has urged all sides to halt actions that could undermine the cessation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings are declining as he nears his first 100 days in office, with new polls showing a majority of Americans disapproving of his handling of the presidency. His approval rating, hovering between 39% and 45%, is the lowest for a newly elected president at this milestone in more than seven decades. This decline represents a shift from the uptick in favorability ratings Trump experienced upon returning to the White House in January.</p>
