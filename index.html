          <h2>Elon Musk Expresses Regret Over Social Media Posts About Donald Trump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 08:12:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk publicly stated his regret for some of his recent social media posts concerning President Donald Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far." This follows an explosive public dispute between Musk and his former close ally, Trump, which had fueled market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict began over Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk claimed would undermine the work of DOGE and substantially increase the U.S.'s budget deficit. Trump had previously threatened consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill, though he later softened his stance. The regret comes after Tesla's shares took a hit following the conflict. The author's tone is one of neutral reporting on the situation. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100 and be a multiple of 5.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased its propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea as part of President Lee Jae Myung's administration's efforts to de-escalate tensions. These broadcasts had been resumed in June of the previous year under Lee's predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, in response to North Korea's actions. The South Korean military stated that the halt is aimed at restoring trust and achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula. This decision follows a period of heightened tensions, including the exchange of trash-carrying balloons between the two countries, and reflects a shift towards a more pragmatic approach under the new South Korean leadership. The decision to stop the broadcasts is a move towards rebuilding mutual trust between the two countries.</p>

Ma, who is also a former chairman of Taiwanâ€™s main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), will lead a student visit and attend the Straits Forum in Xiamen, a city facing Taiwan. Taiwanâ€™s Mainland Affairs Council has criticized Maâ€™s decision, deeming it inappropriate and inconsistent with his position.

          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a significant increase, rising 12.5% compared to the previous week, reaching the highest level in over a month after adjusting for the Memorial Day holiday. The Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index revealed this surge, though overall volume remains low historically. Despite a slight increase in the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, applications to refinance and purchase homes both saw substantial gains. This uptick may be attributed to a loosening housing inventory in certain markets, as supply is now considerably higher than the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Inditex, the owner of Zara, reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and indicated a slower start to the summer season compared to the previous year, attributing it to broader economic uncertainty. The Spanish retailer's revenues for the fiscal first quarter fell slightly short of analyst estimates, leading to a drop in share value. The company also noted a deceleration in summer sales growth compared to the previous year. Inditex, which also owns brands like Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti, is seen as an indicator of consumer sentiment, and the company cited the unclear impact of tariffs on consumer spending as a concern.</p>

          <p>U.S. Congresswoman LaMonica McIver has been indicted on charges of "forcibly impeding and interfering" with federal law enforcement during a confrontation at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center in Newark, New Jersey. The incident occurred during an oversight visit with other members of Congress and the Mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka. The indictment alleges that McIver prevented a DHS agent from arresting Baraka, though a trespass case against Baraka was later dropped. McIver has denounced the charges as a "brazen attempt at political intimidation" and plans to plead not guilty, while the interim Attorney for the District of New Jersey emphasized that while people can express their views, they must not endanger law enforcement.</p>

Harding argues that while there was upbeat music during the Great Recession, there was also music of all kinds, and the genre is a slippery one. He suggests that the current interest in recession pop may be more about millennials aging out of being cool than about the economy.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old Austrian man carried out a mass shooting at a secondary school in Graz, Austria, killing nine people before taking his own life. The incident, which is the deadliest mass shooting in Austria's recent history, prompted a national mourning period. Police are investigating the shooter's motives and have found a "farewell letter" and a non-functional pipe bomb at his home. The shooter, a former student who did not graduate, legally owned the two guns used in the attack, leading to renewed discussions about Austria's gun laws.</p>
