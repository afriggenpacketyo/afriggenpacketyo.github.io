          <p>China's central bank has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates steady, specifically the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, following a previous rate cut in May. This decision comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China have somewhat eased due to a recent trade agreement reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs. Experts suggest that the reduced foreign exchange pressure on the renminbi gives the People's Bank of China greater flexibility in future policy maneuvers. Chinese officials are reportedly satisfied with the current monetary policy and are exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth, while keeping interest rate cuts in a supporting role.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump likely acted within his authority when federalizing the California National Guard amidst protests over immigration raids. The court's decision effectively blocks a lower court order that would have returned control of the guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The judges cited acts of violence during the protests, including protesters pinning down federal officers and damaging federal buildings, as justification for Trump's action. The appeals court order puts on hold the lower court's ruling, which had deemed Trump's action illegal and ordered the guard's control be turned over to Newsom.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck the main hospital in southern Israel, causing minor injuries and significant damage, leading to strong condemnation and vows of retaliation from Israeli leaders. Israel's defense chief accused Iran of war crimes and said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be held accountable. The attack resulted in 271 people wounded, including four with serious injuries, according to Israel's Ministry of Health. Israel has responded by increasing the intensity of attacks against strategic targets in Iran, as President Trump considers direct U.S. involvement in the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran, specifically targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site. He is reportedly concerned about whether the U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, also known as "bunker busters," can effectively destroy the facility, which is built deep into a mountain south of Tehran. Trump has indicated he will take two weeks to decide whether to strike, as Israel lacks the powerful bombs and aircraft needed to significantly damage the secretive site. The U.S. is the only country in the world to possess bunker busters, and only U.S. aircraft can deliver them.</p>

Gross, along with former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, will join Meta and work on products under Alexandr Wang, with Meta also gaining a stake in Gross and Friedman's venture capital firm, NFDG.

          <p>Indiana Fever coach Stephanie White will be taking a leave of absence for personal reasons, causing her to miss the game against the Golden State Valkyries. Assistant coach Mike Kelly will serve as the acting head coach, marking his second time in the role this season. The team's message remains consistent: playing for each other, excelling on defense, and using that energy to fuel the offense. This is White's first season in her second stint as Indiana's head coach, having previously led the Fever from 2015 to 2016.</p>
