          <p>PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by performance outside of North America. The company's global volume for food products saw a slight decline, and its North American beverage and food divisions experienced reduced demand. Despite these challenges, PepsiCo is implementing cost-cutting measures, including closing manufacturing plants and optimizing logistics, to improve profit margins. The company reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, projecting stable earnings and low single-digit revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum visited the former federal prison on Alcatraz Island, following President Trump's directive to reopen the facility. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats as a misuse of resources. Separately, the administration announced the termination of approximately $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, labeling it a 'boondoggle.' In another development, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn publicly urged the president to be more transparent regarding the Epstein controversy to reestablish trust with the American people.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party is assessing comments made by veteran MP Diane Abbott, in which she stood by previous remarks that led to her suspension. In a recent interview, Abbott reiterated her view that racism based on skin color is distinct from prejudice faced by Jewish people or Travellers, as their ethnicity is not always visible. This stance contradicts her earlier apology for a 2023 letter that caused significant controversy and was deemed antisemitic by party leader Keir Starmer. A Labour spokesperson stated the party takes the new comments 'incredibly seriously' and will evaluate them under party rules.</p>

          <p>Taiwan initiated extensive 'urban resilience' drills in Taipei and other northern cities to test its readiness for a potential conflict. Air-raid sirens prompted civilians to evacuate streets and take shelter, including in mass rapid transit stations, as part of a society-wide wartime simulation. The exercises are a direct response to increasing military and political pressure from Beijing, which views the self-governing island as its territory. Authorities enforced strict compliance with the procedures, with potential fines for individuals who failed to follow the emergency directives during the drill.</p>

          <p>The Druze are a small, distinct religious minority in the Middle East, with a global population of about one million, including around 700,000 in Syria. Their unique Abrahamic faith evolved from a branch of Shia Islam, but they do not identify as Muslim and believe in reincarnation. In Syria, the Druze community is concentrated in the southern Sweida province and has its own security forces. Following the collapse of the Assad regime, the community has had a mixed response to the new interim government, with some leaders expressing support while others remain confrontational, pressing for minority rights protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the bipartisan HALT Fentanyl Act into law, permanently placing fentanyl-related substances in the most restrictive drug category, Schedule I. This classification mandates stricter prison sentences for crimes involving these drugs and is intended to close a loophole that allowed traffickers to alter the drug's chemical structure to evade prosecution. Supporters, including numerous Republican state attorneys general, argue the law is crucial for public safety and will end a 'cat and mouse' game with drug chemists. Critics, however, warn it may not address the root causes of substance abuse and could lead to overly harsh sentencing.</p>

When factoring in the termination of enhanced insurance subsidies, this estimate rises to more than 51,000 extra deaths annually.

The economic impact depends heavily on how the U.S. defines 'transshipment'—a narrow definition would affect only relabeled goods, but a broad one could penalize any product containing Chinese components.

          <p>China is bracing for significant employment challenges as a record number of university graduates prepare to enter the job market this summer. Although the youth unemployment rate saw a slight decrease in June, it remains higher than the previous year, indicating underlying strain. Officials from the National Bureau of Statistics have acknowledged that employment pressure is increasing for key groups, including young people and migrant workers. This situation poses a critical test for the Chinese economy, which is striving to create enough quality jobs to absorb the influx of new talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an in-depth interview, Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown discusses the difficulty of separating fact from fiction in the Jeffrey Epstein saga. She explains that the concept of an 'Epstein client list' is a red herring that likely morphed from a comprehensive personal phone directory. Brown emphasizes that while there is no evidence linking Donald Trump to Epstein's crimes, his long-standing friendship and eventual falling out raise suspicions. The core issue, she argues, is not partisan politics but a broken justice system that failed Epstein's hundreds of victims for decades, allowing a powerful and wealthy individual to evade accountability.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores the growing trend of beauty and skincare companies marketing products, including those with active ingredients like retinol, to children and tweens. This expansion into younger demographics has been fueled by social media trends and the industry's need for market growth, with spending on skincare for 6- to 12-year-olds rising significantly. Experts warn of potential physical harm, as children's developing skin is more vulnerable to irritation, allergies, and long-term damage from potent ingredients. The article also discusses the serious psychological consequences of indoctrinating children into a beauty culture built on insecurity and exacting appearance standards.</p>

In response to the unrest, Syrian government forces have withdrawn from the southern Sweida province, handing security over to local Druze factions. Al-Sharaa asserted that Syria would not be dragged into a conflict that serves only to fragment the nation, blaming Israel for exploiting the country's instability.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced plans to cut up to 500 management positions in the UK through a voluntary redundancy program. The decision comes as the automaker faces significant financial pressure from U.S. trade tariffs and a drop in sales, partly due to a pause in U.S. exports and the phasing out of older models. While the company stated the move is 'normal business practice,' industry experts believe the recently negotiated 10% U.S. tariff on UK car imports plays a major role in the job cuts, creating a challenging environment for the British car industry.

The piece mocks a DHS official's statement that many 'non-criminals' are actually 'terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more' who simply lack a U.S. rap sheet. The author sarcastically argues that the lack of evidence is proof of how cunning these individuals are, and that they are considered criminals simply because they are being held in a facility for the 'worst of the worst.'

Scientific evidence does not support this association; in fact, UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The article explains that the rising incidence of skin cancer in countries with high sunscreen use is likely due to other factors. These include better diagnostics, increased time spent outdoors, historical use of less effective products, and greater public awareness leading to more documented cases.</p>

Recommended steps include removing the phone from the bedroom, turning off notifications, and setting the screen to black-and-white to make the device less rewarding.
