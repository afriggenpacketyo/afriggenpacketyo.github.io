          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who alleged sexual assault by him and Prince Andrew, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Her family stated that she had been a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, with her lawyer describing her as a champion for other victims. Giuffre's allegations against Epstein and Prince Andrew gained international attention, leading to legal settlements and contributing to the downfall of both men. Her passing marks a tragic end to a life marked by trauma and her efforts to advocate for other survivors of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he will not reduce tariffs on China unless the country offers something "substantial" in return. Speaking on Air Force One, Trump emphasized his desire for China to open its markets to U.S. businesses and products, enabling them to sell their goods freely within China. He acknowledged that a previous deal to achieve this was nearly reached but was later retracted by China. Trump's stance suggests a continued tough negotiating position with China on trade-related matters.</p>

          <p>World leaders are convening in Vatican City for Pope Francis' funeral, presenting an opportunity for informal diplomatic engagements. While formal meetings are unlikely out of respect for the solemn occasion, diplomats anticipate "brush-by" conversations among leaders. All eyes are on potential discussions between Presidents Trump and Zelensky regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine, though seating arrangements may keep them apart. The funeral could also pose risks, as sanctioned politicians may attend, potentially leading to encounters with adversaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's ongoing attacks on the media, including barring reporters and attempting to defund organizations like VOA and NPR, are facing legal challenges. Courts have ruled in favor of VOA and AP in separate lawsuits, citing First Amendment violations. However, free speech advocates caution that these freedoms require active defense, especially as Trump signals further moves against publicly funded broadcasters. The administration's actions are seen as part of a broader strategy to control the public narrative and undermine independent reporting.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" and "sex" as biological.

The EHRC emphasizes that organizations must follow the law and seek legal advice where necessary, and will launch a consultation to seek views from stakeholders.</p>

          <p>Despite a historic performance from LeBron James, the Lakers lost Game 3 to the Timberwolves, with Luka Doncic ailing. The Lakers' mistakes, including turnovers and missed free throws, were amplified by Doncic's diminished performance. James scored 38 points, the most by a player over 40 in a playoff game, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Lakers' struggles. The team now faces a crucial Game 4 with a short turnaround.</p>

          <p>Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation. Standing in front of a crowd of about 100 squeezed into a small event hall in the city of Lethbridge, Dennis Modry is asking locals about Alberta's future. Who thinks Alberta should have a bigger role in Canada, he asks? A dozen or so raise their hands. Who thinks the province should push for a split from Canada and form its own nation? About half the crowd raise their hands.</p>

The terms of this peace agreement look more like punishment; an attempt to drown Ukraine in postwar reconstruction and a future without any guarantees of peace.</p>

          <p>Chinese government official James Zhang is on a health kick. At the staff canteen, the 45-year-old piles his plate with salad and two hard-boiled eggs for lunch. Like many others in Chinese officialdom, Zhang used to be overweight due to lack of exercise, an unhealthy diet, smoking and drinking.The turnaround is not because he had a mid-life crisis, but the result of six months spent in Beijing last year at the Central Party School, where China’s next generation of leaders are trained.</p>
