          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has formed over the ocean and is currently on a path toward the northern Leeward Islands. As a Category 1 storm, it is prompting warnings for potential heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf conditions in the Caribbean. Forecasters expect Erin to strengthen into a major hurricane, potentially reaching Category 4 strength early next week. Current forecast models, however, show the storm is likely to curve northward and remain well offshore of the U.S. East Coast, steered away by a high-pressure system.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, citing intense outside interest following a campaign from activist investors. The move comes after the company's stock surged dramatically from a low that put it at risk of being delisted, driven by a retail investor push led by hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Wheeler, who became CEO in 2022, stated her departure would allow new leadership to take over as the company navigates a challenging market shaped by high interest rates. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna has been named interim leader.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with its CEO describing California as an "anti-business" and expensive state to operate in. This relocation is part of a broader trend of companies, including Tesla and Charles Schwab, leaving California for states with more favorable business climates. Playboy's new base will be in a luxury office building and includes plans for a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios. The move marks a strategic return to South Florida, where the brand historically had a significant presence.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit in Alaska, the greeting included a military flyover featuring a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and F-35 fighter jets. The display at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was a notable show of U.S. military power, as the B-2 bombers are the same type used in a recent strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The gesture occurred as the two leaders prepared for high-stakes discussions aimed at finding a resolution to the ongoing war in Ukraine, adding a layer of military symbolism to the diplomatic event.</p>

          <p>San Francisco chef Luke Sung has spoken out for the first time about a viral TikTok video that he says ruined his reputation and led to the closure of his restaurant, Kis Cafe. The controversy began when influencer Karla Marcotte posted a video describing a "nightmare" experience where she claimed Sung was rude and belittled her social media following. Sung offers a different account, stating he questioned if their audiences aligned after viewing her content. The intense social media backlash resulted in the restaurant's closure, though it has since reopened under a new name with his former partner.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted by a federal grand jury on corruption charges, making her the first mayor in the city's history to be charged with federal crimes while still in office.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi reported that nearly 200 arrests have been made in Washington, D.C., since the Trump administration federalized the city's police force to combat crime.

          <p>Shares of Salesforce increased by 4% following the news that activist hedge fund Starboard Value had substantially increased its ownership stake in the company. This development has fueled speculation on Wall Street that Salesforce may face a new round of investor pressure to improve its performance, similar to a successful activist campaign in 2022-2023 that led to a significant stock turnaround. Investors are now watching to see if this renewed activism will push the enterprise software company to refocus on core business growth and profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge in DeKalb County, Georgia, has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester arrested during demonstrations against Atlanta's new police and fire training center, widely known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state had violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to secure an indictment more than two and a half years after the arrest. This ruling represents a significant victory for opponents of the controversial facility, many of whom have faced sweeping and severe charges from the state.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals a critical failure in the U.S. healthcare system, showing that approximately one in ten children on Medicaid who seek emergency room care for a mental health crisis end up being held there for three or more days. This practice, known as boarding, is a direct result of a severe nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for young people. Healthcare experts warn that these extended stays in non-therapeutic ER environments can exacerbate a child's condition, highlighting an urgent need for increased mental health resources.</p>

The panel is tasked with providing recommendations to improve vaccine safety and oversight, marking the latest move by Kennedy to scrutinize the nation's childhood immunization schedule.</p>

          <p>Emerging research suggests that cloves, a spice frequently used in baking and cooking, may offer significant health benefits beyond their flavor. Studies indicate that the active compound in cloves, eugenol, possesses antimicrobial properties that can help combat harmful bacteria in the mouth and improve gum health. Furthermore, some research has shown that clove extract can help lower blood sugar levels after meals, adding to the spice's traditional use in medicine as a source of minerals and antioxidants.</p>

          <p>The Social Security program, a cornerstone of retirement for nearly 70 million Americans, has just marked its 90th anniversary. Despite its critical role, the program is facing increasing financial pressure, with its trust funds projected to be depleted by 2034 as benefit payments continue to exceed revenues. If Congress does not intervene to address this long-term funding gap, future retirees could see their benefits automatically reduced by as much as 23%, a prospect that has eroded public confidence in the system's future.

This legal action is a direct response to President Trump's executive order, which invoked emergency powers to place the local police force under federal control for 30 days.</p>

Conversely, taxpayers in states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest benefits, with the analysis also noting that high-income earners in wealthy areas will gain disproportionately.
