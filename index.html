          <p>A speech given by a Chinese Harvard graduate has sparked controversy, highlighting public disillusionment with elite education and anger at class rigidity in China. The initial praise for the graduate's success quickly turned to criticism on social media, with users questioning whether her privileged background truly represented the broader Chinese student population. Anthropologist Yuan Changgeng notes that social classes in China have become increasingly rigid, with tensions on the rise. People are recognizing that educational competition is often a competition of family finances and social capital, where wealthy families have access to more educational resources. The article sheds light on the growing awareness of inequality in educational opportunities within China.</p>

          <p>Right-wing populists across Europe are collaborating to promote their narratives and establish an international alliance, emboldened by Donald Trump's reelection and recent electoral successes. Leaders gathered in Budapest for CPAC Hungary 2025, expressing concerns about national sovereignty and what they perceive as "gender and woke madness." Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged conservatives to win elections and take back Brussels. Institutions funded by the Hungarian government, such as the Danube Institute and the Center for Fundamental Rights, play a central role in these networks, organizing events and running media outlets across Europe. The rise of these networks is intended to influence European politics and ensure the survival of regimes like Orban's.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on Thursday amid an ongoing dispute over a temporary deal aimed at easing tariff escalations between the U.S. and China. Under the May 12 truce, the U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, and China reduced levies on American imports, however, talks have since stalled. Trump accused China of violating the deal, with U.S. officials claiming China is withholding certain products, including rare earth minerals. China, in turn, stated that the U.S. is undermining the deal by imposing new export control guidelines on AI chips and planning to revoke Chinese student visas. The conversation aimed to resolve these issues.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, at the request of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, although experts argue that concerns are largely unfounded and fueled by biased reports. Mifepristone was initially approved by the FDA in 2000 after a comprehensive review determined its safety and effectiveness, and periodic reviews since then have not revealed new safety concerns. The review comes after the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the pill's availability in 2024, preserving access to the drug.</p>

Harvard has vowed to fight back against these measures, which it views as a violation of its rights.

          <p>Japan has initiated a review of its rice policy in response to soaring grain prices, aiming to increase production and prevent supply shortages. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to ensure stable rice supplies, as prices have doubled over the past year, leading to the release of government stockpiles to curb the surge. The government is examining why the price uptrend has persisted and exploring potential responses, given that small fluctuations in rice harvests can lead to significant price swings. The meeting also addressed concerns about the declining number of rice farmers and the need for a safety net to support farmers vulnerable to price fluctuations.</p>

The ECB now anticipates inflation to average 2% in 2025, compared to a previous forecast of 2.3%.

          <p>The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in China is expected to mitigate a future labor shortage, but analysts have differing views on its near-term impact on deflationary pressures. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest that AI could worsen deflationary pressures by disrupting the employment market, especially given China's existing high youth unemployment. They believe companies might prioritize AI adoption over hiring, leading to wage deceleration. However, Standard Chartered's Ding Shuang argues that AI is not a primary driver of deflation, citing overcapacity in some industries and sluggish domestic demand as the main causes.

International students make up a significant portion of Harvard's student body, and the move is seen as an attempt to apply "America First" principles to higher education. The restriction could harm universities beyond Harvard and negatively impact American research and innovation, particularly after the Great Recession when colleges relied on international students to bolster finances.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has reduced its key interest rate for the eighth time in just over a year, citing concerns about continuing pressure on the eurozone from Donald Trump's tariffs. The main rate has been lowered from 2.25% to 2% as the ECB warned about the impact of trade uncertainty on business investment and exports. While inflation has eased, the economy has been sluggish even before the US president rolled out his aggressive tariff policy. The ECB anticipates that stronger-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter may weaken as the year progresses.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff proposals could significantly impact the price of goods like clothing and shoes, potentially increasing costs for U.S. consumers.

Under current tariffs, prices could rise by about 19% for goods from China and 8% for goods from Vietnam. The models assume retailers pass along the tariffs to shoppers in the form of higher prices, but retailers may use strategies to offset some of the cost.</p>
