          <p>Devastating flash floods and landslides in northwest Pakistan have resulted in over 220 deaths in a 48-hour period, adding to a total of more than 540 fatalities since late June. The severe monsoon rainfall has destroyed dozens of homes, with rescue operations underway to find survivors in the hardest-hit villages. This disaster follows Pakistan's worst-ever monsoon season in 2022, highlighting the increasing threat of extreme weather events, which experts link to climate change.</p>

          <p>A recent meeting in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, described by both leaders as "productive," is being analyzed for its potential impact on global geopolitics, particularly concerning China. While the summit did not result in a concrete ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine, the diplomatic engagement itself is seen as a symbolic victory for Moscow. Observers are now considering how this potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations might create a complex strategic dilemma for Beijing, altering the dynamics between the three major powers.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Devon and Cornwall have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit for a limited-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. The police successfully argued in court that the funds were derived from tax evasion and money laundering, obtaining forfeiture orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously confiscated from Tate and his brother for unpaid taxes on revenue from their online businesses.</p>

          <p>Tom Artiom Alexandrovich, an executive director of the Israel Cyber Directorate, was arrested in Nevada as part of an undercover police sting targeting individuals seeking to sexually prey on children online. He faces a felony charge for luring a child with a computer for a sex act, though he has reportedly returned to Israel after being released from custody. The Israeli Prime Minister's office initially downplayed the incident, stating the employee was only "questioned" and not arrested, despite police reports confirming his detainment along with seven other suspects.</p>

          <p>A new wave of book removals is sweeping through Florida schools, with hundreds of titles being pulled from shelves in response to pressure from the state's board of education. After one district was threatened with legal action over allegedly "pornographic" titles, several other districts have proactively removed books to avoid similar government retaliation. Critics, including PEN America, describe the actions as "state-driven censorship" aimed at erasing LGBTQ+ voices and honest discussions of race and sex from public education.</p>

The initiative aims to level the playing field, ensuring these students feel prepared and equal to their peers, thereby addressing a critical support gap and helping them focus on their academic success.</p>

Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had met all four markers, less than a quarter have done so today. The study attributes this shift to economic barriers, including rising costs of living, alongside changing societal norms that increasingly prioritize educational attainment and financial stability before family formation.</p>

These practices help build resilience by teaching your body and mind that you can tolerate discomfort and emerge stronger.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is recruiting older, well-known former officeholders for critical 2026 Senate races, such as Sherrod Brown in Ohio and former Governor Roy Cooper in North Carolina. This strategy prioritizes electability and name recognition in challenging states over the party's broader goal of elevating a new generation of leaders. While some activists see this as a "damning indictment" of the party's failure to build a strong bench, strategists argue that these proven winners offer the best chance to compete in tough political landscapes.</p>

          <p>With the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima approaching, the last generation of survivors, known as "hibakusha," are making a final, urgent plea for global peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons. Their message comes as an intensifying arms race unfolds in East Asia, with nuclear powers expanding their arsenals, making their call for disarmament more critical than ever. Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the survivors' organization, Nihon Hidankyo, faces an uphill battle as geopolitical tensions undermine the "nuclear taboo."</p>

          <p>The personal data of up to 3,700 Afghans who were relocated to the United Kingdom has been potentially compromised in a cyber-security incident involving a Ministry of Defence subcontractor. The breach exposed names, passport details, and information related to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) for individuals who arrived between January and March 2024. This incident follows a previous major data leak in 2022, raising further concerns about the security of sensitive information for Afghans who assisted British forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Buy now, pay later" services like Afterpay and Klarna are increasingly popular, particularly among young women, and are being marketed with language that frames debt as "cute" and manageable. These services allow consumers to split purchases into smaller, interest-free installments, but can lead to significant late fees and damaged credit if payments are missed. Critics argue this trend normalizes debt for everyday purchases and uses targeted, gendered advertising to encourage overspending, creating a gateway to more serious financial struggles for a new generation of consumers.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without any public agreements on a ceasefire or a path to peace in Ukraine. While Trump described the meeting as "extremely productive," the lack of tangible outcomes has led many analysts to view the event as a symbolic victory for Putin, who was received with full diplomatic honors. The talks primarily served to rehabilitate the Russian leader on the world stage without requiring him to make any significant concessions regarding the ongoing war.</p>

This technological advancement reflects the changing nature of the battlefield, where long-range, precision-strike capabilities are becoming increasingly crucial for success.</p>

          <p>Hundreds gathered for a vigil in Monrovia, California, to honor Carlos Roberto Montoya, a Guatemalan day laborer who was struck and killed by a vehicle while running onto a freeway to flee an immigration raid.

The Department of Homeland Security stated that Montoya was not being actively pursued at the time of his death, a claim disputed by those who knew him.</p>

          <p>A great horned owl in Orange County was rescued after becoming entangled in a glue trap, a device intended for rodents that often harms non-target wildlife. Although a well-meaning person freed the bird by cutting its feathers, this has severely hampered its ability to fly, and it may take over a year for them to regrow. Wildlife rehabilitators are caring for the owl and using the incident to warn the public about the indiscriminate and inhumane nature of glue traps, which cause slow and painful deaths for many animals.</p>

With rising costs and a lack of affordable options, they are partnering with developers and even building their own housing to prevent their vulnerable clients from ending up on the streets.</p>
