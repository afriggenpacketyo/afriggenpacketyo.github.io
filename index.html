          <p>A Connecticut law permitting towing companies to sell towed vehicles after only 15 days is drawing criticism for its predatory nature. Residents in working-class neighborhoods report being targeted by companies like MyHoopty.com LLC, which can seize cars for minor infractions like expired registrations. Affected individuals, like Paul Boudreau and Greta Blau, lost their vehicle because they couldn't afford the high fees on short notice, highlighting how the law disproportionately impacts low-income people. The company owner defends the practice as simple enforcement of apartment complex rules.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California, has become the state's largest wildfire of the year, scorching over 70,800 acres. With only 10% containment, the blaze threatens approximately 50 structures and has forced over 200 residents to evacuate. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, the fire's cause is currently under investigation by a unified command of state, federal, and local agencies. Over 600 personnel, along with numerous fire engines and air tankers, are actively working to control the rapidly spreading wildfire.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a comprehensive tax and spending package into law, making his 2017 tax cuts permanent while implementing significant spending reductions in federal safety-net programs. The legislation, which passed Congress by a narrow margin, also allocates major funding for border security and defense. Critics, primarily Democrats, have raised concerns over projected increases to the national debt by an estimated $3 trillion and the potential for millions to lose health insurance coverage. The White House celebrated the signing as a historic achievement for the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe flooding along the Guadalupe River in central Texas has led to at least 13 deaths, with children among the victims. More than 20 campers from Camp Mystic, a local summer camp, remain unaccounted for following the deluge. In response, state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA, have been activated to conduct extensive rescue operations using helicopters, drones, and water rescue teams. Officials are working to locate those stranded by the rapidly rising floodwaters, which have devastated several camps in the area.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's new tax bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits but instead introduces a new temporary deduction. The legislation creates a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below certain thresholds, which can lower their overall taxable income. Policy experts note this is different from a full repeal of the tax on benefits and that the relief primarily benefits higher-income seniors. Concerns have also been raised that the measure could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that zooplankton, tiny marine animals, play a surprisingly significant role in mitigating global warming through a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. Researchers estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a much larger amount than previously thought. This discovery highlights the crucial but often overlooked role of these organisms in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally delivered what it calls a "positive response" to the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal, signaling it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official clarified that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The U.S. and Israel, which have been reluctant to accept similar demands in the past, have not yet issued a formal response to the group's position.</p>

The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt, and lean proteins to foster long-term wellness.</p>
