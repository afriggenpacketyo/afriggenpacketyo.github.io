          <p>Former LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne humorously responded to a social media user who mocked a viral photo of her with sweaty armpits. The picture was taken while she was anxiously watching her boyfriend, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes, play against the Cincinnati Reds. When a TikTok user commented, "You pit the ‘pit’ in Pittsburgh," Dunne quipped back, "You’d break a sweat too being a Pirates fan." Her reply references the team's recent struggles, as they have not reached the playoffs since 2015, adding a layer of witty self-awareness to her comeback.</p>

          <p>The German government is planning to initiate direct negotiations with the Taliban to establish a formal process for deporting Afghan nationals convicted of crimes or considered security threats. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that ministry officials will travel to Kabul in October to finalize an agreement, aiming to use commercial flights for regular repatriations. This move is part of a broader German policy to manage immigration and security, which also includes similar deportation discussions with Syria. The policy has drawn criticism from human rights groups who argue that Afghanistan is unsafe under Taliban rule.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market saw a turbulent week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ending with minor losses despite early record highs. Investor focus was on mixed economic signals, including a drop in jobless claims and a strong revision of Q2 GDP, which tempered expectations for further Federal Reserve rate cuts. A major market event was Nvidia's announcement of a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to build AI data centers, signaling the long-term potential of the artificial intelligence sector. Other notable company news included strong iPhone 17 sales boosting Apple and the FAA loosening delivery restrictions for Boeing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain (ILR) as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, would require legal migrants to reapply for visas under stricter rules and could lead to deportations. Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer distinguished between removing illegal migrants and targeting those lawfully settled, arguing the latter would "rip this country apart." He suggested that Reform's supporters are not racist but are frustrated with years of Conservative governance, appealing for party unity to counter their growing influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 1960s British band The Zombies are finally receiving widespread recognition decades after their initial success, a journey detailed in a recent profile. The band's first hit, "She's Not There," topped charts in 1964, but sustained success proved elusive, leading them to break up before their album "Odessey and Oracle" became a cult classic. A track from that album, "Time of the Season," unexpectedly became a major hit a full year after its release, solidifying their legacy. Now, over 50 years later, the surviving members have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, celebrating their influential and timeless music.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has directed the Secretary of Defense to deploy troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal facilities from perceived threats, authorizing the use of "Full Force." The move was immediately met with strong condemnation from local and state officials, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, who stated there is "no need for military troops in our city." Portland's mayor and police chief also pushed back, asserting that recent protests have been peaceful and that a federal presence would be counterproductive, drawing parallels to the inflammatory effects of a similar deployment in 2020.</p>

          <p>Amid growing skepticism of official government statistics, alternative data sets are being used to get a more accurate picture of inflation.

Alternative sources like the Truflation Price Index, Adobe Digital Price Index, and Zillow Rent Index currently suggest consumer prices may be lower than official figures indicate. However, forward-looking data from business organizations like the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) suggest that inflationary pressures persist, pointing to potential price increases in the coming months.

          <p>China is developing an industrial 'pull' system to mass-produce rockets and satellites, modeling its approach on modern automotive manufacturing. This method aims to create space systems with consistent quality, lower costs, and greater flexibility by having final assembly 'pull' components from suppliers only when needed. This contrasts with the traditional 'push' system, which relies on forecasts and often leads to delays and excess inventory. As global space activity is projected to grow exponentially, Chinese researchers believe mastering this scalable production model will be key to dominating the future of the space industry.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in U.S. shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national shopping center vacancy rate increasing, landlords are becoming more flexible, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to negotiate favorable rents and lease terms in previously unaffordable locations. This trend is helping to revitalize commercial corridors by replacing cookie-cutter chains with unique local enterprises that can create a distinct community experience. Experts note this shift allows entrepreneurs to test physical locations without significant financial risk, fostering local economic regeneration.</p>

This marks Dominion's third major settlement related to 2020 election lies, following a $787.5 million agreement with Fox News and a $67 million settlement with Newsmax.

          <p>China's new Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, is reportedly preparing for its first sea trials, sparking speculation about its advanced capabilities. Recent photos show the removal of covers from its electromagnetic catapult system, suggesting it is the world's first dedicated drone carrier. This vessel is considered a key asset for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's unmanned aerial vehicle operations. Amphibious assault ships are expected to be crucial in any potential conflict over Taiwan, and the Type 076 could significantly expand the operational range and power of Chinese naval strike groups.</p>

          <p>An expert who helps Americans move abroad has identified several common misconceptions about the expatriate lifestyle. One major myth is that living overseas is always cheap; in reality, costs, particularly for housing, are rising globally. Another is the fear that Americans are not welcome, when in fact anti-tourism sentiment is often about affordable housing shortages, not individuals. Other debunked beliefs include the idea that you will inevitably be lonely, that life abroad is perfect without challenges like bureaucracy, and that it's too late in life to make such a significant move.</p>

Critics point to the interconnected nature of the deals, where partners like Nvidia invest in OpenAI and then receive large orders from them, as reminiscent of the vendor financing patterns seen before the dot-com bubble. OpenAI's leadership defends the strategy, arguing that such bold infrastructure bets are necessary to lead the AI revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rate of civilian fire deaths in the United States has dramatically decreased by approximately two-thirds since 1980, showcasing significant progress in urban safety. This reduction is attributed to an accumulation of small but crucial improvements in technology and regulation. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, the increased installation of automatic sprinkler systems, and the implementation of safer standards for furniture and electrical wiring. Additionally, a significant decline in cigarette smoking and the requirement for "fire-safe" cigarettes have drastically reduced the number of smoking-related home fires, saving countless lives.</p>

Supporters argue it will streamline online bureaucratic processes, while opponents maintain fears that it could undermine privacy and be used for tracking.
