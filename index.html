          <p>Apollo, a U.S. private capital firm, is set to provide a Â£4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, addressing a funding shortfall. The loan, structured as an investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package, will carry an interest rate below 7%. This deal marks one of the largest private capital investments in a UK national interest project. While Apollo and EDF, the majority owner of Hinkley Point, have declined to comment, sources indicate that Apollo has been in discussions with EDF for several weeks regarding this opportunity. </p>

          <p>Despite recent escalations between Israel and Iran, the Trump administration is signaling a willingness to pursue a diplomatic solution with Iran. Officials are framing the President's two-week timeline as an opportunity for Iran to "come to their senses." Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff has been in communication with Iranâ€™s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, though no meetings are currently planned. European diplomats are also scheduled to hold talks with Araghchi in Geneva. The administration cites heavy losses in Iran's senior leadership as a reason for allowing diplomatic space. </p>

British Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the situation as "perilous" and emphasized the importance of achieving a diplomatic solution within the next two weeks.

          <p>The People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, has cautioned against an "addiction" to blind card packs and blind boxes among the country's youth. The newspaper called for strict identity verification to curb the "out-of-control consumption" of these items by minors, arguing that the allure of "unknown surprises" hides "commercial traps" that induce impulsive spending. This warning reflects regulations enacted four years ago to prevent online gaming addiction among teenagers. The purchase of blind boxes carries an element of gambling, augmented by varied designs and rarity levels, fueling the desire to collect entire sets. </p>

Government borrowing also hit the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993, reaching Â£17.7bn.

          <p>The United States is again weighing military force against a Middle Eastern country, this time Iran, raising concerns of repeating past mistakes. The author argues that Israel's recent attack on Iran aimed to preempt American diplomacy and cripple the Islamic Republic. Even if Iran were developing a nuclear weapon, the threat should not be inflated, and war is not the answer. Stepping back from the brink could open new possibilities for the U.S. to focus on domestic issues and end its involvement in Middle East conflicts. </p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully tested artillery-launched drones capable of withstanding the extreme forces inside a cannon. The drones can survive launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight. This advance centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism co-developed by the Shaanxi Applied Physics and Chemistry Research Institute, the Chinese air force, and defense contractor Norinco. The drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, multiply flight range, significantly save power consumption and extend loiter time.</p>

          <p>Michael Hiltzik analyzes the annual Social Security and Medicare trustees' reports, highlighting potential misunderstandings and threats to the programs. While the reports project potential benefit cuts in the 2030s, Hiltzik argues that the Trump administration's immigration, taxation, and tariff policies pose a more immediate threat. He notes that these policies could weaken the country's economic outlook and Social Security's financial footing. The analysis also discusses the impact of rising economic inequality on Social Security revenues and proposes potential solutions, such as eliminating the cap on wages subject to payroll tax.
