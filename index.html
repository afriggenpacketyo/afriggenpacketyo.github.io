          <p>Dozens of Texas House Democrats have stayed out of the state for a second week to prevent a quorum, thereby blocking a vote on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to call continuous special sessions and have the lawmakers arrested upon their return. In response, Democrats are mobilizing national support, with former Attorney General Eric Holder scheduled to speak with U.S. House Democrats. The standoff highlights a contentious national battle over redistricting, with other states also considering similar mid-decade map changes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, stating he will try to regain territory for the country. Trump mentioned the possibility of "some swapping, changes in land," a concept that has raised concerns as Kyiv has never claimed Russian territory. He indicated he would speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before and after the talks, but also expressed disagreement with Zelensky's actions. Zelensky has previously stated that any agreements made without Ukraine's involvement would be considered "dead decisions."</p>

          <p>Residents of Poplar, North Carolina, are engaged in a legal battle against an allegedly unauthorized mining operation they claim is polluting their community, which is still recovering from Hurricane Helene. The North Carolina Department of Labor has determined the mine, operated by Horizon 30, LLC, is violating state laws, and the Justice Department is seeking an injunction. Locals argue the company is exploiting the post-hurricane situation, causing environmental damage and health issues, such as silica dust pollution. The company has continued to operate despite multiple warnings and lacks the necessary state permits.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's shares increased after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, signaling a potential recovery. The movie theater chain narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million from $32.8 million a year prior, with revenue climbing 35% to nearly $1.4 billion. CEO Adam Aron attributed the performance to a recovering box office and a 26% rise in attendance, noting that the company has successfully addressed its 2026 debt maturities. The company also saw record revenue per patron, driven by growth in its premium offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally after reports that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III could ease tax burdens and encourage institutional investment in the cannabis industry. Trump confirmed he is looking into the matter and will make a determination soon. While the final authority rests with the Attorney General, industry leaders and analysts view the potential change as a bipartisan-supported "gamechanger" for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

While only about 163,000 U.S. households still used dial-up in 2023, the service's distinctive connection sound and "You've Got Mail" greeting are iconic symbols of the 1990s internet era. The change will not affect free AOL email accounts or other existing services.</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $5 billion to overhaul its electric vehicle production, including a $2 billion modernization of its Louisville plant and a $3 billion new battery facility in Michigan. The initiative aims to produce more affordable EVs, with the first model, a midsize electric truck, slated for a 2027 debut at a starting price of $30,000. Ford's new "universal EV platform" features an innovative "assembly tree" structure designed to be more efficient and ergonomic. This strategy seeks to lower costs by using fewer components and smaller, cobalt-free batteries, positioning Ford to compete with global rivals.</p>

          <p>This article explores the differences between Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities as tools for retirement planning. IRAs, including traditional and Roth versions, are tax-advantaged investment accounts offering growth potential and flexibility, making them suitable for younger savers. Annuities, conversely, provide a guaranteed income stream, appealing to those nearing retirement who prioritize security over market growth. The article suggests that a hybrid approach, using an IRA for wealth accumulation and then converting a portion to an annuity for a stable income floor, can be an effective strategy for many.

For the chipmakers, the deal is seen as a net positive as it secures access to the lucrative Chinese market, with 85% of revenue being better than none.

Kent Police responded to reports of an altercation on Sunday evening, where the man was found with serious injuries and pronounced dead at the scene. A 16-year-old girl and two boys, aged 14 and 15, were taken into custody. The incident has shocked the quiet coastal community, which has a population of just under 1,000 people.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has invited U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte to a virtual meeting. The discussion is scheduled ahead of Trump's planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which has raised concerns among European allies. The EU's foreign policy chief emphasized the need for transatlantic unity and reiterated that any path to peace must involve Ukraine. The German-led meeting aims to coordinate on pressuring Russia and preparing for potential peace negotiations amid fears of a bilateral U.S.-Russia deal.</p>

          <p>MTailor, a clothing app that uses a phone's camera to take body measurements for custom-fit garments, has achieved significant success despite a confrontational appearance on "Shark Tank" and rejecting investment offers. Co-founded by Miles Penn, the company utilizes technology claimed to be more accurate than a human tailor. Since its 2014 launch, the company has raised millions in venture capital and reported $13 million in yearly sales as of April 2024. The app maintains high ratings, demonstrating that a failed pitch on the show does not preclude long-term business success.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. automakers are re-evaluating their electric vehicle strategies following the Trump administration's moves to eliminate EV subsidies and federal emissions standards. With the $7,500 EV tax credit set to expire, companies are adjusting their production and sales forecasts. Tesla's Elon Musk anticipates a few "rough quarters," while GM expects short-term headwinds but minimal impact on 2025 results. Ford is pivoting to more affordable EVs and has altered spending, while Rivian has lowered its revenue outlook due to the loss of regulatory credit sales, a key income source for EV-only manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a revival by replacing vacant anchor stores with unconventional tenants like churches, entertainment venues, and community hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly and drives traffic to remaining retailers. Mall owners like CBL Properties and Brookfield Properties are subdividing large spaces for a mix of tenants, including restaurants, hotels, and experiential attractions. This strategy is increasing foot traffic and creating a "cross-shopping" effect, breathing new life into once-dying suburban centers.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower is set to reach its peak, offering a potentially dazzling display of shooting stars. The shower, caused by debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet, is best viewed after midnight, but this year's peak coincides with a bright Sturgeon Moon, which will likely obscure fainter meteors. For optimal viewing, experts recommend finding a location away from city lights with a clear view of the sky and allowing at least 20 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darkness. Despite the moonlight, brighter fireballs should still be visible to patient stargazers.</p>

Beginning in 2026, all UFC events will be streamed on Paramount+ without additional pay-per-view fees, a significant shift from the previous model. The deal, which gives Paramount 43 live events annually, is a strategic move by new CEO David Ellison to secure scarce, high-value sports content that drives subscriptions year-round.

          <p>The Trump administration's justification for federalizing Washington D.C.'s police force was immediately undermined by its own FBI Director. Moments after President Trump cited a crime emergency as the reason for the takeover, FBI Director Kash Patel announced that the U.S. homicide rate is on track to be the lowest in history. This directly contradicts the administration's narrative of an out-of-control crime wave in the capital, where violent crime has been declining since 2023. The conflicting statements highlight a disconnect in the administration's rationale for its unprecedented action against the city's autonomy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has dismissed reports of Chinese national security concerns regarding Nvidia's H20 chips as "nonsense." His comments follow the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Cramer argued that the U.S. government could have blocked the sales if there were genuine, significant risks associated with the technology. This perspective suggests that the deal is primarily an economic and trade arrangement rather than a compromise on national security. (not investment advice)</p>
