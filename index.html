Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, pulled out just before their scheduled quarter-final match. Sabalenka will now face American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in a rematch of last year's final. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, showing strong form despite a challenging season leading up to the tournament.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has begun deliberations in the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of plotting a coup to remain in power after his 2022 election defeat. Prosecutors allege he was part of an "armed criminal association" aiming to overthrow the democratic order, culminating in his supporters storming government buildings in January 2023. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face a prison sentence of over 40 years. The case is being closely watched as a significant test for Brazil's democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has publicly released over 33,000 pages of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, which were provided by the Department of Justice. The release follows a subpoena issued by the committee, with the DOJ redacting victim identities and sensitive material. Democratic committee members have noted that a large portion of these files, around 97%, were already in the public domain. This development comes as the Trump administration faces pressure regarding its handling of the Epstein investigation materials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has recently claimed he ended six or seven major international conflicts, a statement examined by foreign policy experts. The White House identified conflicts including those between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and India and Pakistan. While experts credit the administration with helping broker some ceasefires and agreements, they note that several of these situations were not full-scale wars and many remain unresolved. The analysis suggests that while some diplomatic progress was made, the claim of having definitively "settled" these conflicts is an overstatement of the actual outcomes.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis of tax laws shows significant variation in take-home winnings by state. Winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest payouts after federal taxes. Conversely, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the smallest returns. The article also details the odds of winning and identifies the most and least frequently drawn numbers in recent games. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan in the UK for allegedly "inciting violence" through social media posts has intensified the debate over free speech in Europe. Linehan, a vocal critic of transgender activism, was arrested based on a post suggesting self-defense in certain situations. The article argues his arrest is symptomatic of a broader trend where illiberal hate-speech laws are selectively enforced, giving police discretionary power and creating a chilling effect on expression. It contrasts his case with instances where activists with opposing views faced no legal consequences for seemingly more direct rhetoric.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a "kinetic strike" in the Caribbean Sea, destroying a boat that originated from Venezuela and was allegedly transporting illegal narcotics. The operation resulted in the deaths of 11 individuals, whom the president referred to as "terrorists" and members of the Tren de Aragua crime group. This action occurs amid heightened tensions, following a recent U.S. naval buildup in the region aimed at combating drug trafficking. The Venezuelan government has previously characterized the U.S. military presence as a threat.</p>

          <p>Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, jumped 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling on its antitrust case. Investors reacted positively as the court declined to impose the harshest penalties sought by the Department of Justice, such as forcing the sale of the Chrome web browser. While Google must end certain exclusive contracts, the ruling was viewed as a significant win for the company, avoiding a structural breakup. The decision allows Google to maintain its core business structure while making some operational changes to increase competition. (not investment advice)</p>

Drawing parallels to his experiences in conflict zones like Baghdad, he warns that normalizing a military presence on American streets is a dangerous step for democracy and places soldiers in situations they are not equipped to handle.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing company founded by industry veteran Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects ongoing consolidation within the aircraft leasing sector. This industry has become increasingly powerful, owning over half of the world's passenger jets. The deal comes as high demand and aircraft shortages have pushed rental rates to record levels.

          <p>President Trump announced his administration will ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn a recent appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the authority to impose tariffs is a power vested exclusively in Congress. Trump argued that the tariffs are essential for the nation's financial stability and that losing them would be devastating for the country. The administration hopes for a quick decision from the high court to resolve the legal challenge to one of its key economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff have formally requested that the Department of Defense provide a detailed breakdown of the recent deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles. In a letter to the Defense Secretary, the California Democrats are seeking information on the specific missions, costs, and any law enforcement activities undertaken by the troops. The deployments, ordered by President Trump to support federal immigration operations, occurred over the objections of state and local officials. The request comes as a federal judge ruled the deployments were likely a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of employees at California's Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon national parks have voted overwhelmingly to form a union with the National Federation of Federal Employees. The vote includes about 600 workers, such as park rangers, scientists, and first responders. Organizers say support for unionization surged this year amid turmoil within the National Park Service under the Trump administration, which has enacted significant budget and staff cuts. The new union aims to provide a stronger voice for employees to address concerns about staffing levels, resources, and workplace protections.</p>
