          <p>Elon Musk is threatening legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store. He alleges that Apple's policies unfairly prevent his AI chatbot, Grok, from reaching the top rankings, favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT instead. This threat adds to Musk's ongoing feud with OpenAI, which he co-founded, and comes as Apple faces other antitrust challenges, including a major lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to extend their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the implementation of higher tariffs on each other's goods. Under the extension, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American products, providing more time for negotiations. The talks aim to address trade imbalances, market access, and national security issues, though the continued uncertainty is a concern for some businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

The central bank also downgraded its annual GDP growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker public demand and productivity. This monetary easing comes as inflation has substantially decreased, nearing the bank's target range, and amid a reshaped global trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The Spanish government also recently opted for European military aircraft over U.S.-made F-35s, drawing criticism from President Trump. Analysts suggest Spain's left-leaning government is willing to antagonize Washington, leveraging its EU membership for protection against direct trade repercussions while appealing to a domestic audience that is largely critical of Trump.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are being sued by a real estate developer and broker over a $240 million luxury housing project in Hawaii. The lawsuit alleges that Ohtani and Balelo, who were brought in for a promotional endorsement, used their celebrity leverage to demand concessions and ultimately had the plaintiffs fired from the project they conceived. The plaintiffs are accusing the duo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, claiming they stand to lose millions in compensation.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit, is stepping down to "become a founder again," with his departure effective at the end of the year. The leadership change comes as GitHub faces intensified competition in the AI-powered coding tool market from fast-growing startups like Cursor and Replit. While GitHub's AI tool, Copilot, continues to see growth, the competitive landscape for developer tools is rapidly evolving with new AI-native platforms gaining traction among engineers.</p>

This initiative contrasts with a recent fee increase for summiting Mount Everest, which will now cost $15,000 during peak season. Officials hope that making these less-frequented mountains free to climb will generate jobs and strengthen local economies, although questions remain about infrastructure and community readiness in these areas.</p>
