          <p>Danny Kruger, a Conservative Member of Parliament since 2019 and a member of Kemi Badenoch's shadow cabinet, has officially defected to the Reform UK party. At a press conference alongside Reform leader Nigel Farage, Kruger declared that the Conservative party is "over," marking a significant political shift. This move represents a notable blow to the Conservative party, highlighting internal fractures and the growing influence of Reform UK in the country's political landscape. Kruger's decision underscores a realignment within right-leaning politics in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has revealed that the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, comes from a conservative family but held a "very different" personal ideology. Investigators are exploring a possible motive, noting that the suspect's roommate is a person transitioning from male to female, though their relevance to the case remains undetermined. The governor also mentioned that Robinson was allegedly "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology" and frequented "dark places of the internet." Formal charges are expected to be filed soon, which may provide more clarity on the motive behind the attack.</p>

          <p>The trial of a former paratrooper, identified only as Soldier F, has commenced in Belfast for his alleged role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Londonderry. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder of two individuals, James Wray and William McKinney, and five counts of attempted murder. The non-jury trial follows a long campaign for justice by the victims' families, who marched to the courthouse before the proceedings began. The case centers on evidence from statements given by other soldiers at the time, with the admissibility of these statements being a key early decision for the judge.</p>

European markets saw gains, while Asian markets were varied amid ongoing concerns about China's slowing economy, which has been impacted by U.S. tariffs. Data from China indicated a slowdown in retail sales, prompting expectations of further domestic stimulus. The upcoming Fed decision is a focal point for investors, as a failure to cut rates could lead to market disappointment and a potential downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta acted arbitrarily and violated the freedom of expression of adult content actress Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as other accounts with similar content remained active, and failed to provide a clear justification for the closure. As a result, the court has ordered Meta to review and adjust Instagram's terms of use to ensure users are clearly informed about how to challenge content moderation decisions. This ruling adds to a growing trend of South American courts holding social media platforms accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem to address the significant international fallout from Israel's recent strike in Qatar. The attack, which targeted senior Hamas leaders, drew criticism from President Donald Trump and sparked outrage globally. The discussions are also expected to cover Israel's military plans for Gaza City and its controversial expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank.

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought the event's security protocols under intense scrutiny. Security experts have criticized the choice of an open-air venue surrounded by buildings with rooftop access, questioning the lack of metal detectors and bag checks for the public event. A gunman shot Kirk from a distance with a high-powered rifle, raising comparisons to the 2024 attempt on Donald Trump's life. Witnesses confirmed the apparent lack of security, while the university stated it had coordinated with Kirk's private security team, highlighting a debate over adequate protection for controversial public figures.</p>

The drive, called the National Voter Registration Week of Action, aims to reverse these trends by holding over 50 events across 27 states and territories.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation aimed at banning employers from using credit reports to vet job applicants.

Proponents state that poor credit is often linked to circumstances like medical debt or unemployment and does not correlate with job performance. The proposed law would prevent employers from requesting credit histories and stop credit agencies from providing them for employment purposes.</p>

While doctors say the lotion is likely harmless, they caution that it is not a proven medical treatment for sleep disorders.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to make a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom, an honor never before extended to a U.S. president. The visit, initiated by an invitation from King Charles via Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is seen by the British government as a key diplomatic opportunity to leverage Trump's known admiration for the royal family. Analysts suggest the UK is using its "soft power" to influence the president on critical issues like continued support for Ukraine. Despite Trump's unpopularity in the UK, the visit underscores the strategic importance of the personal relationship in international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>An unusually high number of U.S. lawmakers, currently 10 senators and 27 House members, have declared they will not run for their current seats in the 2026 election. The majority of those departing are Republicans, including prominent figures who have clashed with President Trump's political agenda. Many are retiring from public office, while others are seeking different positions, such as governor or a seat in the other congressional chamber. This trend signals a significant potential shift in the composition and dynamics of both the House and Senate ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The accelerated melting of glaciers in the Swiss Alps, driven by climate change, poses a severe threat to the future of Europe's most important rivers, including the Rhine, Rhône, and Danube. Glaciologists report that Swiss glaciers have lost a significant portion of their volume in recent years, with some, like the Rhône Glacier, losing several meters of ice thickness annually. These glaciers act as natural water towers, supplying crucial water flow during hot, dry summers. Their disappearance, projected to occur by the end of the century, will drastically alter river levels, impacting shipping, ecosystems, and water availability across the continent.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Defense Intelligence claims its special forces have successfully destroyed a Russian Buk-M3 surface-to-air missile system in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. This advanced defensive asset, valued at up to $50 million, is a significant loss for Russian forces. The report comes as Ukraine continues its strategy of targeting critical Russian infrastructure to disrupt military logistics and funding for the war. Meanwhile, a campaign group reported that cluster munitions have caused over 1,200 civilian casualties in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began, highlighting the ongoing human cost of the conflict.</p>

          <p>North Korea has formally stated that its position as a nuclear weapons state is now irreversible and permanently codified in its law. In a statement released through state media, officials asserted that international bodies like the IAEA have no right to interfere in what it considers an internal matter. The declaration coincided with the start of joint military drills between the United States, South Korea, and Japan, which Pyongyang condemned as a grave threat to its security. This hardline stance further entrenches North Korea's nuclear ambitions and complicates international efforts toward denuclearization on the Korean peninsula.</p>

The investigation targets general-purpose interface and gate driver chips made with mature 40nm and larger process nodes, which are commonly used in consumer and industrial applications. The move was prompted by a request from a Chinese semiconductor association, which claimed that prices for these U.S.-origin products have dropped significantly in 2024.

          <p>The UK government has announced that maternity services at fourteen NHS trusts in England will be examined as part of a rapid review into care failures. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the courage of bereaved families who have reported issues, some dating back over 15 years. However, some of these families have criticized the review as "not fit for purpose," demanding a full statutory public inquiry instead. The review, chaired by Baroness Amos, aims to understand why recommendations from previous inquiries have not led to sustained improvements and to address the disproportionately poor outcomes for Black and Asian families.</p>
