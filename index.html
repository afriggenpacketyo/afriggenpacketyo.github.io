          <h2>How Genetic Genealogy Is Being Used to Solve Decades-Old Cold Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 09:26:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The field of genetic genealogy, once a hobby for researching family trees, has become a powerful tool for law enforcement in solving cold cases. This article highlights the work of pioneer Barbara Rae-Venter, whose expertise helped investigators identify and capture the notorious Golden State Killer. By building family trees from DNA evidence found at crime scenes, researchers like Rae-Venter can narrow down suspect pools and provide crucial leads. The technique has since been used to solve numerous other long-unsolved crimes, including a nearly three-decade-old case of sexual assault in Ohio.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 09:25:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Senate committee report reveals the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report accuses former agency director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. The findings point to significant communication failures and a lack of formal processes for resource requests, which contributed to the security lapses on the day of the shooting. The investigation also notes that key personnel involved in the security breakdown were not among those recently disciplined.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, a maneuver that likely constitutes a historic autonomous satellite refueling mission. According to the US-based space awareness firm COMSPOC, the two probes were observed visually merged for several days after conducting a series of close-proximity operations. This technological feat, which the United States has not yet accomplished, demonstrates a significant advancement in China's space capabilities. The operation allows for extending the lifespan of satellites and has potential dual-use military applications, and was reportedly monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country has climbed to 129, with search and recovery operations still underway for missing individuals. Authorities have issued new warnings for a moderate risk of flash flooding in central Texas, including in the hard-hit areas of Kerrville and Burnet. Heavy rainfall is causing rapid river rises, with the Lampasas River rising over 22 feet in just two hours. Dozens of active and former Navy SEALs have volunteered to assist in the difficult search efforts, navigating miles of debris and destruction along the Guadalupe River.</p>

          <p>A new generation of sports media personalities, led by figures like Pat McAfee and Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy, has conquered a significant space in American culture, creating a powerful nexus of sports, entertainment, and right-wing politics. This article analyzes how these influencers, part of a broader "manosphere," have upended traditional media norms with a brash, unfiltered style that often denigrates women and "woke" culture. Their platforms have become essential stops for conservative figures, including Donald Trump, effectively normalizing right-wing ideas for a large, predominantly young male audience under the guise of apolitical sports talk.</p>

          <p>This profile explores the career and recent cultural resurgence of Pamela Anderson, arguing that her appeal goes far beyond her famous image from 'Baywatch' and Playboy. The article draws parallels to Marilyn Monroe, noting a sacrificial quality in how she has navigated public life, especially after the violation of her stolen private tape in the 1990s. Now at 58, Anderson is experiencing a renaissance, marked by a serious film role in 'The Last Showgirl' and a widely praised decision to stop wearing makeup. Her journey is framed as a triumph of personal strength and vulnerability over public exploitation.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric cars cheaper to purchase, aiming to encourage more drivers to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. While details are forthcoming, the move addresses the significant upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption. The announcement coincides with a new £25 million investment to help install curbside charging points for households without driveways. The policy is part of a broader strategy to meet the UK's 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was mapping other known cultural sites when their high-resolution sonar revealed the partially buried hull of a different vessel. The wreck is believed to be the L.W. Crane, a 90-foot wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880 while transporting passengers and freight. The unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, even in well-traveled waterways, and further investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The recent deadly flash floods in Texas, which have killed over 120 people, underscore a persistent pattern in the state's politics: a reluctance to invest in disaster preparedness despite being the most disaster-prone state in the U.S. This article explores how a political culture favoring rugged individualism and minimal government intervention has led to inaction on crucial infrastructure, from flood warning systems to power grid winterization. Despite repeated catastrophes like Hurricane Ike and winter storm Uri, Texas lawmakers often prioritize recovery spending over preventative measures, a stance influenced by the fossil fuel industry and a skepticism of climate change science.</p>

          <p>While the NFL has committed to sending players for flag football's debut in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Major League Baseball remains hesitant to allow its stars to participate. This article argues that MLB is missing a massive global marketing opportunity by not committing to what could be a "Dream Team"-level event for baseball. Despite top players like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge expressing a desire to play, logistical issues and the league's preference for its own World Baseball Classic appear to be holding up a decision. The author contends that forgoing the Olympics would be a short-sighted mistake for the sport's growth.</p>

          <p>The current season of 'Love Island USA' has distinguished itself by featuring a significant number of Black contestants, a notable shift in a genre that has historically centered whiteness. However, this article argues that while the show's casting has evolved, its willingness to engage with racial reality has not. The series has unceremoniously removed two different castmates after their past use of racial slurs resurfaced online, but explained their departures to the audience with vague references to "personal situations." This approach suggests a desire to decenter whiteness without actually grappling with the complexities and conflicts of race.</p>

          <p>An inmate has made an unusual escape from the Lyon-Corbas prison in southeastern France by hiding inside a bag belonging to a fellow inmate who was being released. Prison officials confirmed the escape and have launched an investigation into the security breach. The escaped prisoner was reportedly serving multiple sentences and was also under investigation for connections to organized crime. The incident has drawn further attention to the Lyon-Corbas prison, which is severely overcrowded, holding nearly double its intended capacity of inmates.</p>

          <p>Tensions have flared between China and Japan following a series of close encounters involving their military aircraft over the East China Sea last week. Japan's defense ministry accused a Chinese JH-7 fighter-bomber of making "unusual approaches" toward one of its electronic-intelligence planes, warning such actions could lead to an accidental collision. In response, China's defense ministry accused Japanese aircraft of repeatedly entering its air defense identification zone. Beijing described its actions as lawful and professional, blaming Japan's close-in reconnaissance for creating security risks in the contested maritime region.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco man's online purchase of a side table from Mexico resulted in an unexpected delivery-day charge of nearly $1,170 in U.S. customs fees, illustrating the direct impact of tariffs on consumers. The fee, levied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and collected by the delivery carrier, was in addition to the table's $1,980 price. As the Trump administration implements aggressive new tariff rates, consumers are increasingly facing such explicit costs on imported goods. Experts advise that while these charges are often legitimate, buyers should be cautious and verify any payment requests.</p>

          <p>A child being treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool has died after contracting measles, a death believed to be only the second in the UK in a decade. The hospital has seen a significant surge in seriously ill children with the highly contagious virus, treating 17 patients since June. Health officials attribute the spike in cases to a decline in measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake. In the north-west of England, vaccination rates are at 85%, well below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization to ensure community protection.</p>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, investigations continue to highlight systemic security breakdowns within the U.S. Secret Service. The attack, which killed fire chief Corey Comperatore, revealed failures in intelligence sharing and coordination. In response, the agency has outlined 37 reform measures, though many require congressional action and funding that has been slow to materialize. Experts trace some of the agency's challenges to its post-9/11 restructuring, which expanded its mission without a proportional increase in resources, leading to persistent staffing and operational strains that were flagged years before the incident.</p>

The incident, which saw Donald Trump survive with a wounded ear, galvanized his supporters, who framed his survival as divine intervention and a mandate to govern. The attack also occurred just eight days before then-President Joe Biden withdrew from the election, creating a devastating contrast between a defiant Trump and an ailing incumbent. This sequence of events is now seen as a pivotal moment that solidified Trump's path back to the White House and intensified the nation's political divisions.</p>

While James is still playing at a high level, his future with the Lakers is uncertain. The author posits that by announcing his retirement in advance, James could control his own narrative and receive a similarly fitting and magical send-off from the sport.</p>

          <p>The job market for the college class of 2025 is proving to be exceptionally difficult, with many graduates struggling to find work or settling for lower-than-expected salaries. Economists note that while overall unemployment is low, cautious employers and government downsizing have slowed hiring, creating fewer entry-level opportunities. This has led to a wider gap between salary expectations and actual offers. Career experts advise new graduates to be flexible in their job searches, as even a first job that isn't ideal can provide a valuable stepping stone to a more rewarding career.</p>

          <p>California is creating its first-ever cabinet-level agency dedicated exclusively to housing and homelessness, a move supporters say is long overdue for a state grappling with soaring housing costs. Governor Gavin Newsom's reorganization plan splits the unwieldy Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two entities. The new housing agency aims to streamline the state's complex and fragmented network of affordable housing funding programs. While the move elevates housing to the highest level of state government, critics question whether the bureaucratic shuffle will effectively tackle the high cost of construction and the root causes of the crisis.</p>
