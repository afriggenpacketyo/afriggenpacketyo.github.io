          <p>The Justice Department is intensifying its efforts to dismantle Google's advertising technology empire, arguing that the tech giant's dominance poses a significant threat to online publishers. During a recent hearing, government lawyers outlined a plan to force Google to divest tools used by publishers to sell ad space, as well as technology connecting publishers with advertisers. Google's legal team countered that such a breakup would contradict legal precedent and compromise privacy and security. The judge indicated that a hearing to determine remedies would be held in September, marking a critical phase in the ongoing antitrust battle that could reshape the tech landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of the "de minimis" exemption, ordered by President Trump, has led to increased prices for goods imported from China on shopping sites like Amazon, Temu, and Shein. This exemption previously allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but now these goods are subject to duties of up to 30%. Retailers are passing these increased costs onto consumers, and some businesses are already reporting a decline in U.S. orders. The change affects not only large retailers but also small to medium-sized businesses, potentially forcing them to close or diversify beyond the American market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent blackout in Spain and Portugal, theories have emerged suggesting that an oversupply of solar power was to blame; however, this claim remains unproven. While solar energy did account for a significant portion of the available power at the time, experts suggest the blackout was likely due to a system failure rather than solely a solar power issue. The incident has sparked debate about the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources into existing power grids, but experts emphasize that technical solutions are available to address these challenges and ensure grid stability.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plans for a $50 million research effort to determine the cause of autism are being met with skepticism from scientists in the field. Researchers are concerned about Kennedy's scientifically inaccurate statements about autism and the lack of consultation with experts. They also point out that federal funding for existing autism research is being cut, creating confusion and worry within the research community. The scientists emphasize the complexity of autism and the importance of studying both genetic and environmental factors.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has achieved significant success in recent local elections, indicating a potential shift in the British political landscape. The party has tapped into widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservative and Labour parties, gaining control of several councils and winning a by-election. Reform's success is particularly notable in areas that strongly supported Brexit, highlighting their appeal to voters who feel left behind by the mainstream parties. These results suggest that Reform could play a more prominent role in future elections.</p>
