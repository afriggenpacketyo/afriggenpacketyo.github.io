          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 11:00:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, Chairman Jerome Powell, and the Fed's Board of Governors to block her attempted dismissal from the central bank. Trump announced Cook's termination citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which he described as "deceitful and potentially criminal." Cook's legal team argues that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 permits removal only "for cause," which they define as malfeasance related to official conduct, not unsubstantiated private allegations. This legal challenge underscores a broader dispute over the Fed's independence in setting interest rates, as Trump has repeatedly pressured the central bank to lower them. The suit seeks to confirm Cook's status and safeguard the Board's congressionally mandated autonomy.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police special constable, James Bubb, who now identifies as Gwyn Samuels, has been convicted of multiple sexual assault offenses involving a child and another woman. Bubb reportedly groomed one of his victims online before sexually assaulting her at the age of 12, and was also found guilty of sexually assaulting an adult woman he met online while falsely presenting as a 16-year-old girl. The court heard how Bubb allegedly used his perceived authority and "police training techniques" to exert control. This disturbing case highlights a severe breach of public trust by an officer and raises significant concerns about the safety of online interactions for children. The NSPCC emphasized the vital need for comprehensive support for the victims to help them move forward.</p>

          <p>Credit card debt has reached $1.21 trillion, nearing an all-time high, with a new survey indicating that debt struggles are increasingly affecting consumers across all income levels, not just lower-income households. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling reports a rise in "negative debt behaviors," such as making less than minimum payments or consolidating debt into personal loans, with these trends observed similarly among high-income earners. Experts attribute this widespread strain to a combination of sustained high interest rates, persistent inflation, and a worsening employment environment. The article suggests that many consumers have reached a "tipping point" where interest expenses exceed their ability to pay, leading to growing financial concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenyan President William Ruto has sparked political controversy by publicly accusing Members of Parliament of taking bribes, a claim made as a new National Ethics and Corruption Survey highlighted the pervasive nature of graft in the country. The survey indicated that citizens frequently resort to bribery for basic services, with most cases going unreported despite a decline in average bribe amounts. While Ruto's critics demand proof, his supporters view the remarks as a necessary exposure of a long-standing issue. The article notes that Kenya loses billions annually to corruption, hindering development, and experts emphasize the need for consistent enforcement and transparency over new laws to rebuild public trust.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about the "AI revolution" and projected massive infrastructure spending, potentially reaching $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the decade's end. However, the company faces significant geopolitical hurdles, including a Trump administration block on its H20 chip sales to China and an unfinalized deal to restart sales, leaving billions in potential revenue uncertain. Analysts acknowledge solid growth but note the persistent "noise" surrounding China's impact on Nvidia's outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone attack targeted Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulting in at least 15 deaths, including four children, and injuring 48 others. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched hundreds of drones and missiles across the country, with many civilian buildings and even the EU Delegation to Ukraine's office sustaining damage. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians" and called for a firm global response and new sanctions against Russia. The attack, one of the largest since the 2022 invasion, occurred amid struggling U.S.-led peace efforts and President Trump's recent diplomatic push to end the conflict, with Moscow denying civilian targeting.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers are actively participating in the decennial New York City Trees Count, a census of the urban forest that involves volunteers quantifying and classifying park trees. This effort builds on previous censuses, which have evolved to include an app-supported interactive database of street and park trees. While Lidar technology will map street trees, human volunteers are crucial for assessing the health and diversity of 150,000 landscaped park trees. The data collected will inform city initiatives, such as increasing canopy cover and mitigating "heat burden" in underserved neighborhoods. The article highlights the census's role in fostering community engagement and tracking progress in expanding tree diversity and resilience against environmental threats.</p>

          <p>Defense ministers from Germany, France, and Spain are scheduled to meet in October to resolve impasses in the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) fighter jet program, estimated to cost over 100 billion euros. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius stressed the urgency, stating they are "damned to succeed" and must identify solutions to ongoing setbacks, primarily attributed by Berlin to French industry's demands for sole leadership. The article notes that France's Dassault Aviation, responsible for the core fighter, seeks an 80% work-share, creating friction with partners Airbus and Indra. A decision on launching the second development phase is expected in the fourth quarter, with Spain reaffirming its commitment to the essential project.</p>

          <p>Christopher Barbour, an Alabama death row inmate convicted in 1992 for murder, has been granted a new trial by a federal judge after 31 years, following new forensic tests. DNA evidence from the victim's body now links her neighbor, who is currently incarcerated for an unrelated murder, to the crime. Barbour's confession, a key part of the original case, is now challenged by his claims of police coercion and the new DNA findings, which an earlier forensics report had excluded him from. Chief U.S. District Judge Emily C. Marks ruled that prosecutors violated Barbour's constitutional rights by withholding crucial exculpatory evidence. The state plans to appeal the decision, but Barbour will now have the opportunity to argue his innocence to a jury.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a robust 3.3% annualized rate in the second quarter, a higher figure than initially estimated, demonstrating resilience against tariff volatility. This upward revision in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was primarily driven by stronger consumer spending and business activity. Notably, "final sales to private domestic purchasers," a key indicator for Federal Reserve officials, also saw a significant jump. The article highlights the unusual impact of tariffs, with a sharp decline in imports boosting the GDP figure, and notes that for the first half of the year, growth averaged around 2.1%. Experts suggest the economy is likely to continue at a slower, but stable, pace going forward. (not investment advice)</p>

The article cautions against the historical ineffectiveness of supply-side strategies, especially for synthetic drugs like fentanyl, which are difficult to interdict due to their production methods.

The article argues that cash bail is biased against racial minorities and the economically disadvantaged, leading to disproportionate incarceration for minor charges.

          <p>Pat Scallen, a bystander, recounted the horrific aftermath of the Minneapolis church shooting, rushing to Annunciation Catholic School where he found children suffering emotional and physical wounds. He described seeing a boy and a girl shot in the head, and a girl shot in the neck, with one child asking him, "Please just hold my hand." Two children, aged 8 and 10, were killed, and 17 others injured, including 14 children and three parishioners in their 80s. While all injured are expected to survive, the article emphasizes the profound trauma. The shooter, Robin Westman, died by suicide, and the FBI is investigating the incident as domestic terrorism and a hate crime.</p>
