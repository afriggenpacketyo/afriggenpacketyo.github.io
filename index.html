          <p>A shooting near the Emory University campus and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta resulted in the deaths of a police officer and the suspected gunman. The incident prompted a large-scale law enforcement response and a temporary shelter-in-place order for the university. Authorities identified the gunman as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, though his motive remains under investigation. DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose was fatally shot in the exchange of gunfire. No CDC employees or other civilians were harmed during the attack, which left bullet marks on several campus buildings.</p>

          <p>An early morning shooting in New York City's Times Square left three people injured, including two teenagers and a 65-year-old man. The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a restaurant on 44th Street and Seventh Avenue, which then escalated and spilled outside, where shots were fired. Police have taken a 17-year-old suspect into custody and recovered a firearm at the scene. The victims, a 19-year-old male, an 18-year-old female, and the older man, were all hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries and are in stable condition. The investigation is ongoing to determine the relationship between the suspect and victims.</p>

Growing up in a challenging environment, Amaya found salvation and identity in art, which propelled her into a successful modeling career with major agencies.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested more than 150 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a recently proscribed organization. The government banned the group under the Terrorism Act, making any form of support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Protesters held signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to a significant police operation to detain them. The protest was organized by Defend Our Juries, which argues the ban infringes on free speech and is intended to challenge UK complicity in the conflict.</p>

Appointed to head the FBI in 1978 by President Carter, he was credited with restoring the agency's reputation after a period of scandal. Later, President Reagan chose him to lead the CIA in 1987 to bring stability following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his integrity and non-partisan approach, Webster was a respected public servant who emphasized the importance of the rule of law throughout his long career in law and government.</p>

These fraudulent communications often appear official, using phrases like "pre-qualified" for a 401(k) rollover and citing real personal details to build trust. The goal is to trick individuals into transferring funds or revealing sensitive financial information. The article warns consumers to be wary of unsolicited offers, high-pressure tactics, and promises of guaranteed returns. It advises verifying any financial offers directly with trusted institutions and taking steps to remove personal information from data broker websites to reduce exposure.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals in the 1990s, has updated his guidance for today's retirees. In his new book, he argues that with a properly diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, a safe withdrawal rate is now closer to 4.7%. Bengen notes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirees and that his original rule was based on a worst-case scenario. He now suggests that many retirees are too conservative and could safely withdraw more, potentially around 5.25% to 5.5%, to better enjoy their accumulated wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition is shedding light on the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who was one of the most celebrated still-life artists of her time, even more famous than Vermeer or Rembrandt. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch developed a unique perspective on life and decay, which she channeled into perfecting the art of flower painting. The article explores how her work transcended mere decoration, combining scientific accuracy, aesthetic beauty, and moral messaging. Her paintings often depicted exotic blooms from around the globe, reflecting the Dutch Republic's colonial reach, while also subtly capturing the predatory aspects of the natural world.</p>

The plan has drawn widespread condemnation from humanitarian agencies and world leaders, who fear it will cause immense suffering.

The procedure was troubled from the start, with staff struggling for roughly 10 minutes to insert an IV.

Following successful neurosurgery to remove the malformation, Logan has made a full recovery and is preparing to return to the football field, with his family advocating for earlier, more thorough testing.</p>

          <h2>Startup Proposes Using Nuclear Fusion Byproduct to Manufacture Gold</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A San Francisco-based startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold as a byproduct of nuclear fusion. The theory suggests that neutrons produced during the fusion process could be used to transmute more common elements, like mercury, into gold. This would not be the primary goal, but rather a way to generate revenue to offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion energy, a clean power source. While scientifically plausible and intriguing to physicists, the idea remains entirely speculative, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist. The concept echoes centuries of alchemical pursuits, but with a foundation in modern physics.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California implemented a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers are still dying from preventable heat-related illnesses, with advocates blaming a lack of enforcement. A state audit recently criticized the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) for failing to take proper action and being understaffed. Many farmworkers, a large number of whom are undocumented, are hesitant to report unsafe conditions for fear of retaliation. As climate change brings more frequent and intense heat waves, laborers face increasing risks during peak harvest season with what critics call a failing enforcement system.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a pivotal CIA analyst who helped unmask one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, has died at the age of 79. In the early 1990s, Grimes was part of a small team tasked with discovering why the agency's Soviet informants were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous investigation into financial records and activity logs was instrumental in identifying fellow CIA officer Aldrich Ames as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 after receiving millions from the Soviet Union for his espionage. Grimes's determined work was crucial in stopping a spy who caused immense damage to U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is urging satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by spinning off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. In a letter to the company, Carronade argues that Viasat is "materially misunderstood" and undervalued by the market, which wrongly views it as a legacy satellite firm threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm contends that the fast-growing and highly profitable DAT business is a "hidden gem" that would be valued much higher as a standalone entity, potentially leading to a significant increase in Viasat's overall share price.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's second-term economic policies—including high tariffs, cuts to government subsidies, and attacks on scientific research—are effectively a "degrowth" strategy that will make Americans poorer. The author contends that these actions are designed to raise prices, reduce consumption, and lower productivity, leading to a smaller overall economy. While Trump promises prosperity, his trade war, reduction in support for programs like Medicaid and renewable energy, and anti-immigration stance are creating shortages and weakening key sectors. The author concludes this approach constitutes a form of "financial nihilism" that will harm the country's long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision comes as the project's lead and numerous other staff members have left the company, some joining a competing data center firm. CEO Elon Musk, who once hyped Dojo, acknowledged it was a "long shot" and stated it doesn't make sense to scale two different AI chip designs. Instead, Tesla will reportedly focus on its next-generation inference chips and rely more on external partners like Nvidia for its large-scale AI training needs.</p>

The Perseids, which originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, are known for producing bright fireballs and are one of the most popular annual showers. For those still hoping to catch a glimpse, astronomers recommend finding a dark location away from city lights and looking towards the north in the predawn hours.</p>
