          <p>This article recounts how Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix, potentially saved the life of Chris Smith after he was shot in the head during a violent incident on Thanksgiving Day 2021. Smith was found by EMT Dennis Hobson in his Farmersville, Illinois home alongside his deceased date, Leslie Reeves. Hobson noted that Tiki was huddled with Smith, providing warmth in the cold house, which likely helped him survive the 12 hours before he was rescued. Robert Tarr, Reeves' ex-boyfriend, was convicted of murder and attempted murder in connection with the shooting. Smith, despite suffering from paralysis, is recovering and has started a motivational speaking business.</p>

The grandmother contacted police after finding her grandson playing with a live bullet and a hammer, revealing that Pardo had taken him to a surplus store to buy tactical gear.

          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a critical issue for voters in high-tax states.

The House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure to raise the cap to $30,000, but the issue remains unresolved.

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is blocking middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with a $75,000 annual income, down from about half before the pandemic. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach, with the affordability gap worsening in cities with restrictive zoning rules. The lack of affordable housing is partly responsible for driving up prices, as buyers bid up home prices to secure a property.</p>

The plot, involving an all-knowing AI villain, weighs down the narrative, making it less engaging than previous installments.

          <h2>Analysts Warn of Continued US-China Trade Clashes Despite Tariff Pause</h2>

          <p>Diplomatic observers suggest that the recent agreement between the US and China to pause tariff increases represents a success for Beijing's strategy against "economic bullying," but caution that long-term confrontations are still likely. The 90-day truce is not expected to avoid persisting structural divides in bilateral ties, and analysts call for early preparation to address these issues. While President Trump frequently discussed tariffs during his election campaign, the reciprocal tariffs imposed after April 2 significantly hampered trade between the two nations.</p>

While he did not directly mention President Donald Trump's tariffs, Powell acknowledged the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

          <p>LA28, the committee planning the 2028 Summer Games, is partnering with Archer Aviation to assemble a fleet of electric air taxis designed to reduce car traffic during the Olympics. Archer’s air taxis will offer 10- to 20-minute flights between vertiports throughout the city, catering to spectators and VIPs. The partnership is part of a large-scale effort to create a “car-free” Olympics, allowing the city to better manage the Games’ expected 15 million attendees and promote a more sustainable transportation future.</p>
