          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 05:37:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 5% decline to $4,588.85 on Monday, retracting from its record high of $4,954.81 achieved over the weekend. This market correction followed an initial rally across crypto assets last Friday, prompted by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's indications of potential rate cuts, which had shifted investors into a risk-on mode. The recent strength of Ether has been supported by favorable regulatory conditions, a surge in stablecoin interest, and substantial corporate buying, helping it maintain the $4,000 level after several past attempts. However, the current downturn has triggered significant liquidations of long positions in both Ether and Bitcoin, highlighting the market's inherent volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to maintain a north-northeasterly course over the central Atlantic Ocean through Monday and Tuesday, with the National Hurricane Center confirming it poses no threat to land. Located approximately 360 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, the storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is moving at 12 mph. Although slight strengthening is possible today, weakening is forecast to begin tonight, with Fernand anticipated to become post-tropical by Wednesday. This system is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted would be an above-normal season, projecting between 13 and 18 named storms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has implemented an increase in minimum e-commerce delivery fees, notably by 0.4 yuan in Guangdong province, as part of a broader strategy to counteract "disorderly low-price competition" and prevent detrimental price spirals. This policy adjustment is primarily directed at e-commerce clients, with minimal impact expected on individual consumers. The initiative stems from a directive issued by President Xi Jinping's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, which emphasized the need to regulate market practices, enhance product quality, and manage the retirement of obsolete industrial capacity. Experts predict this "anti-involution drive" will likely extend to additional regions, fostering a more stable and sustainable e-commerce sector.</p>

          <p>Shares in wind farm developer Orsted plummeted 17% to a record low after the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order for its Revolution Wind Project off Rhode Island. The project, already 80% complete with 45 out of 65 turbines installed, faces an uncertain future, prompting Orsted to consider options for resolution. This halt significantly jeopardizes the company's plans to raise 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) through a rights issue, despite the Danish state's continued support as a majority stakeholder. Analysts warn that a worst-case scenario could lead to a multi-billion write-down and increased capital requirements, creating considerable financial instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on her controversial 2015 decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees, stating her policy was guided by humanitarian principles and human dignity. In an interview, Merkel acknowledged the immense challenges of integrating 800,000 refugees, many fleeing the Syrian civil war, and expressed surprise at the criticism her "Wir schaffen das" (We can do this) statement received. Despite contributing to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), she maintained that using force to prevent entry was never an option and stood by her decision as morally necessary. She recognized that integration remains a significant ongoing challenge for Germany.</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner, deeming his letter to President Emmanuel Macron, which criticized France's efforts against antisemitism, as "unacceptable." The U.S. State Department, conversely, supported Kushner's actions, stating he was effectively advancing national interests. In his letter, Kushner provocatively suggested that France's public statements regarding Israel and gestures towards recognizing a Palestinian state were emboldening extremists and jeopardizing Jewish communities. This diplomatic incident underscores ongoing strains in French-U.S. relations, which have previously included disputes over trade, the future of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, and differing approaches to the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. students are returning to school amidst President Trump's deployment of over 2,000 National Guard troops, though Mayor Muriel Bowser asserts federal agencies are not needed for school safety. Bowser believes the city's existing safe passage and connect programs, alongside local law enforcement, are sufficient, arguing the crime rate had already decreased significantly before the surge. While Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith noted some community members found federal presence helpful, concerns remain about the impact of military-style vehicles and troops near Metro stations, a common route for students.

          <p>A resurgence of left-handed tennis players, notably Ben Shelton and Jack Draper, could disrupt the US Open, drawing parallels to a period in the late 1970s and early 1980s when southpaws dominated. Despite a historical scarcity of left-handed Grand Slam champions since John McEnroe in 1984, lefties possess distinct advantages, such as unique ball trajectories and spins that often confound right-handed opponents. Shelton, ranked world No. 6, and Draper, who both recently secured their first Masters titles, are demonstrating improved consistency and powerful serves, positioning them as legitimate threats to top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Their success could herald a new era of diverse matchups and added drama in the sport.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has voiced concerns about the U.S. labor market, citing a significant slowdown in job growth and a surge in long-term job seekers as red flags. Government data revealed a sharp decrease in hiring for July, with May and June figures also revised downwards, alarming policymakers and leading to President Trump questioning the data's accuracy. Labor experts warn of further pain for job seekers, attributing the downturn to companies delaying hiring amidst new U.S. tariffs and the rise of artificial intelligence.

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Duke of York and Jeffrey Epstein, is scheduled for an October release. Giuffre, who tragically took her own life in April, had completed the book and explicitly wished for its publication. The memoir will be the first time Giuffre speaks publicly about Prince Andrew since their 2022 out-of-court settlement, which included his expression of regret for association with Epstein but no admission of liability. Publisher Alfred A Knopf states the 400-page book will share "intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking new details" about her experiences, aiming to shed light on systemic failures in trafficking.</p>

          <p>Nio, the Chinese electric carmaker, saw its Hong Kong-listed shares surge over 14%, marking a seventh consecutive session of gains, following the unveiling of its new ES8 SUV. This latest model, priced at an accessible 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, represents one of Nio's most affordable offerings, contrasting with its premium SUVs. The subscription model aims to lower upfront costs and allow battery swaps, with deliveries commencing in late September. This strategic move comes as Nio faces intense competition in China's EV sector, prompting the company to launch cheaper brands like Onvo and Firefly to broaden its customer base.

          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, and core inflation also dipped to 0.5%. This moderation was driven by declines in retail goods, electricity, and gas prices, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipating "moderate" inflation in the near term due to easing global crude oil and food commodity prices. Slower nominal wage growth and productivity increases are also expected to contribute to a moderation in unit labor costs. This economic data strengthens the case for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in October, providing a buffer against weaker growth and rising trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs.

However, former energy minister Charles Hendry and experts express skepticism, citing the UK's complex geology, higher costs, and public opposition that hampered previous attempts.
