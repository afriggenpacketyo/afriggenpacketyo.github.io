          <p>An office cleaner at 345 Park Avenue in Manhattan has shared her harrowing experience of coming face-to-face with the gunman responsible for a deadly shooting. Sebije Nelovic, 65, described how the attacker pointed his rifle at her before she managed to run and hide in a closet for several hours. The gunman, who killed four people before taking his own life, was reportedly targeting the NFL headquarters but went to the wrong floor. In a note, the suspect claimed to suffer from CTE and requested his brain be studied, though a diagnosis cannot be confirmed post-mortem.</p>

          <p>In the first federal jury trial of its kind, plaintiffs are seeking $345 million from Tesla over a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system that resulted in a fatality. The incident occurred when a driver, believing the system would brake automatically, accelerated through an intersection, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' lawyers argue that Tesla knowingly sold a defective system and overstated its capabilities, encouraging driver over-reliance. Tesla's defense counters that the driver was at fault and that a verdict against the company would discourage the development of life-saving technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order modifying "reciprocal" tariffs on numerous countries, with new rates ranging from 10% to 41%. A key provision in the order imposes an additional 40% duty on any goods determined to have been transshipped to evade existing tariffs. Countries not specifically listed will face a default 10% tariff, while those nearing trade agreements with the U.S. will be subject to the modified rates until pacts are finalized. The order also formalizes a tariff increase on Canadian goods to 35%, excluding items covered by the USMCA. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Amazon's stock falling after its second-quarter earnings report, some analysts are maintaining a buy rating, viewing the dip as a buying opportunity. The company exceeded revenue and earnings expectations, but a slight beat from its cloud unit, AWS, and a mixed third-quarter operating income forecast disappointed investors. The core investment thesis remains intact, focusing on the long-term growth of high-margin businesses like AWS and advertising, both of which performed well. Analysts argue that management's guidance is often conservative and that continued efforts to lower e-commerce costs will expand margins, ultimately driving the stock higher.

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has long desired. The $200 million addition to the East Wing will be funded by private donations, including from the president himself, with construction slated to begin in September. The new venue will seat approximately 650 guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity, eliminating the need for large tents for state dinners and other major events. The administration stated the project would be completed well before the end of the president's term in 2029.</p>

          <p>Health experts are expressing concern about the increasing use of caffeine pouches among teenagers in the United States, a trend they fear could spread to other countries. These small, teabag-like pouches are placed in the mouth for a rapid caffeine dose, with some containing as much as two cups of coffee. Promoted by social media influencers for gym performance and studying, their discreet nature makes them easy to hide from parents and teachers. Experts warn that young people have lower caffeine tolerance, and overuse could lead to dangerous side effects like rapid heart rate and anxiety.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major cities that have long powered economic growth in China's Guangdong province, are reporting underperforming GDP figures, raising concerns about their momentum. Analysts attribute the slowdown to a combination of weakening global demand, which has hurt exports, and insufficient domestic consumption. Shenzhen, in particular, has seen a significant drop in fixed-asset investment and a plunge in real estate development, signaling a decline in investor confidence. While the cities' hi-tech sectors continue to grow, the overall economic picture has prompted calls for stronger government action to revive business activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After threatening sweeping tariffs in April, the Trump administration has now imposed new duties and secured a handful of deals without causing the massive financial market disruption initially feared. While the White House claims victory, the long-term consequences of this reshaped global trade landscape are still uncertain. The new policies have increased tariff revenue for the U.S. but also mean higher costs for exporters selling into the American market, which could eventually be passed on to consumers. The approach has served as a wake-up call for many nations, potentially prompting them to form new alliances that bypass the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The competitive landscape of China's food delivery market is intensifying as major players Meituan and JD.com invest heavily in building centralized kitchens for takeaways. Meituan plans to launch 1,200 "Raccoon Restaurants," which are food court-style hubs where various chains can operate kitchens solely for delivery, aiming to cut costs and boost efficiency. Meanwhile, e-commerce giant JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own "7Fresh" kitchens over the next three years. These strategic moves signal a new phase in the battle for dominance in the massive on-demand delivery sector.</p>

          <p>Colombia's government reported that deforestation surged by 43% in 2024 compared to the previous year, a sharp reversal of a recent downward trend. The Amazon rainforest region was the most affected, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of forest destroyed. Authorities attribute the increase to factors like land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, cultivation of illicit crops, and wildfires intensified by drought. Despite the spike, the overall level of deforestation remains below the 2021 baseline, but the new data presents a significant setback for the biodiverse nation's conservation efforts.</p>

However, President Trump did not clarify his stance on the matter at a later event. The uncertainty comes after U.S. and Chinese officials held talks in Stockholm, with the president stating he would make a decision after being briefed on the outcome of those negotiations.

This successful debut is a welcome sign for Silicon Valley's venture firms, which have seen scarce returns from IPOs in recent years.

While overall sales grew a healthy 13% and the advertising business was a bright spot, investors focused on the cautious guidance.

          <p>The Trump administration's consideration of reviving the presidential fitness test brings back a program with a long history in American schools. Originally initiated by President Eisenhower in 1956 out of concern for national security and combat preparedness, the test typically assessed cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility through exercises like a one-mile run and push-ups. Despite its goals, the test's effectiveness in improving youth health is questionable, as data shows that child health metrics in the U.S. have significantly worsened over the decades. The original impetus for the test was a study showing American children lagging far behind their European counterparts in fitness.</p>

This use of tariff authority is legally questionable and diplomatically risky, potentially undermining U.S. credibility. The piece suggests that this approach betrays his original promise to voters, prioritizing foreign political allies over the economic interests of American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
