          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, the daughter of actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was among those arrested at Columbia University during anti-war protests against Israel's actions in Gaza. The Columbia freshman received a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing after students occupied part of the Butler Library, renaming it the Basel al-Araj Peopleâ€™s University. University officials called in the police, leading to numerous arrests and temporary suspensions of student journalists covering the event. Columbia University and Barnard College later lifted the suspensions of the student reporters, as the latest wave of demonstrations occurred amid crackdowns on student protests across US universities.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the economic tension caused by escalating tariffs. The meetings are the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory levies from China. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the talks, fearing that a prolonged trade war could lead to slower global growth and higher prices. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that negotiations are taking place has raised hopes for a potential easing of tensions.</p>

          <p>After days of intense fighting, including missile and drone strikes, India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire, though reports of continued violence persist. The conflict, sparked by a terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, has led to heavy damage on both sides. President Trump initially announced the cease-fire, claiming U.S. mediation, a claim disputed by India, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated U.S. engagement with both countries' leaders. Despite the agreement, cross-border firing has been reported, and both sides continue to spread conflicting information, making it difficult to verify the precise nature and location of attacks.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during a joint visit to Kyiv, announced that Russia would face new and massive sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain stated that the European effort had been coordinated closely with the White House, and that President Trump had signaled his support for the proposal. The Kremlin dismissed the threat of new sanctions, stating that Russia was accustomed to such measures.</p>

The Teal Wand allows women to collect a vaginal sample at home, which is then mailed to a lab for HPV screening. This aims to provide a more convenient and less anxiety-inducing experience, potentially increasing cervical cancer screening rates. The FDA approval follows a U.S.-based study indicating that at-home screening is just as effective and preferred by women, with availability starting next month in California.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr has announced his retirement from the NFL after 11 seasons, citing a labral tear and degenerative rotator cuff injury in his right shoulder.
