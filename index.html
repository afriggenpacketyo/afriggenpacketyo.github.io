          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final by defeating Novak Djokovic in a decisive straight-sets victory. The 23-year-old Italian's win prevents the 38-year-old Djokovic from securing a record 25th Grand Slam title, with Djokovic attributing the loss to the effects of age. Sinner will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated rematch of their recent five-set French Open final. This upcoming final continues a trend where at least one of the two young stars has competed in the last six Grand Slam men's singles finals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses addictive design features to exploit its younger users for commercial gain, such as increased ad exposure and purchases on TikTok Shop. The judge ruled that the state's claims focus on the app's allegedly dangerous features, not user-generated content, a legal strategy also being used against other tech companies like Meta. This case adds to the legal pressures on TikTok, which already faces a potential U.S. ban pending a divestiture by its parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:33:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting over 1,300 civil and foreign service positions as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. This move, part of a plan to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by about 15%, has been criticized by Democrats as undermining national security. The administration frames the reorganization, which also involves closing or merging numerous domestic offices, as an effort to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and increase efficiency. The layoffs are based on employees' office assignments as of a specific date, a method that has drawn alarm from the American Foreign Service Association for being "untethered from merit or mission."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have unveiled a new bobblehead featuring the late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, which will be given to the first 40,000 fans at their game on August 8. The design appears to be inspired by a 2009 press day where Bryant, dressed in his full Lakers uniform, posed with a baseball bat. This promotional item continues the Dodgers' tradition of honoring the basketball icon, who, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, died in a 2020 helicopter crash. The team has previously paid tribute to Bryant with special jersey giveaways in 2023 and 2024.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates are encountering increased difficulty in the job market, with emerging data suggesting generative AI is a contributing factor. Job listings for traditional entry-level corporate roles have fallen by 15%, while applications per job have surged by 30%. Experts note that AI is particularly adept at handling the routine tasks often assigned to new hires, leading to a redefinition of entry-level positions and a higher demand for AI-related skills. This trend is causing a notable rise in unemployment among young degree holders, pushing some to consider skilled trades over traditional white-collar career paths.</p>

In response to record-low rainfall and drought conditions, hosepipe bans have been imposed on over seven million people, restricting water use for activities like gardening and washing cars. The extreme heat has also led to warnings for festival-goers and an extreme wildfire risk alert in Scotland. Health officials are urging the public, especially those with pre-existing conditions, to take precautions as the high temperatures are expected to persist through the weekend.</p>

To potentially receive a sentence less than life in prison, Guzman Lopez must provide "substantial assistance" to the U.S. government, with the final sentencing decision resting solely with the judge. His guilty plea marks a significant development, as he is the first of El Chapo's sons to strike such a deal with federal prosecutors.</p>

Frost is accused of personally misappropriating over $19 million for luxury expenses and political contributions, even as the business was collapsing.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, set to begin on August 1, escalating trade tensions between the two nations. In a letter, Trump linked the new tariffs to Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl flows and existing levies on U.S. dairy, while also threatening broader tariffs on other trade partners. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney affirmed his government's commitment to protecting Canadian workers and businesses. This move adds to existing global tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, which have already significantly impacted Canada's export-driven economy, though some goods under the CUSMA trade pact may remain exempt.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally. The upward trend was also supported by a wave of short liquidations, where traders betting against Bitcoin were forced to buy back in, further pushing up the price. This market excitement reflects growing investor confidence, influenced by expectations of more dovetailed U.S. Federal Reserve policies and potential crypto-friendly legislation from Congress.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is set to lose its hard-won Europa League spot to Nottingham Forest due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, and will instead compete in the lower-tier Conference League. The issue stems from John Textor's ownership stake in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. Because Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, they receive precedence, and Palace is penalized for missing a March deadline to alter its ownership structure to comply with UEFA regulations. The decision has sparked acrimony, with Palace expected to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, potentially creating a new rivalry with Forest.</p>

He led the UK's largest police force from 2005 to 2008, a tenure marked by significant events, most notably the 7/7 London bombings. His leadership also came under intense scrutiny following the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by firearms officers, who mistook the Brazilian electrician for a terror suspect. Although cleared of personal wrongdoing, the incident cast a long shadow over his career, and he ultimately stepped down in 2008 after losing the confidence of the newly elected London mayor, Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>Relatives of Israeli hostages with dual German citizenship, who were abducted by Hamas on October 7, have traveled to Berlin to appeal for greater German involvement in securing their release. The families are meeting with German officials to urge more diplomatic pressure, stating that while they have received sympathy, it is now time for decisive action. Of the 24 hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza, five are German-Israeli citizens. The families are pinning their hopes on ongoing ceasefire negotiations, emphasizing the critical need for international pressure to reach a deal and free their loved ones, some of whom are in dire medical condition.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is struggling with a grant backlog exceeding one billion dollars, prompting the agency to ask some laid-off staff to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic hurdles implemented by the Trump administration's "Defend the Spend" initiative, which stalled the approval process for awarding funds. The backlog affects critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and youth homelessness, with some funding already having lapsed. To catch up before the September fiscal deadline, officials fear they may need to drastically shorten application periods, putting immense pressure on organizations that rely on these federal grants.</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights office has reported that nearly 800 people have been killed while trying to access humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip since late May. The majority of these deaths, 615, occurred at or near distribution centers operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), with most injuries resulting from gunshots. The UN figures highlight the chaotic and dangerous conditions surrounding aid distribution, which has been plagued by reports of Israeli forces firing on civilians. This comes as ceasefire negotiations continue in Qatar, with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsening and access to essential supplies remaining perilous for its population.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors concerned about potential Social Security shortfalls, several financial tools can provide supplemental income. One option is a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive monthly payments drawn from their home equity, with repayment deferred until the home is sold. Another strategy is purchasing an annuity, where a lump-sum payment to an insurer guarantees a reliable stream of income for life, providing security regardless of economic fluctuations. While carrying higher interest rates, a personal loan can also serve as an emergency fund to bridge financial gaps left by insufficient Social Security payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to quickly access their home equity this July have several accelerated options for obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with a fully online lender can significantly speed up the process, as their digital platforms often feature automated verification and virtual appraisals. Another fast-track method is to apply for a "low-doc" or "no-doc" HELOC, which minimizes paperwork but may come with higher rates. Homeowners might also find a quicker path by applying with their existing mortgage lender, who already has their financial information on file, potentially streamlining the underwriting and approval timeline.

          <p>Christina Block, the heiress to Germany's Block House steakhouse empire, is on trial in Hamburg, accused of orchestrating the violent kidnapping of her two youngest children from their father in Denmark. Prosecutors allege that on New Year's Eve, hired men ambushed her ex-husband, Stephan Hensel, and forcibly took the children, then aged 10 and 13, back to Germany. Block denies the charges, claiming a security firm acted on its own initiative out of her desperation, as she had been in a lengthy custody battle. If convicted of charges including aggravated child abduction and grievous bodily harm, Block could face up to 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% import tariff on Brazilian goods, linking the economic measure to Brazil's domestic politics. In a social media post, Trump defended former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly plotting a coup, calling the proceedings a "WITCH HUNT" and demanding authorities "LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE." The threat has sparked outrage in Brazil, with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government asserting its sovereignty and the independence of its judiciary. This use of tariffs to interfere in another nation's legal affairs marks a significant escalation in Trump's deployment of trade policy as a political tool.</p>

The dispute centers on council plans to downgrade roles, which the union says will result in significant pay cuts for workers.
