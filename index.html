          <p>Authorities have shared new details about a double homicide at Devil's Den State Park in Arkansas. They report that Cristen Amanda Brink was killed after guiding her children to safety and returning to help her husband, Clinton David Brink, who was attacked first. A 28-year-old former teacher, Andrew James McGann, has been charged with two counts of capital murder following a five-day search. Police state that McGann has admitted to the killings, and his DNA was found at the scene, while the couple's two young daughters were found unharmed.</p>

          <p>The World Darts Federation has ruled that transgender women, who are biological males, are now ineligible for female competitions. In response, transgender darts player Noa-Lynn van Leuven publicly expressed her heartbreak, calling the decision a significant loss for the trans community in sports. Van Leuven argued that the policy, while framed around the concept of fairness, ultimately results in the exclusion of athletes. The Professional Darts Championship (PDC), a separate circuit, has indicated it does not plan to change its own rules regarding transgender competitors.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac CEO Will Lansing has defended his company's pricing for FICO credit scores against recent criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Lansing argued that the $4.95 cost for a mortgage score is a minor part of overall closing costs and does not represent a barrier to homeownership. This statement comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use the rival VantageScore model and its head characterized FICO as a monopoly. Lansing countered by highlighting FICO's dominant market share and asserting its models are more predictive and safer for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Colombian government has reported a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, marking a sharp reversal of a positive trend. The Amazon rainforest was the most affected area, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of forest destroyed. Authorities attribute this surge to factors like land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, illicit crop cultivation, and wildfires. Despite the spike, officials note that the overall deforestation level remains below the 2021 baseline, maintaining a longer-term downward trend for the highly biodiverse nation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued conflicting signals regarding the future of its trade agreement with China. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt expressed doubt that an extension of the current pause on tariff hikes was being considered, though she deferred to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading negotiations. Later, President Trump himself did not clarify his stance on extending the tariff suspension. This uncertainty follows recent talks in Stockholm between U.S. and Chinese officials, with the administration claiming the current program is already reducing the U.S. trade deficit.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate cuts, savers holding maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) are facing a key strategic decision. The article suggests that the current high-rate environment presents a valuable opportunity to renew CDs, as rates are likely to remain elevated for the near future. It advises savers to actively shop around for the best available rates, potentially locking in a high-yield, long-term CD before any future rate cuts occur. Savers are warned against allowing their CDs to automatically roll over, as they could be placed into new accounts with much lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends this approach undermines U.S. credibility, harms American consumers, and betrays his original promise to voters by prioritizing the interests of foreign figures over national economic well-being.

However, it concludes that since the difference in earnings is often negligible, the choice between the two should also depend on other features, such as the check-writing capabilities that are typically offered by money market accounts.

          <p>In an emotional public hearing, Texas lawmakers heard harrowing testimony from survivors and local officials regarding the deadly July 4 floods in central Texas. Survivors and some legislators criticized the local response, highlighting that key Kerr County emergency officials were either ill, asleep, or out of town as the floodwaters rapidly rose. Local officials defended their actions by citing communication challenges and the unprecedented nature of the flood, which killed over 130 people. Grieving family members and residents called for better warning systems and expressed deep frustration with the bureaucratic response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The gunman who killed four people in a Manhattan office shooting had a valid concealed carry permit from Nevada, despite a documented history of mental health incidents. The shooter, Shane Tamura, was issued the permit in 2022, the same year as one of two documented mental health episodes he experienced. He legally purchased a handgun with the permit and also acquired the AR-15 style rifle used in the attack from a coworker. The incident highlights the complexities of state gun laws, as possessing such weapons is illegal in New York, prompting renewed calls for national gun control measures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House's East Wing. The project, with an estimated cost of around $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with construction scheduled to begin in September. The new State Ballroom will have a capacity for 650 seated guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity, and is intended to eliminate the need for temporary tents for large state functions. The announcement fulfills a long-stated desire of the president to add a grand ballroom to the executive mansion.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has warned that Israel is at risk of international isolation due to its military actions and the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which he described as being "beyond imagination."

The article also notes that a U.S. special envoy is set to visit Gaza, Israel has conducted new strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the U.S. has sanctioned some Palestinian Authority officials.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the Los Angeles Times, a city council member has introduced a motion to compel Los Angeles to comply with a 2019 state law requiring a formal analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The law, AB 747, mandates that local governments assess the capacity and viability of these routes in their public safety plans, a step L.A. has failed to complete. The city's planning department had previously cited terrorism concerns for not publicizing the routes. The new motion demands a report on evacuation routes in high-risk areas within 30 days.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide earlier this year, has expressed shock at President Trump's recent comments. Trump claimed he was aware that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre and other employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a public statement, Giuffre's family questioned whether this meant Trump was aware of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal activities at the time. Trump later clarified that he did not know why Epstein was hiring his staff but had expelled him from the club for the behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that changes to federal student loan programs under a new Trump administration law will harm students pursuing professional degrees in California. The law caps federal loans for professional school students at $50,000 per year, creating a significant funding gap for expensive programs like medicine and law at UC schools. The author fears this will prevent many working-class students from entering these critical fields, exacerbating existing shortages of doctors, nurses, and public interest lawyers, and urges California to create its own state-level loan program to fill the gap.
