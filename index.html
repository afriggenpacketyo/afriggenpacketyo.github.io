          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that federal courts lack the authority to issue nationwide injunctions, which block government policies across the entire country. The case, *Trump v. Casa*, concerned an executive order on birthright citizenship, but the ruling focused solely on the remedy, not the order's constitutionality. While this ends a practice used to thwart both Republican and Democratic administrations, the majority opinion left open other avenues for broad relief, such as class-action lawsuits and complete relief for plaintiffs.</p>

The author contends that years of activism shifted public discourse, making Mamdani's vocal pro-Palestinian stance an asset rather than a liability within the Democratic party. The campaign's success is attributed to a coalition of activists and voters who were already mobilized on progressive issues and saw him as an alternative to an establishment that overlooks their concerns.</p>

          <h2>Defense Department to Cease Providing Key Satellite Weather Data, Affecting Hurricane and Ice Monitoring</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is ending its 40-year practice of providing crucial satellite weather data to scientists and forecasters, a move that could impact hurricane forecasting and sea ice monitoring. The data, processed by the Navy, has been vital for real-time analysis of storm structure and intensity. While NOAA states its own sources are sufficient, experts worry the loss of this data stream will create gaps in observation at a time when rapidly intensifying hurricanes are becoming more common.</p>

          <h2>Delayed CDC Grant Funding Causes Layoffs and Halts Public Health Programs Nationwide</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health departments across the U.S. are facing a crisis as grant funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is months late without explanation, forcing program halts and layoffs. CDC insiders reveal the agency has not received its full fiscal year budget and is operating on 30-day increments, preventing it from awarding grants for critical work like HIV prevention and cancer screening. This delay, which some staff believe is intentional, threatens to grind the nation's public health apparatus to a halt.</p>
