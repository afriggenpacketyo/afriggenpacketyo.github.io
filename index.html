          <p>A passenger arriving in Mumbai, India from Thailand was apprehended by customs officials for smuggling dozens of venomous vipers. The snakes, including 44 Indonesian pit vipers and three Spider-tailed horned vipers, were concealed in the passenger's checked-in baggage. In addition to the snakes, five Asian leaf turtles were also discovered. This seizure is relatively unusual, as customs officers more commonly find smuggled gold, cash, or drugs. </p>

The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, potentially making lunar bases self-sufficient and serving as refueling stations for Mars-bound astronauts.</p>

          <p>A restaurant consultant revealed some unwritten rules of etiquette for dining out, including avoiding "one-timing" a server by placing multiple requests at once and using a polite wave to get their attention. It's also important to understand that mistakes can happen in the kitchen, and customers should approach issues calmly rather than blaming the server immediately. The appropriate time to remain at a table after finishing a meal is about two to two-and-a-half hours for fine dining and one to one-and-45 minutes for casual dining. It is also courteous to place your first order shortly after being seated.</p>

Higher mortgage rates have led people to borrow for longer terms to keep monthly repayments manageable. About two in five new mortgages have terms extending into retirement. Although mortgage rates have recently fallen, these terms are not showing signs of decreasing, with rising house prices offsetting any lowering of payments. </p>

          <p>Greta Thunberg, along with other activists including actor Liam Cunningham, has set sail for Gaza aiming to "break the Israeli blockade." They departed from Sicily on the ship Madleen to draw attention to the situation of civilians in Gaza. Thunberg stated that the world cannot be silent bystanders to the systematic starvation of 2 million people, asserting a moral obligation to fight for a free Palestine. The activists anticipate a seven-day journey, though it's unlikely they will reach Gaza due to Israeli authorities' control of the enclave’s waters.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist former boxer, has narrowly won Poland’s presidential election, delivering a major blow to the country’s pro-EU government. The 42-year-old right-wing historian, an admirer of Donald Trump, took 50.89 per cent of votes in Sunday’s run-off, the national election commission said. Nawrocki’s win is a blow to the government of Donald Tusk, the prime minister and a former European Council president who came to power in 2023, as well as those in Brussels who had hoped that Mr Trzaskowski would fully align Poland with the EU.</p>

A sweeping bill moving through the Legislature will require districts to adopt instructional materials based on the “science of reading,” from transitional kindergarten through third grade. The bill is the capstone to decades of debate and controversy in California on how best to teach reading. The science of reading consists of five pillars: phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to curtail or destroy institutions like PBS, NPR, Harvard, the Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, and Voice of America. He has ordered that the Corp. for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies stop public financing for PBS and NPR. In addition to cutting funds for PBS and NPR, Trump has, via executive order, threatened to defund elite universities, including Harvard, that refuse to take government dictation over curriculum and hiring policies.</p>
