          <p>A popular Taiwanese YouTuber, known as Gym Boss, is encouraging Taiwanese citizens to visit Shanghai and experience life there firsthand. Chen Chih-han, once a critic of Beijing, now describes Shanghai as a "super first-rate city" after a self-funded tour. His aim is to challenge the prevailing political narratives in Taiwan by offering an unfiltered view of mainland Chinese society. Chen's perspective shifted after observing the mainland through social media, revealing a gap between online sentiment and official messaging in Taiwan, leading him to encourage others to see for themselves.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached a framework agreement on trade after high-level talks in London, with the deal now subject to approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and the recent call between the two presidents, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. While the framework signals a commitment to de-escalate tensions and continue dialogue, the extent of concrete agreements or substantive breakthroughs remains uncertain. The fact that both sides need to brief their leaders suggests that some disagreements or unresolved details still require internal discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown Los Angeles from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. to address ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew, encompassing a one-square-mile area, aims to prevent vandalism and looting, with law enforcement prepared to arrest curfew violators. The protests, triggered by immigration raids in the Westlake District, downtown, and South LA, have led to nearly 469 arrests and the looting of 23 businesses. President Trump deployed troops from the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to protect federal offices, a move opposed by Governor Newsom, who argues it is an overreach of federal authority.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read trial, concerning the death of Boston cop John O'Keefe, is nearing its end as the defense presents its final witnesses. Prosecutors allege that Read fatally struck O'Keefe with her car after a night of drinking, but the defense argues that his injuries are inconsistent with a car collision. Dr. Andrew Rentschler, a biomechanist, testified that a collision at 15 mph would not have caused the skull fracture O'Keefe sustained. Read has announced that she will not testify in her own defense, and Renstchler is the last witness her team plans to call.</p>

          <p>Germany is expanding its infrastructure to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from various sources, including the United States, as part of its efforts to reduce dependence on Russian gas. This move aligns with broader European strategies to diversify energy supplies and enhance energy security. The increased import capacity will enable Germany to access alternative gas sources and mitigate potential disruptions in Russian gas deliveries.

          <p>Americans are divided on President Trump's decision to send National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid protests against immigration enforcement. Some, like Republican Demesio Guerrero, support the deployment to quell what they view as shameful riots, while others, like Democrat Lori Gregory, express distress and see it as an attack on immigrants and an overreach of presidential power. Independent Eric Kaiser worries about the precedent of using the military against American citizens, while Republican Jim Sullivan is concerned about the future implications of deploying the military in response to protests. The responses reflect a deep polarization over immigration and the role of the federal government.</p>

          <p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the former president of Mongolia, is urging Japanese lawmakers to abolish the death penalty, despite public support for executions in Japan. Elbegdorj, who successfully terminated capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017, suggests that the Japanese government should disclose more information about the death penalty to foster an open debate. He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy and human rights, emphasizing the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. Elbegdorj also notes that violent crimes decreased in Mongolia after the abolition of the death penalty.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will reinstate the original Confederate names of several Army bases, reversing a renaming process initiated by Congress and completed under President Biden. However, the bases will now be named after other service members with similar names, rather than Confederates. The move affects bases such as Fort Gordon, Fort A.P. Hill, and Fort Hood, with each base being renamed to honor different military figures. This decision unwinds a process overseen by the Naming Commission and has sparked debate over the legacy of Confederate symbols in the U.S. military.</p>
