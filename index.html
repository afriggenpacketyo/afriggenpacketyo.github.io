          <p>A cross-party committee of UK Members of Parliament has criticized the Home Office for its failure to track whether foreign workers leave the country after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee reported that since the visa route was introduced in 2020, there has been no analysis of exit check data, leaving the government unaware of potential illegal overstays. The report also highlighted evidence of worker exploitation, including debt bondage and excessive hours, accusing the department of being slow to address these issues. This scrutiny comes as the government aims to curb net migration and modernize its border security systems.</p>

          <p>Representatives for pop star Katy Perry and actor Orlando Bloom have confirmed the couple's separation after a six-year engagement. In a joint statement, they announced a shift in their relationship to focus on co-parenting their four-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove. The couple, who have been romantically linked since 2016, emphasized their commitment to raising their daughter with love and mutual respect. This announcement follows a challenging period for Perry, whose recent music has not met previous commercial success and who faced backlash for a space trip.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from its securities market and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The regulator accused the firm of large-scale market manipulation involving India's Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices. SEBI's order details a strategy where Jane Street allegedly influenced stock prices to profit from large, opposing positions in index options, continuing the practice even after a warning from the National Stock Exchange. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated its commitment to regulatory compliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after a significant election win, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party is contending with numerous challenges, including a decline in public approval and economic stagnation. Key promises to boost growth have not been realized, with business optimism remaining low and household finances strained by high inflation and borrowing costs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has faced criticism for policy U-turns, particularly on welfare, creating fiscal constraints ahead of the next budget. While the government has secured some international trade deals, the rise of the rival Reform UK party highlights growing public disaffection.</p>

          <p>In an interview reflecting on his first year as Prime Minister, Keir Starmer addressed recent policy U-turns, particularly on welfare reform, framing them as pragmatic adjustments rather than weaknesses. He acknowledged that the process for his welfare plans was not handled correctly and took responsibility for the resulting political difficulties, which included a £5 billion loss in planned savings. Starmer emphasized his focus on practical outcomes over rigid ideology, citing achievements like reduced NHS waiting lists and new trade deals. The article notes the difficult political position these reversals have created for his government.</p>

Residents, including students and long-term homeowners, express frustration over the mounting waste and the lack of recycling options.

          <p>Chinese officials have renewed their commitment to tackling the issue of oversupply and 'disorderly low-price competition' within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a recent meeting, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology urged manufacturers to focus on product quality and facilitate the phasing out of outdated production capacity to ensure sustainable development. This directive follows a high-level economic meeting where President Xi Jinping also called for an end to such competitive practices. The statement comes as China's solar industry continues its dominant expansion into global markets.</p>

          <p>Imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi is warning that the Iranian government is using the recent conflict with Israel as a pretext to intensify its repression of citizens. In a message from Tehran, she stated that a surge in arrests and executions shows the regime is attempting to spread fear and deflect from its own policy failures. Mohammadi condemned Israel's strike on Evin Prison but cautioned that the subsequent crackdown, including harsh conditions for transferred prisoners, poses an even greater threat to human rights. She urged the international community to refocus its attention on the escalating internal oppression in Iran.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a key early primary state, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. The tour will take him through eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. The South Carolina Democratic Party framed the visit as an effort to show that these communities are not forgotten by Democrats. However, a political advisor for Newsom denied any presidential ambitions, stating the trip's focus is on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has achieved a significant milestone in chimera research by cultivating a heart structure containing human cells within a pig embryo. The team, from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, reported that the humanized heart structure continued to beat on its own for 21 days. To achieve this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells with genes to prevent rejection and improve their integration into the pig embryos. This development follows the same team's previous success in growing humanized kidneys in pigs, advancing the potential for organ generation.</p>

          <p>A large coalition of more than 175 Democratic members of Congress is legally supporting an NAACP lawsuit against the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the Department of Education. The lawmakers filed an amicus brief arguing that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or dismantle a federal agency, a power that belongs to Congress. The move comes in response to measures that have significantly downsized the department's workforce and paused billions in congressionally approved funding. Democrats contend these actions illegally cut off access to education for students nationwide.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, Los Angeles County public health officials have issued water contact warnings for eight popular beaches due to elevated bacteria levels. The advisory cautions residents to avoid swimming, surfing, or any activity involving getting in the water at specific locations, including areas of Santa Monica Beach, Mothers Beach in Marina Del Rey, and Avalon Beach on Catalina Island. The increased bacteria is attributed to street runoff, and exposure can lead to illness or skin infections. Officials conduct weekly tests but could not estimate when the warnings would be lifted.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign visitors while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee hike, which the administration estimates could generate over $90 million annually to fund park improvements. The directive also calls for giving U.S. residents 'preferential treatment' in park access systems like lotteries or permitting. This 'America First' approach to the national parks is part of a broader set of changes, including staffing cuts and a new conservation commission.</p>

          <p>Veteran groups, legal scholars, and military family advocates are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of troops in U.S. cities like Los Angeles erodes democratic norms and harms service members. Speakers at a virtual news conference argued that using the military for civilian law enforcement pushes the boundaries of the Posse Comitatus Act and places troops in situations for which they are not trained. They highlighted the strain on military families and the inappropriate use of combat-trained Marines against American citizens. Critics described the policy as 'making America militarized again,' expressing concern over the precedent it sets.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that the sharpest increase in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention population consists of immigrants with no criminal convictions. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently in ICE detention have no criminal record, and this group has grown significantly in recent months. This trend appears to contradict administration claims of focusing on the 'worst of the worst' criminals. The article highlights the case of a pastor with no criminal record who lived in the U.S. for 30 years before being detained and deported.</p>

          <p>Significant staffing cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) are creating safety risks for summer visitors, as exemplified by the lack of lifeguards at Maryland's popular Assateague Island National Seashore. Advocacy groups report that the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration began, with a federal hiring freeze exacerbating the problem. This has resulted in fewer seasonal employees, including lifeguards, leaving many popular areas unguarded. Local officials and park advocates express fear that the personnel shortages could lead to preventable accidents and jeopardize visitor safety.</p>
