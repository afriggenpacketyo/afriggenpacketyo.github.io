          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was fatally shot following an incident where a suspect opened fire near the CDC headquarters and Emory University campus. The suspect was later found deceased from a possibly self-inflicted gunshot wound, and no civilians were injured in the exchange. The officer, who leaves behind a pregnant wife and two children, was mourned by officials as a significant loss for the county. The event prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order and is now under investigation by the FBI and GBI.</p>

The building, originally a mosque from the 8th century, was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century and remains a major tourist attraction.</p>

The story follows four artists in Los Angeles who use a fictional app, inspired by tools like ChatGPT, that promises to help their careers but ultimately seeks to control them. The play marks the company's 10th anniversary and reflects a shift toward more topical themes, blending commercial appeal with elements of absurdist theater.

          <p>Over 100,000 acres of almond orchards in Central California are battling a severe rat infestation, causing significant economic damage. The rodents are damaging trees, consuming nuts, and destroying irrigation systems, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. This issue poses a threat to California's almond industry, which accounts for 80% of global production. Growers are employing various pest control methods, but the scale of the infestation presents a major challenge for the region's agriculture.</p>

The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed the retail giant sold products for higher prices than advertised and misstated the weight of items like produce and baked goods. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing in its California stores. The case underscores regulatory efforts to enforce consumer protection laws against pricing discrepancies.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. The meeting comes as a Trump-imposed deadline for a deal approaches, with the administration threatening sanctions if no progress is made. White House officials indicate the summit's planning is fluid, with the possibility of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's involvement. This marks the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and a U.S. leader since 2021, representing a significant diplomatic effort.</p>

          <p>A Fremont man has been charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, some dating to the 13th century, from the UCLA library in a sophisticated scheme.

Federal investigators believe the thefts may have occurred over five years, with the stolen items valued at over $216,000.

This move is part of a broader strategy by former President Trump to secure a Republican House majority in the 2026 midterms.

While advertisers claim the models are healthy, the ASA has ruled that styling, lighting, and poses can create an irresponsibly thin appearance.

          <p>To combat rising loneliness, the city of Seoul has launched "warm-hearted convenience stores," safe spaces offering free food and social connection. These centers provide a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere for isolated individuals, particularly the elderly and unemployed youth, to interact with social workers and peers. The initiative was prompted by an increase in "lonely deaths" and a growing number of single-person households. The program aims to destigmatize seeking help by creating an accessible and non-clinical environment for those feeling disconnected from society.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore allowing alternative investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies, in 401(k) retirement plans. The move aims to "democratize" retirement savings by giving workers access to asset classes that have the potential for high returns, but also carry higher risks and less transparency. While proponents see it as a way to boost long-term growth, experts caution that adoption may be slow due to concerns over cost, complexity, and fiduciary responsibilities.

The move is opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the public, but it appeases the hard-right parties essential to his coalition's survival. These parties advocate for annexing and resettling Gaza, a goal most Israelis do not support. The article argues that Netanyahu is beholden to this far-right faction, shaping his wartime decisions to maintain his grip on power.</p>
