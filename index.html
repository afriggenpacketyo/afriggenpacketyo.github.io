          <h2>European Pharmaceutical Industry Prepares for Potential Tariff Impacts from the United States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 00:01:07 EDT</div>

          <p>Europe's pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential tariffs imposed by the U.S., which could significantly disrupt the free flow of medicines like insulin and heart treatments. President Trump has been promising higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals as part of his plan to reorder the global trading system and bring key manufacturing industries back to the United States. The move would have significant and uncertain consequences for drugs made in the European Union, the bloc's number one export to America, potentially affecting the availability and cost of vital medications for American consumers.</p>

          <p>Australia, once a top destination for international students, is now considering capping their numbers due to a housing crisis. Politicians argue that limiting international student intake will reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, thus lowering prices. This shift represents a significant change for Australia, which previously viewed international education as a major growth sector. While some worry about the economic impact of reduced student numbers, others argue for improved selection criteria rather than blanket bans.</p>

          <p>The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested by federal immigration authorities at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Key West, Florida, after a routine security check revealed her work visa had expired in 2017.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly deported three American children, aged 2, 4, and 7, along with their Honduran-born mothers. The deportations occurred in Louisiana and have sparked outrage from civil rights organizations, with the ACLU calling the actions illegal and inhumane. One of the children deported has a rare form of metastatic cancer and was allegedly deported without medication or medical consultations. A federal judge has raised questions about the legality of deporting a U.S. citizen in the case of the 2-year-old.</p>

          <p>Canada's upcoming election has seen a dramatic reversal of fortunes, with the Liberal party gaining ground after initially trailing behind the Conservatives. The shift is attributed to Justin Trudeau's resignation, Mark Carney's rise as Liberal leader, and the return of President Trump, whose policies have become a central issue. Carney is positioning himself as the leader best equipped to handle Trump's threats, while the Conservatives are struggling to adapt their message. The election's outcome will likely depend on which party can convince voters they have the best plan to deal with the U.S. president.</p>
