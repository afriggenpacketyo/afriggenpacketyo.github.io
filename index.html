        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has endorsed Senator JD Vance's view that a small minority of individuals are responsible for the majority of violent crime and should be imprisoned. Vance criticized the Democratic perspective that crime is "systemic," arguing this approach diffuses responsibility and leads to ineffective nonprofit funding. Musk added his agreement on the social media platform X, stating that having more sympathy for likely murderers than their potential victims is "disgusting." The exchange highlights a significant ideological divide on criminal justice policy and its underlying causes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The ruling centers on the legal interpretation of the "for cause" provision for removing a governor, with the judge suggesting it applies only to conduct while in office, not prior actions. The White House has vowed to continue its efforts to remove Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This case represents an unprecedented clash over the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, known for weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs, representing 11% of its workforce. This decision follows a profit warning and comes as the company faces intensified competition from rivals like Eli Lilly, maker of Mounjaro. The restructuring is the first major initiative by new CEO Mike Doustdar, who aims to simplify the organization and reduce costs by approximately £927 million. The move reflects the evolving and increasingly competitive landscape of the lucrative weight-loss drug market.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, has stated he anticipates the release of more "embarrassing" communications between himself and the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This follows the recent publication of a letter where Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal" over two decades ago. While expressing deep regret for the association and sympathy for Epstein's victims, Mandelson acknowledged he was "taken in" by Epstein's deception. The situation creates political difficulty for the UK government, which has so far maintained confidence in the ambassador.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington has cautioned that a new U.S. policy to shorten visas for Chinese journalists could lead to a "new round of 'media warfare'." The Department of Homeland Security proposed capping the stay for mainland Chinese journalists at 90 days, a significant reduction from previous employment-based durations. An embassy spokesperson labeled the move a "discriminatory step" and a retreat from prior commitments by the United States. This development marks another point of friction in the already strained diplomatic and media relations between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has characterized President Trump's repeated threats to send National Guard troops to Chicago as a political power grab rather than a genuine effort to combat crime. Pritzker alleges that Trump's goal is to normalize military intervention in civilian areas ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. While Trump lacks the authority to deploy troops without the governor's request, the Department of Homeland Security has initiated "Operation Midway Blitz" to arrest individuals without legal status. The conflict underscores a deep-seated dispute over federal versus state authority and immigration enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis argues that the rise of originalism, a judicial philosophy championed by the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has effectively killed the practice of amending the U.S. Constitution. The article posits that as amending became politically impossible due to polarization, both conservatives and liberals shifted their focus to influencing the judiciary to achieve constitutional change. This has led to highly politicized Supreme Court nominations and trapped constitutional interpretation in a rigid view of the past. The author contends this shift has weakened representative government and contributed to an insurrectionary political style by removing a key mechanism for peaceful change.</p>

          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales, Sir Andy Cooke, has stated that the police practice of recording "non-crime hate incidents" is no longer required. He argued that intelligence can be gathered differently and that people should be allowed to speak openly without fear of their opinions being recorded by police. Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not meet the criminal threshold. The comments contribute to a wider debate in the UK about the policing of speech, particularly online, and balancing free expression with data collection on potential escalations of hate.</p>

While the move aims to reduce "payment friction" for larger purchases, it has raised concerns about potential fraud and theft.

The recall effort stems from public anger over the council members' support for new development projects, including high-rise condos, which critics say violate the town's comprehensive plan.

          <p>A new forecast from the Rhodium Group indicates that a recent increase in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions has contributed to a rise in global pollution during the first half of this year. The report warns that the Trump administration's pro-fossil fuel policies will significantly slow the country's decarbonization pace, reducing expected emissions cuts by 2035 by nearly half compared to previous projections. This policy shift, which includes abandoning Paris Agreement targets and promoting drilling, moves the U.S. further away from its climate goals.

The proposal would require the federal government to establish a "regulatory sandbox," a secure testing environment where AI firms could apply for temporary waivers from specific regulations that hinder their product development. For instance, a company could request a modification to HIPAA rules to test a cancer-screening tool, provided it doesn't compromise patient privacy. The initiative reflects a concern that the U.S. risks falling behind competitors like China if AI development is overly burdened by existing regulations.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that people tend to consume more sugar during hot weather, primarily through an increase in the consumption of sugary beverages like sodas and energy drinks. By analyzing years of U.S. grocery receipts and corresponding weather data, researchers found that sugar intake rose with each degree of temperature increase. The study, published in Nature Climate Change, suggests that as global temperatures rise due to climate change, Americans' annual sugar intake could increase further. This trend raises public health concerns, as high sugar consumption is linked to numerous health problems including diabetes and heart disease.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 30-day emergency authority over the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is scheduled to expire, with Congress not expected to grant an extension. Trump invoked the Home Rule Act in August to declare a "crime emergency," placing the local police under federal oversight. While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has credited the federal intervention with a drop in crime, she has also stated the city does not need a presidential emergency and can request federal resources through existing frameworks. The takeover has renewed debate over D.C.'s home rule and its autonomy from the federal government.</p>

          <p>The Nepalese army is now patrolling the streets of Kathmandu after anti-corruption protests escalated into widespread violence, arson, and the storming of parliament. The unrest, which led to the prime minister's resignation and more than 20 deaths, has been partially disavowed by the "Gen Z" organizers who initiated the movement. They claim their peaceful protests were "hijacked" by opportunistic infiltrators responsible for the destruction. While the military has called for peace talks, a leadership vacuum and nationwide curfews have left the Himalayan nation in a state of profound crisis, its worst in decades.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request for an expedited hearing to appeal lower court rulings that declared many of the president's tariffs illegal. The case, which consolidates two separate challenges from small businesses and states, will be heard in the first week of November. At issue are the "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on numerous countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration argued for a fast-tracked process, warning that it could be forced to refund up to $1 trillion in collected duties if a negative ruling were delayed.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine by cutting off a major source of its revenue. This request was made during a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials, with Washington indicating it would be prepared to mirror any tariffs Europe imposes. The proposal represents a significant escalation in the use of secondary sanctions to influence the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that China, not Russia, will be the primary beneficiary of the proposed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline. As Western sanctions have forced Moscow to pivot its energy exports away from Europe, Russia has become increasingly dependent on the Chinese market. This shift in dynamics gives Beijing significant leverage in negotiations over the pipeline's terms and gas pricing. The analysis concludes that while the project is crucial for Russia to find new buyers for its gas, China can use its powerful position to secure a deal that is highly favorable to its own economic and strategic interests.</p>

This AI-powered "third hand" can perform routine tasks such as retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, freeing up the surgeon to focus on more complex aspects of the procedure. Published in the journal Science Robotics, the innovation aims to alleviate the strain on surgeons and potentially reduce patient wait times, especially as aging populations increase clinical demand.
