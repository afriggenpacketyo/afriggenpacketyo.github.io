          <p>ESPN has signed a five-year deal, reportedly worth an average of $325 million annually, to exclusively stream WWE's premium live events in the United States starting in 2026. This package, which includes major events like WrestleMania and the Royal Rumble, will be featured on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform. The move is seen as a strategic partnership to expand the WWE's audience and provide ESPN with content that attracts a younger, more diverse, and more female demographic beyond traditional sports. The deal shifts the rights from NBCUniversal's Peacock, which previously held them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney announced fiscal third-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to significant growth in its streaming business and strong performance from its theme parks. The company's direct-to-consumer streaming unit, which was losing a billion dollars per quarter just two years ago, is now showing a solid foundation and helping to offset declines in traditional television revenue. Despite overall revenue slightly missing projections, domestic parks saw a 10% revenue increase, with officials noting strong consumer spending. Disney also raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance, signaling confidence in its financial trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Drugmaker Novo Nordisk is reinforcing its direct-to-consumer sales strategy for its popular weight-loss drug Wegovy to counter competition from copycat compounders and address U.S. government demands for lower drug prices. The company's NovoCare platform offers the drug at a significantly reduced cash price, a move its CFO stated is key to regaining market share. This comes as the Trump administration pressures pharmaceutical firms to cut prescription drug costs, with Novo Nordisk expressing a shared goal of price reduction while continuing negotiations on policy specifics. The company also noted that competition from compounded drugs remains a significant factor impacting its U.S. sales forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sudden and extreme downpour, known as a cloudburst, has caused devastating flash floods in the village of Dharali in India's northern state of Uttarakhand. The event has left more than 100 people missing, including at least 10 soldiers, and has resulted in at least one confirmed death. Rescue operations are underway but are being hampered by damaged roads and heavy sludge from the overflowing Kheerganga river. This region of the Himalayas is highly vulnerable to such disasters, with this event recalling previous deadly floods in 2013 and 2021.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent standoff by Texas Democratic legislators, who left the state to block a Republican redistricting plan, is part of a long history of lawmakers using this tactic to halt legislative action. This practice, known as "breaking quorum," has been employed in Texas for over 150 years, with notable instances in 2021 over a voting restrictions bill and in 2003 over a previous redistricting effort. On past occasions, authorities have attempted to track down and even issue arrest warrants for the absent lawmakers, though they lack jurisdiction outside of Texas. The article details how these walkouts have historically ended, often after one or more special sessions, with varying degrees of success and consequences for the participants.</p>

The terminated projects, which include proposals from major pharmaceutical companies, were primarily aimed at developing vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza. Kennedy stated that HHS has determined the technology poses more risks than benefits for these viruses, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts who argue it undermines pandemic preparedness. The administration plans to reallocate the funds to what it describes as "safer, broader vaccine platforms."</p>

The article describes a humanitarian catastrophe, with millions displaced and facing starvation, where violence and nihilism have replaced any sense of order.

Kittle, who says he regularly uses the substance for an energy boost, jokingly remarked that he "considered retirement" upon hearing the news. The league memo cited a 2024 FDA warning about the lack of evidence for the safety or efficacy of ammonia inhalants and their potential to mask neurological symptoms, including signs of a concussion.

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a 42-year-old conservative historian backed by former President Donald Trump, has been inaugurated as the new president of Poland. His presidency could shift the country toward a more nationalist stance and create challenges for the centrist government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. In his inauguration speech, Nawrocki affirmed his commitment to NATO and the EU but stated he would oppose any transfer of Poland's sovereign powers to the European Union. Nawrocki's rapid political rise and campaign, which echoed themes popular on the American right, have been controversial, with supporters praising his traditional values and critics pointing to past scandals.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that financially troubled football clubs like Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe can "absolutely" be saved from collapse. Her comments come as both clubs face severe issues, including delayed wage payments and registration embargoes. Nandy emphasized that a new independent football regulator, set to launch later this year, will have the power to intervene, including forcing owners to sell in dire circumstances and giving fans greater influence. She stressed the importance of these clubs to their communities and cited the need for responsible ownership, referencing the collapse of Bury FC in 2019 as a catalyst for the new legislation.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a significant "confidence gap" among families regarding college costs, with many feeling prepared after acceptance letters but overwhelmed when the first tuition bills arrive. Despite the rising sticker price of college, which can exceed $100,000 annually at some schools, the average amount families actually spend is closer to $31,000, covered by a mix of savings, scholarships, and loans. The article notes that many families are not fully utilizing key financial tools; for instance, only 71% submit the FAFSA for federal aid, and fewer than a third use tax-advantaged 529 savings plans, often due to a lack of awareness about the plans' benefits and uses.

One Ohio woman describes losing her marriage, home, and health to an addiction to a kratom tonic she mistook for a harmless energy drink. Medical experts explain that while kratom is a plant, it has addictive potential with effects and withdrawals similar to opioids, yet it remains largely unregulated in most states.

          <p>A new movement of people calling themselves "AI vegans" is emerging, choosing to abstain from using artificial intelligence for ethical, environmental, and personal wellness reasons. The article compares this digital abstention to dietary veganism, noting that both are driven by a desire to reduce harm, whether to animals or, in this case, to the environment and human cognition. The author points to the significant energy and water consumption of AI models and studies suggesting that overreliance on tools like ChatGPT can harm critical thinking. While mass adoption of "AI veganism" seems unlikely, the concept encourages greater awareness of the hidden costs associated with our increasing consumption of AI.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Reverend Al Sharpton contends that on the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, American democracy is in a more precarious state than when the law was passed. He argues that the erosion of voting protections, accelerated by the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision and perpetuated by the Trump administration, has led to widespread disenfranchisement and a system as "rigged as ever." Sharpton calls for renewed activism, announcing a March on Wall Street to leverage the economic power of Black voters against corporations that do not support their rights. He frames the current struggle as a fight to prevent a regression to an era of systemic voter suppression.</p>

The facility, which houses over 900 immigrants in tents with no running water, was established under emergency powers by Governor Ron DeSantis. The article highlights harsh conditions, including extreme heat, bugs, and questionable medical access, as well as the use of inexperienced security contractors. While some Republican leaders are celebrating the facility with merchandise, the report notes that the aggressive approach is not popular with all conservative voters in Miami, many of whom find the conditions inhumane.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its plummeting birth rate, China has announced it will waive tuition fees for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also includes tuition reductions for children in approved private kindergartens, is part of a broader plan to make preschool education free and lower the financial burden on families. The central government will subsidize kindergartens to offset the lost revenue, sharing the cost with local governments. This move aims to provide financial relief to households struggling with a slowing economy and a weak labor market, thereby encouraging more parents to have children.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California must reconsider its policy that bars the hiring of undocumented students for on-campus jobs. The court found that the UC system's justification for the discriminatory policy—fear of potential federal litigation—was insufficient legal grounds. While the ruling does not force the university to overturn the policy, it requires a re-evaluation based on proper legal criteria. This decision is a significant win for immigrant rights advocates, who argue the ban violates state law and forces students into the underground economy, depriving them of crucial career and educational opportunities.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, moments after he declared victory in the California Democratic primary. It details how Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Jordanian immigrant with a deep-seated hatred for Israel, shot Kennedy in a kitchen pantry. The piece explores Sirhan's motives, his trial, and the subsequent decades of conspiracy theories that have attempted to posit a second gunman, despite Sirhan's own confessions and journal entries. The narrative contrasts the hope Kennedy inspired in a tumultuous decade with the bitter political resentments that culminated in his murder.</p>

One recent DIY project near Stoner Park in Sawtelle was initially removed by the Department of Transportation, but after a community outcry, officials reversed course and agreed to install permanent crosswalks. The incident highlights a broader tension between citizen-led safety initiatives and official city processes, which are often hampered by backlogs and funding constraints.

The move is overwhelming immigration courts and lawyers, who must quickly track down clients and file opposition.
