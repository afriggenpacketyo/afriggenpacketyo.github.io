          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was reportedly ticketed for speeding and failed to appear in court. Sanders was pulled over for driving 101 mph in a 60 mph zone, and previously ticketed in a separate incident. Questions about Sanders' character arose prior to the draft, with concerns raised about his attitude and behavior. Sanders' representatives have stated that he is taking care of the tickets, and he is currently competing for a starting role with the Browns. Optimism remains that he can mature and become a valuable asset to the team.</p>

          <p>European and US officials are worried about China's economic overcapacity and its potential impact on global markets. Overinvestment, state subsidies, and weak domestic consumption in China have led to an overflow of industrial production. There are fears that Chinese companies will flood European markets with discounted goods, harming local industries and jobs. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed concern about a new 'China shock' affecting global markets. The EU and US are pushing China to address these issues to avoid a trade backlash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, potentially due to a high-pressure nitrogen tank failure. The explosion occurred during preparations for a test firing of the rocket's Raptor engines. This incident is reminiscent of a 2016 Falcon 9 explosion, though SpaceX claims no commonality between the tank designs. The explosion may impact the timeline for the program's tenth integrated flight test, which NASA is relying on for its Artemis moon mission, though NASA has expressed confidence in SpaceX's ability to resolve the issue and move forward with the program.</p>

          <p>This article reviews the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was signed in 2015 by Iran and several world powers, including the United States. The deal aimed to restrict Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA in 2018, reimposing economic sanctions on Iran. Since then, Iran has reduced its compliance with the deal, and tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated, making the future of negotiations uncertain.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft resigned as a government whip in protest against planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed understanding for the need to address the welfare bill, but disagreed with cutting personal independence payments and universal credit. The government is introducing a bill that tightens eligibility criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit. The government insists these reforms will ensure those who can work are supported, while protecting those with the most severe disabilities, though Labour MPs have expressed concern about the bill.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of Congress are being denied access to immigrant detention facilities, which experts say is a violation of congressional oversight powers. A federal statute states that funds cannot be used to prevent members of Congress from entering facilities used to detain aliens. The Department of Homeland Security claims visits require advance notice for security reasons, but lawmakers argue the administration is trying to hide poor conditions and lack of attorney access. Some representatives are considering legal action to compel access, asserting the administration is operating outside the bounds of the law.</p>

Local and state policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced plastic bag waste collected during shoreline cleanups by up to 47%. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full bans, and partial bans were the least effective. California's efforts to curb plastic waste have seen mixed results, with a statewide ban initially reducing litter but later leading to an increase in plastic bag waste due to loopholes. New stricter laws with fewer loopholes can make a measurable difference.</p>
