        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This action marks the first use of "golden share" rights, a condition established during the company's $14.1 billion acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. These rights grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures, showcasing a significant expansion of governmental influence in the private sector. The administration emphasized its commitment to protecting American jobs and manufacturing capabilities as part of the national security agreement tied to the takeover.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump held a nearly two-hour phone conversation, which both sides described in positive terms, fostering hopes for improved bilateral relations. During the call, they discussed trade issues and a potential deal concerning TikTok, with Trump announcing plans for a meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a visit to China early next year. Despite the constructive dialogue, analysts remain cautious, pointing to persistent friction points such as tensions in the South China Sea, the status of Taiwan, and potential U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris expresses reservations about the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports, a topic she largely avoided during her presidential campaign. She acknowledges the concerns of parents and athletes regarding biological factors like muscle mass, suggesting a common-sense approach is needed without demonizing transgender individuals. The article notes that this issue was a significant factor in the 2024 election and contrasts her current statements with her campaign's messaging, also mentioning that former President Biden held similar private views.</p>

          <p>The United States has noticeably reduced public announcements of its warships transiting the Taiwan Strait since Donald Trump returned to office, with only three known operations compared to the regular declarations under the previous administration. Beijing, which has historically protested the "public hype" of these transits, has been quieter in its response to the less-publicized operations. While some observers see this as a tactical shift to de-escalate tensions, the U.S. has continued to confirm the transits when asked, suggesting the underlying policy of freedom of navigation remains unchanged despite the change in communication strategy.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, driven by rising tuition costs and political turmoil within the United States. Data indicates a significant increase in U.S. students studying abroad over the past five years, with consultants noting a surge in interest following the 2024 election. While the lower cost of international education is a primary motivator, some students also cite concerns about safety and the political climate as reasons for seeking opportunities overseas. The article explores both the benefits, like cultural exposure, and the potential drawbacks, such as challenges entering the U.S. job market.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologist Warns of UVA Ray Exposure Risk Even When Indoors Near Windows</h2>

          <p>A dermatologist highlights the often-overlooked danger of UVA ray exposure, even for those indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are linked to accelerated aging and skin cancer. This "silent" exposure can occur without any visible signs like burning. To ensure comprehensive protection, it is recommended to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, which shields against both types of ultraviolet radiation, especially when spending extended time near windows.</p>

          <p>Louisa Serene Schneider, a former Wall Street executive, founded the ear-piercing company Rowan from her attic after identifying a market gap for a safe, medically supervised piercing experience. The business, which employs registered nurses, has grown significantly, now operating 90 studios across the U.S. and generating over $70 million in annual revenue. Schneider's journey involved overcoming skepticism from investors and bootstrapping the company initially before securing substantial funding. Rowan's success is built on combining medical safety with a celebratory customer experience, and it is projected to reach $150 million in revenue by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 migrants crossed the English Channel in small boats on a single day, bringing the total for the year to a record high of over 32,000. This influx occurred as the UK government began implementing a new "one-in-one-out" deal with France, which saw two men deported on the same day. Under the agreement, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept another with a strong asylum case. While the government hopes this will deter crossings, critics have called the initial number of returns "pathetic" and questioned the plan's effectiveness.</p>

Sultana, who is now consulting defamation lawyers, has described the internal politics as a "sexist boys' club," revealing deep divisions within the fledgling political movement even before its official launch.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food industry experts identify three primary factors driving the recent surge in U.S. grocery prices: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change, and a shortage of agricultural labor. Tariffs have increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has disrupted domestic farming, forcing production to move to other regions. Additionally, restrictive immigration policies and a lack of interest in agricultural work have created a labor deficit. These combined pressures lead to higher costs for producers, which are then passed on to consumers through price hikes and "shrinkflation." (not investment advice)</p>

This market reaction highlights a disconnect between the central bank's actions and investor sentiment about the long-term economic outlook.

          <p>In a highly unusual and dramatic conclusion to the heptathlon at the World Championships in Tokyo, Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson shared the bronze medal with American Taliyah Brooks. After seven events, both athletes finished with an identical score of 6,581 points, leading to the first-ever split medal in the history of the world heptathlon. The emotional outcome marked a significant moment for Johnson-Thompson, who secured her third consecutive major podium finish at the same stadium where she suffered a career-threatening injury during the Olympics four years prior. American Anna Hall won the gold medal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, a dramatic increase from previous administrative costs. The order, which cites "abuse" of the program, is intended to compel companies to prioritize hiring American workers. The move has drawn sharp criticism from immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue it will stifle innovation and American competitiveness, particularly for small businesses and startups that rely on international talent. The tech industry, a major user of the H-1B program, is expected to be significantly impacted.</p>

          <p>A retired grandfather's persistent heartburn and inability to eat were symptoms of a rare and serious condition called chronic mesenteric ischemia, caused by blocked arteries restricting blood flow to his small intestine. After significant weight loss and numerous tests, he was diagnosed and successfully treated with a minimally invasive stent procedure at Northwestern Medicine. The condition can lead to severe pain, malnutrition, and potentially fatal complications if left untreated. His story highlights the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare and seeking further opinions when initial diagnoses are inconclusive.</p>

          <p>National assessment results from 2024 show a significant decline in the academic performance of U.S. high school seniors, with reading and math scores falling to their lowest levels in decades. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), average reading scores are now lower than in 1992, and math scores are the lowest since 2005. Experts point to a continuing downward trend that predates the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increasing percentage of students performing below the "basic" achievement level. Factors cited include chronic absenteeism, increased screen time, and declining student engagement.</p>

The public sector has historically been a crucial pathway to middle-class stability for this demographic, offering more equitable pay and benefits than the private sector. The article details the personal and psychological toll on those who have lost their jobs or face an unstable work environment, leading to increased anxiety and a loss of community. This trend has contributed to nearly 300,000 Black women exiting the U.S. labor force in just three months.</p>

The massive availability of private funding allows these companies to delay going public while still achieving enormous growth. While OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged the market is in a "bubble," he also signaled plans for massive spending on infrastructure to advance AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

The residency invited a massive influx of "concert tourists," creating a tension between the economic benefits and the potential negative impacts on housing and local infrastructure.

          <p>Germany is modernizing its traditionally strict burial laws, with two states, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, introducing significant reforms. The new legislation will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers, allow families to keep cremation urns at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes. These changes reflect a societal shift towards more personalized and varied forms of mourning, driven by secularization and changing family structures. While the move is welcomed by funeral directors, it has drawn criticism from Christian churches and conservative politicians concerned about the decline of traditional cemeteries.</p>

          <p>A reported pause on a $400 million weapons aid package to Taiwan by the Trump administration has raised concerns that the U.S. is using the island as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China. The move, which has not been officially confirmed, came just before a phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where Taiwan was notably not mentioned in official readouts. Analysts suggest that while this may be a temporary tactical concession to secure a trade deal, it creates an opportunity for Beijing to exploit and could signal a cooling of U.S. support for Taiwan's defense.</p>

The article points to the immediate, widespread blaming of "the left" for the killing and subsequent threats to investigate and punish political opponents as evidence of this pattern. It serves as a warning that American democracy is in a precarious moment, facing unprecedented assaults from within the government.</p>
