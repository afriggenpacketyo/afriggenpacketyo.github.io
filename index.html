          <h2>Devastating Texas Floods Claim Over 100 Lives Amid Scrutiny of Official Warnings</h2>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas resulted in at least 109 fatalities, with dozens of people, including summer campers, still missing. The disaster was caused by a combination of a tropical system, a low-level jet stream, and the region's natural flood-prone geography, which led to a rapid and massive rise in water levels. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the timing and adequacy of emergency warnings, as many residents reported receiving no alerts before the deluge. The event has prompted a major disaster declaration and a massive search and recovery operation involving state and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River, confirmed that at least 27 of its campers and counselors were killed in the recent Texas flash floods. As search efforts continue for the remaining missing individuals, stories of the victims, many of whom were young children, are emerging, highlighting the human cost of the tragedy. The camp's owner, Dick Eastland, also died while attempting to rescue campers. The disaster has left the community devastated, with officials warning families about scams attempting to exploit their uncertainty and grief.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially ended the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security checks at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the immediate policy change, citing significant advancements in security technology over the years. The rule, which was implemented nationwide in 2006, originated after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. While this change streamlines the process for regular travelers, rules for removing belts, coats, laptops, and liquids from bags remain in effect for now.</p>

          <p>As the death toll from the Texas flash floods surpassed 100, with over 160 people still missing, authorities are facing difficult questions regarding the timeliness of their emergency response. During a press conference, officials appeared to evade inquiries about when they were first alerted to the danger and why a more robust warning system wasn't in place, insisting their priority remains on recovery efforts. The National Weather Service had issued a "life-threatening" alert hours before officials say they were made aware of the situation. This scrutiny highlights a critical debate over preparedness and communication during natural disasters.</p>

This sale follows another significant divestment of over $730 million in shares at the end of June.

The bow was torn from the heavy cruiser in November 1942 during the Battle of Tassafaronga when it was struck by a Japanese torpedo, an incident that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the remaining crew heroically saved the ship, sailing it to Australia for temporary repairs.

Key recommendations include carefully calculating deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties and shopping at online banks, which often offer higher rates. Once a high-rate CD is found, experts urge savers to lock in the rate promptly, as comments from the Fed could shift the rate climate even if no immediate cut occurs.

          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is expected to have his Senate confirmation hearing next week. Waltz, a former congressman, previously served as Trump's national security adviser before stepping down after a controversy involving a sensitive Signal chat group. The nomination followed the withdrawal of the president's initial choice, Rep. Elise Stefanik. Waltz is anticipated to face sharp questioning from Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Signal incident and the administration's recent military actions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have arrested and charged four men, two of whom are active members of the Canadian Armed Forces, for allegedly plotting to form an anti-government militia. The group is accused of conducting military-style training and planning to "forcibly" seize land in the Québec City area. A police search uncovered a significant cache of explosive devices, dozens of firearms, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The arrests underscore growing concerns about extremism within the Canadian military, following a 2022 report on the rise of members with ties to extremist groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension "triple lock" policy will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times its original estimate. The triple lock guarantees the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR noted that high inflation and earnings volatility have driven up the cost, placing the UK's public finances in a "vulnerable position." Despite the rising costs, the government has stated its commitment to maintaining the current policy to support pensioners. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The passage of major cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid and food assistance has reignited a long-standing debate among progressives about the best approach to social welfare policy. Proponents of universal programs, like Social Security, argue they are more politically durable because they serve a broader population, whereas means-tested benefits targeting only the poor are more vulnerable to cuts. This article argues that the history of social policy in the U.S. is more complex, with some universal programs being cut and many means-tested programs having grown significantly over the past few decades, suggesting universality is not the sole determinant of a program's political resilience.</p>

While the District of Columbia has home rule, Congress retains final oversight of its laws and budget.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have reached their highest levels since tracking began in the 1980s, impacting both consumers and restaurants. The primary cause is a classic supply and demand imbalance, with robust consumer demand for beef coinciding with the smallest national cattle herd since the 1960s. This herd reduction has been driven largely by years of widespread drought, which diminished feedstock and forced ranchers to liquidate their stock. Due to the long biological cycle of cattle, experts predict it will take several years to rebuild herds, meaning prices are likely to remain elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike previous darker takes, this version embraces a lighthearted, whimsical tone reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons.
