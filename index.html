          <p>An armed man, identified as 42-year-old Joshua Runkles, was arrested outside State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the site of a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. According to the Secret Service, Runkles was exhibiting suspicious behavior and falsely claimed to be a law enforcement officer while carrying a weapon. He was taken into custody and booked for impersonating an officer and carrying a weapon in a prohibited place. The incident occurred ahead of the high-security memorial, which is designated a top-level national security event.</p>

          <p>A significant rift has emerged within the New York Democratic Party after State Chairman Jay Jacobs refused to endorse Zohran Mamdani, the party's Democratic socialist nominee for New York City mayor. Jacobs cited fundamental policy disagreements, particularly on how to address income inequality and Mamdani's criticisms of Israel, as the reason for his decision. This public break has created a difficult situation for Governor Kathy Hochul, who has endorsed Mamdani, and has raised questions about Jacobs' future leadership within the state party.</p>

          <p>Correctional officers at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco are pleading with the state to reverse its decision to close the facility by 2026. In letters to the Attorney General, the officers argue the prison has available space and robust rehabilitation programs that could help alleviate severe overcrowding in county jails. However, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation maintains that the prison was selected for closure due to significant infrastructure costs, its aging wooden facilities, and uneven terrain that limits accessibility.</p>

          <p>A renewed threat of flash flooding is emerging for the Desert Southwest as another surge of monsoonal moisture moves into the region. This follows recent deadly flooding in Barstow, California, where a two-year-old was swept away by floodwaters. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen and is expected to become a hurricane over the weekend. Forecasters predict the storm will remain far from land, curving northeastward into the open ocean without making landfall.</p>

The request comes after the House passed a short-term Republican spending bill that failed in the Senate, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown as both parties appear determined to blame the other for the impasse.</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old teacher from Atlanta, is documenting her life in the Japanese countryside, where she lives a more affordable and culturally rich life than she did in the U.S. After moving to the Chiba Prefecture to teach English, her employer helped secure her a one-bedroom apartment for just 35,000 yen, or about $238 a month. Smith shares her journey on social media to show an alternative to life in major cities like Tokyo and to demystify the experience of living abroad for others considering a similar move.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration protest in The Hague, Netherlands, descended into violence, prompting police to deploy tear gas and a water cannon to disperse the crowd. The demonstration, organized by a right-wing activist, saw protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police and damaging the office of a centrist political party. The unrest occurs just over a month before the country's snap general election, which was called after the previous ruling coalition collapsed over disagreements on migration policy, a central and divisive issue in Dutch politics.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing the Trump administration of using the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a pretext for a politically motivated campaign of vengeance against its opponents. In the days since the shooting, the administration has escalated rhetoric against the "radical left," considered classifying some groups as domestic terrorists, and pressured media outlets. Commentators argue this response fits an authoritarian playbook of exploiting a tragedy to consolidate power, crack down on dissent, and delegitimize political opposition, despite no evidence linking them to the crime.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a novel solution to the country's persistent asylum application backlog: using the Civil Contingencies Act. This legislation, typically reserved for wartime or major national emergencies, would be invoked to establish temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and rapidly hire thousands of additional caseworkers. The party argues this emergency measure is necessary to efficiently process claims, end the costly use of hotels to house asylum seekers, and create a more humane and effective system.</p>

          <p>Police in Sacramento have arrested a 64-year-old man for allegedly shooting into the lobby of the local ABC affiliate station, KXTV. The incident, in which at least three gunshots were fired into the building's window, occurred just one day after protesters had gathered outside the station to condemn ABC's suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. While a motive is still under investigation, the timing has raised concerns about escalating tensions and potential violence directed at media organizations. No one was injured in the shooting.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, figures within the Christian nationalist movement are casting him as a martyr, using his death as a rallying cry to energize their base and advance their political agenda. This article analyzes how Kirk's own career mirrored the rise of Trump-era Christian nationalism, shifting from secular conservatism to embracing a fervent spiritual culture war. His death is now being framed as a pivotal event in a holy war, with his widow's statement that his death ignited a "battle cry" being seen as a powerful call for accelerationism.</p>

          <p>Estonia has reported that three Russian fighter jets violated its airspace, remaining in sovereign territory for 12 minutes before being intercepted. The incident, described by Tallinn as an "unprecedentedly brazen" incursion, has prompted Estonia to invoke NATO's Article 4 to begin consultations with allies regarding the threat to its territorial integrity. Russia's Defense Ministry has denied the accusation, stating its aircraft flew in strict compliance with international regulations over neutral waters. This event significantly heightens tensions along NATO's eastern flank amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

In response, Ukrainian drones reportedly targeted major Russian oil refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions, causing explosions and fires.

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes surged to new record highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.

The positive market sentiment also lifted several major stocks, including Apple, which saw strong initial demand for its new iPhone 17 models, and Nvidia, following a new partnership with Intel.

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and have returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in Afghanistan for almost two decades, running a charitable training program. Their release was secured through negotiations brokered by Qatar, and they were emotionally reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to London. The Taliban had accused them of breaking Afghan laws but never specified the charges.</p>
