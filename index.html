          <p>Luke Donald, Europe's Ryder Cup captain, has cautioned the US team against expecting a simple repeat of Europe's previous victory, despite his team featuring 11 of the same 12 players. Donald emphasized that playing on American soil presents a different challenge that requires a distinct strategy, noting Europe's last away win was in 2012. He confirmed his six wildcard picks, all of whom played in the last event, but insisted that past pairings and lineups will not necessarily be replicated. Donald also downplayed concerns about a potentially hostile New York crowd, encouraging his players to embrace the atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reached an agreement to sign England defender Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, although the transfer is pending final clearance from Palace as they seek a replacement. The 25-year-old completed his medical and agreed to a long-term contract after the clubs settled on a fee. This move is part of a record-breaking summer spending spree for Liverpool, which has seen their total outlay exceed £450 million. Guehi's signing is intended to strengthen a defense that has appeared vulnerable early in the season, conceding six goals in their first three matches.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to criticize a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The move comes after her celebrated novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was removed from some school libraries under a new rule targeting materials with explicit sexual content. Atwood's new story sarcastically portrays two perfect children who marry and have a family without any biological realities, taking aim at Premier Danielle Smith. The Edmonton Public School Board has already removed over 200 books, including classics like "1984" and "Brave New World."</p>

A principle agreement signed in July, which aimed for a final deal by mid-August, has stalled.

          <p>A tragic all-terrain vehicle crash at an off-roading park in Piedmont, Alabama, has resulted in the deaths of two adults and injuries to seven children. Authorities reported that the ATV, a side-by-side RZR carrying nine people, overturned and struck a tree after hitting another vehicle. None of the occupants were wearing proper restraints, and the driver, who was ejected and died at the scene, was reportedly operating the vehicle at high speed. The remote location of the crash complicated rescue efforts, requiring park staff to escort emergency crews to the site.</p>

In the healthcare sector, Novo Nordisk shares increased following positive trial data for its weight-loss drug Wegovy.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over the purchase of a flat in Hove and her tax affairs. Conservatives have accused Rayner of hypocrisy for allegedly saving on stamp duty by declaring the flat as her main home to tax authorities while telling the local council it was a second home. Starmer defended Rayner, describing her as a "great story of British success" and stating that attempts to talk her down were a mistake.

          <p>A study by the University of Montpellier has found that human activities during the Middle Ages caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals. Researchers analyzed over 225,000 animal bones from southern France, spanning 8,000 years. They discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like foxes and deer shrank, while selective breeding caused domestic species such as sheep and chickens to grow larger. This marks a distinct shift from previous millennia where both groups evolved in similar size cycles.</p>

          <p>As the TV series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" nears its finale, intense fan debates over the main character's romantic choice have escalated into hostility, prompting the show's network to intervene. Passionate fans, divided into "teams" for rival love interests, have targeted the actors with online harassment. In response, Prime Video launched a campaign urging kindness and civility. A board-certified psychiatrist explains this behavior as a sign of parasocial relationships, where one-sided bonds with media figures can blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading to misplaced anger and resentment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on pharmaceutical companies to publicly "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs, citing public division over their effectiveness. His comments, made on social media, come amid significant leadership changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the recent firing of its director. Trump stated he has seen "extraordinary" information from companies like Pfizer but questioned why these results are not widely shared. The demand for transparency follows recent FDA approval of new COVID vaccines but only for individuals at higher risk of severe illness.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," highlights the unique democratic structure of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB), a world-renowned German orchestra. Founded by music students in 1980, the DKB operates with a grassroots approach where all 41 musicians have a say in artistic and operational decisions. This model, which gives members both rights and responsibilities, is credited with the orchestra's success and financial independence. The film follows the DKB and conductor Paavo Järvi as they passionately interpret the works of Joseph Haydn, drawing a parallel between the composer's freelance spirit and the orchestra's own ethos.</p>

          <p>A post-war redevelopment plan for Gaza, reportedly under consideration by the Trump administration, envisions transforming the territory into a "Gaza Riviera" through mass displacement and a decade of U.S. trusteeship. The 38-page document outlines the "voluntary" relocation of Gaza's two million residents in exchange for digital tokens while AI-powered smart cities and industrial hubs are constructed. The plan, developed by Israeli figures linked to a controversial foundation, would be financed by private investment in these mega-projects.

These industries heavily rely on an immigrant workforce, which has been crucial for sustaining the state's economy amid declining birthrates.
