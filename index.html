          <p>Microsoft has committed to spending an additional $4 billion to construct a second data center in Wisconsin, following a $3.3 billion investment in its first facility slated to open in 2026. The initial center will be equipped with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's advanced Blackwell GB200 chips, designed to handle intensive artificial intelligence workloads. The company emphasized its commitment to sustainability, planning to match its energy consumption with carbon-free sources, including a new solar farm. This expansion reflects the massive industry-wide race to build infrastructure capable of meeting the surging demand for AI services.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, causing its shares to drop by 8%. However, the company raised its full-year revenue growth forecast, citing strong performance in its casual dining brands which saw increased traffic from all income levels. Same-store sales grew 4.7%, with Olive Garden up 5.9% and LongHorn Steakhouse up 5.5%, offsetting weakness in its fine-dining segment. Executives attributed the success to value offerings and keeping menu price hikes below the rate of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two teenagers, aged 18 and 19, have been charged following a National Crime Agency investigation into a significant cyber attack on Transport for London (TfL). The hack, attributed to the group "Scattered Spider," caused major disruptions and millions in losses last year, compromising the personal data of approximately 5,000 customers. One of the accused was already on bail for other high-profile attacks and is alleged to have targeted U.S. healthcare companies, with prosecutors noting he bragged online about the potential risk to patients. The charges represent a key development in a complex investigation into threats against critical national infrastructure.</p>

The meeting follows Trump's earlier talks with Putin, which have not yet resulted in a dialogue with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.

          <p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr stated that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel appeared to have misled the public about the facts surrounding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Before ABC suspended the show, Carr had threatened regulatory action against the network and its parent company, Disney, arguing that the host's comments were not a joke but a deliberate misrepresentation of a significant political event. Carr asserted that the FCC grants broadcast licenses with an obligation to operate in the public interest, suggesting Kimmel's remarks constituted a serious violation of that trust and warranted potential agency intervention.</p>

          <p>Israeli author and psychotherapist Ayelet Gundar-Goshen explores the role of writing as resistance in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. She describes initially feeling that creating fiction was a selfish act amid the suffering of hostages and Palestinians, but was spurred on when Israeli officials called for boycotting art that humanizes Palestinians. Gundar-Goshen believes literature can be a tool to confront reality and explore the psychological dynamics of fear and aggression that shape the conflict. While she participates in street protests, she asserts that words have power, especially if they can help people examine their own blind spots and foster empathy.</p>

While the bank has cut rates five times since last year, recent data shows inflation ticking up again, driven partly by rising food costs.

          <h2>Attorneys General Oppose Trump Administration Rule Change to Student Loan Forgiveness Program</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 22 state attorneys general is formally opposing a proposed Trump administration regulation that would narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The rule change stems from a March executive order that would disqualify borrowers employed by organizations involved in work the administration disapproves of, such as those related to immigration. In a letter to the Department of Education, the attorneys general argue the vague language grants the administration broad authority to exclude employers it dislikes, undermining the program's promise of debt relief for public servants and hindering states' ability to recruit skilled workers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has successfully conducted a long-range drone strike on a major Gazprom-operated oil refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan region, located approximately 1,400 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Ukraine's SBU security agency described the attack as a strategic blow aimed at diminishing Russia's energy revenues, which fund its war effort. This strike is part of a broader campaign of attacks on Russian refineries that has contributed to rising domestic fuel prices and forced Moscow to extend a ban on gasoline exports. The incident highlights Ukraine's growing capability to hit critical infrastructure deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, a close confidant of President Trump and former U.S. ambassador to Germany, has threatened to revoke the journalist visa of a German correspondent for public broadcaster ZDF. The threat came after correspondent Elmar Thevessen made an inaccurate comment about the late Charlie Kirk and compared a White House official's beliefs to ideologies of the Third Reich. PEN International condemned the action as unworthy of a democracy, highlighting a radicalization of public debate. The incident adds to growing concerns among foreign journalists about press freedom in the U.S., amid separate plans to shorten the validity of their visas.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law signed by Governor Greg Abbott allows private citizens to sue anyone suspected of manufacturing, distributing, or mailing abortion pills within the state. The legislation, which takes effect in December, imposes penalties of at least $100,000 and is designed to create high liability for telehealth abortion services that operate under "shield laws" from other states. Despite the legal threats, some out-of-state providers have vowed to continue shipping medication to Texans, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over interstate abortion access. The law represents a new front in the anti-abortion movement's strategy.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund manager David Tepper commented that while the Federal Reserve has room for a few more interest rate cuts, excessive easing could push the economy into "danger territory." Speaking after the Fed's recent quarter-point reduction, Tepper cautioned that cutting rates too aggressively while inflation is not fully controlled could reignite price pressures and create asset bubbles. He noted that while market valuations are high, he remains constructive on stocks in the short term because of the central bank's current easing stance, stating, "I'm not ever fighting this Fed."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, state-backed campaign to control speech under the Trump administration. It contends that the FCC chairman's threat against Disney and ABC's subsequent capitulation demonstrate a dangerous precedent where government officials can silence media personalities for views they dislike. The author draws parallels to historical free speech cases, asserting that the right to express oneself, even in error, is fundamental and must be protected from powerful officials seeking to punish opposition. This trend, it warns, is a step towards authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has developed a remarkable habit of securing victories in the final moments of matches this season, scoring late winners in all five of their competitive games so far. An analysis shows the average time of their winning goal is after the 91st minute, a stark contrast to the previous season's average of 70 minutes. Manager Arne Slot attributes this success to the team's mentality, fitness, and preparation, allowing them to push for a result until the very end. The trend is notable for the involvement of veteran players, with over half the late-goal contributions coming from those aged 32 or older.</p>
