          <p>China has unveiled the Multi-hazard Alert Zero-gap and Universal (Mazu) system, an advanced AI-powered weather warning technology specifically developed to aid developing nations in preparing for and mitigating the impact of extreme weather events. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) highlights the system's expansive global reach and its crucial role in fostering an international early warning partnership network. Active co-development efforts are in progress with partners such as Ethiopia and Pakistan, utilizing China's Fengyun satellites that already provide services to 133 countries.

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has reinstated its financial guidance, anticipating a gradual recovery despite reporting a first-half net loss of 2.3 billion euros, a significant drop from the previous year. The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Fiat, updated its full-year tariff impact to roughly 1.5 billion euros, influenced by new U.S. and European trade agreements imposing a 15% tariff on most EU goods. CEO Antonio Filosa acknowledged 2025 as a "tough year" but expressed confidence in re-establishing profitable growth through "tough decisions." The article also notes a 13% year-on-year drop in net revenues, primarily from North America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand has accused Cambodia of "deliberately" violating a newly established ceasefire, which was intended to bring an end to five days of intense border clashes that have tragically claimed at least 33 lives and displaced thousands. While Cambodia's defense ministry denied any armed conflict since the midnight ceasefire, the Thai military reported continued gunfire from multiple Cambodian positions. Despite these accusations, local commanders from both nations held meetings as part of the agreement, aiming to halt troop movements and facilitate the collection of casualties. This fragile truce, brokered by Malaysia and influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump, underscores the ongoing volatility and deep-seated tensions along their disputed frontier.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump concluded his four-day visit to Scotland, engaging in discussions with First Minister John Swinney on key issues such as whisky tariffs and the Middle East. Swinney advocated for an exemption for Scotch whisky from a 10% U.S. tariff, which currently costs the industry £4 million per week, despite a recently agreed trade framework. During his visit, Trump also officially opened a new course at his Aberdeenshire golf resort and voiced strong opposition to wind turbines, labeling them "ugly monsters" and urging the UK to prioritize North Sea oil and gas. This trip, blending political meetings with private business interests, involved extensive security operations and generated considerable public attention.</p>

          <p>This article explores the intriguing history of collectible plush toys, focusing on the widespread popularity of the Japanese-designed Monchhichi in the 1980s and its distinct East German equivalent, the Tiemi. While Monchhichis gained global fame, particularly in West Germany, the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) developed the Tiemi, named after designer Susanne Tieme, to circumvent bans on capitalist imports. Produced in Sonneberg, a historic toy-making hub, the Tiemi became a beloved item across Eastern Bloc countries before its production ended following German reunification in 1990. These unique figures, including other "Sonni DDR" toys, are now highly prized by collectors, offering a glimpse into a unique segment of cultural and manufacturing history.</p>

While Newcastle also shows interest in Sesko, Aston Villa has firmly stated its disinterest in selling England international Watkins. However, United anticipates that Villa's position might become more flexible closer to the deadline, though they consider the rumored £60 million valuation for Watkins to be excessive.</p>

The experts propose that Asian values, fundamentally rooted in the principle of "harmony and diversity," should serve as the cornerstone for a return to consensus-based politics within the region, advocating for an open and collaborative approach rather than imposing a predetermined narrative on other nations.</p>

          <p>India has officially overtaken China as the primary exporter of smartphones to the U.S. in the second quarter, marking a substantial realignment in global manufacturing supply chains. This significant shift is largely attributed to Apple's accelerated strategy to diversify its production away from China, with India-assembled smartphones now comprising 44% of U.S. imports, a stark increase from just 13% a year prior. China's share, conversely, has diminished to 25%, while Vietnam's stands at 30%. This reorientation is heavily influenced by escalating trade uncertainties and the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration. Despite this surge, manufacturing efficiency, particularly yield rates, in India and Vietnam still lags behind China's established infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

The relentless storms have necessitated the relocation of over 80,000 residents and resulted in extensive damage, including significant power outages, severed communication lines, and compromised road infrastructure. Authorities took the drastic step of releasing water from a reservoir, which had reached its highest level since its construction in 1959, to mitigate further rising water levels. Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged immediate and robust rescue efforts as affected communities grapple with the sudden and overwhelming impact of the floods.</p>

His unwavering passion ultimately led him to Bengal, where he refined his skills despite facing initial skepticism and rejections. Under the mentorship of former India cricketer Arun Lal, Deep conquered self-doubt and recent family health challenges, notably dedicating his impressive Edgbaston performance to his sister, who recently battled cancer.</p>

Despite strong interest from member states, the ambitious plan faces challenges including higher energy costs, permitting delays, and the need for substantial private sector investment to fund the expensive infrastructure and power consumption requirements.

          <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) experienced a sharp decline in its share price, falling over 8%, following the announcement of a substantial 59% plunge in its net profit for the first financial quarter. The significant reduction to 186 million Singapore dollars was largely due to decreased interest income and considerable losses stemming from its 25.1% stake in Air India, particularly after its merger with Vistara. Industry analysts indicate that Air India's losses were more severe than anticipated and are expected to continue impacting SIA's bottom line, further exacerbated by a recent Boeing Dreamliner incident that reportedly led to a 20% drop in bookings. Despite these challenges and volatile geopolitical developments, SIA asserts that demand for air travel remains robust. (not investment advice)</p>

Uribe, a polarizing figure credited by many for combating insurgency but criticized for human rights violations, is expected to appeal the verdict. The ruling sparked clashes between his supporters and opponents, with reactions from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and current Colombian President Gustavo Petro highlighting the political divisions.</p>

The scheme, which is retroactive to early 2025, builds on pilot programs in various provinces.

          <p>A significant class action lawsuit has been initiated to challenge the Trump administration's controversial new policy, which mandates that undocumented immigrants arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) remain in detention without the possibility of bail.

Advocates contend that this "draconian interpretation" of the law inflicts "catastrophic" and "irreparable harm" upon tens of thousands of noncitizens and their U.S. citizen families, forcing them into prolonged detention.
