          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance for the Dodgers, pitching six scoreless innings with six strikeouts and allowing only one hit in a 2-1 win against the Atlanta Braves. Honored before the game with the National League's pitcher of the month award for March and April, Yamamoto showcased his dominance, carrying a no-hitter into the sixth inning and lowering his ERA to a league-best 0.90. Manager Dave Roberts praised Yamamoto's increased confidence, noting his evolution into the ace of the Dodgers' pitching staff amidst injuries to other key players. The article highlights Yamamoto's resilience and ability to overcome challenges, solidifying his status as a rising star in MLB. Optimism in baseball is often about the team's chances to win, so a player improving on his own record is good news for the team's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK achieved significant gains in the 2025 local elections across England, securing control of 10 councils and winning the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. The Liberal Democrats also made substantial gains, while both Labour and the Conservatives experienced major losses. The BBC's projected national share indicates a loosening grip of traditional parties on voters. Mayoral races presented a mixed picture, with Labour retaining three positions, Conservatives gaining one, and Reform UK securing two newly-created mayoralties.

The AfD, founded in 2013, has gained popularity by capitalizing on fears over migration and is now Germany's largest opposition party.

          <p>Water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire due to the Santa Ynez Reservoir being offline for repairs and the failure to bring an alternative reservoir online. Emails reveal that the city had planned to revive the Pacific Palisades Reservoir but ultimately deemed it unsafe due to structural issues. With both reservoirs unavailable, firefighters relied on smaller tanks that were quickly depleted, leading to reports of dry hydrants. A lawyer representing wildfire victims suggests the water supply issues played a role in the extent of the destruction, raising questions about the city's preparedness.

          <p>Australians are preparing to vote in an election that will determine who will lead the country through economic challenges like inflation and a housing crisis, and navigate complex relations with the United States and China.
