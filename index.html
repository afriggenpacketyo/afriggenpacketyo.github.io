          <p>Samsung Electronics reported better-than-expected operating profit and revenue for the first quarter, driven by robust sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The South Korean tech giant's revenue increased by 10% year-over-year, reaching 79.1 trillion Korean won ($55.4 billion), while operating profit rose by 1.5% to 6.7 trillion Korean won. While the company acknowledged macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and global growth slowdown, it anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year, provided these uncertainties diminish. Samsung is a leading manufacturer of memory chips and the world's second-largest smartphone maker.</p>

          <p>Mexico’s Attorney General Alejandro Gertz stated that an abandoned ranch in Teuchitlán, Jalisco, previously described as an "extermination camp" by groups searching for missing relatives, was used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel as a recruitment, training, and operations center. This conclusion was based on testimonials and documents. Gertz clarified that there is no definitive evidence of human cremations occurring at the ranch, despite earlier reports and the discovery of bone fragments. He explained that studies of the materials found did not indicate heat levels high enough for cremations, although investigations are still ongoing, including efforts to identify the bone fragments. Despite the Attorney General's statements, leaders of search groups maintain their belief that the ranch was used as an extermination site, citing their own findings at the location.</p>

          <p>Despite US President Donald Trump's emphasis on tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic agenda, recent White House and Treasury Department press releases highlighting his administration's achievements have made minimal direct mention of them. The documents instead focus on broader economic indicators such as job growth, investment, inflation, and regulatory cuts. Trump has defended his tariffs on China as a historic effort to curb job theft, but also suggested that China is willing to negotiate trade deals to avoid them. These claims come despite China's repeated denials of ongoing trade talks with the US.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is scheduled to hold a second round of talks with the United States in Washington to seek exemptions from higher duties affecting autos, steel, and other sectors. Japan aims to create a "win-win" relationship with the Trump administration, which has imposed the tariffs to reduce trade deficits and address perceived unfair trade practices. Japan is considering proposing increased imports of U.S.-grown soybeans and corn to alleviate excess supply caused by trade friction between Washington and Beijing. Japan is also exploring simplified safety and environmental screening for more imported cars.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were in housing, education, and food and non-alcoholic beverages, partially offset by falls in recreation, culture, furnishings, and household equipment. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut rates to 4.1% from 4.35% due to softening inflation, which had peaked at 7.8% in December 2022. The RBA expects growth in Australia's economy to pick up, with a strong labor market, but notes uncertainty about the global outlook.</p>

Other Democratic senators echoed Schumer's sentiments, with Senator Richard Blumenthal describing the administration as "cruel… and dumb." The White House responded by highlighting Trump's delivery on campaign promises, including border security and ending inflation, and promising further trade deals, peace deals, and tax cuts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump eased the impact of his new 25 percent tariffs on the auto industry, allowing American and foreign automakers producing vehicles in the United States to claim some reimbursements. This move, announced on his 100th day in office, aims to help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts to the United States over the next two years. Automakers can offset 15 percent of the suggested retail price of a U.S.-assembled automobile in the first year and 10 percent in the second year, with the offset arrangement stopping then. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also suggested that the United States is close to reaching a tariff deal with India.</p>

The payments, in the form of honoraria, meals, and travel expenses, violated the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, leading to false claims for Gilead's drugs to be paid by federal healthcare programs. One doctor who received over $300,000 in honorarium wrote prescriptions for Gilead HIV drugs resulting in over $6 million in Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare payments. Gilead stated it entered the agreement to avoid the cost and distraction of potential litigation.</p>

Canadian businesses are looking to Carney to restore order to commerce with the United States amid ongoing trade disputes. His framing of the campaign around Mr. Trump’s threats to Canada has elevated him to a global anti-Trump figure, but this could prove problematic if the two leaders talk in person.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed cumulative new tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods this year, leading to disrupted trade flows between the two countries.

However, concerns arise over a section that calls on the attorney general to pursue legal remedies against state and local officials for "obstruction" of law enforcement officers, particularly regarding federal immigration enforcement.

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, a major report on climate change mandated by Congress. The move has raised concerns about how the report will be written without the expertise of these scientists, many of whom were non-federal employees volunteering their time. The administration claims the "scope" of the assessment is being "reevaluated" to comply with the law. Critics fear the administration will proceed with its own report, assigning authors who represent alternative viewpoints on climate change.</p>

The protest targeted the home of Alejandro Oliveros Acosta, who was arrested on suspicion of felony animal cruelty after police alleged he killed at least a dozen neighborhood cats. Some protesters threw objects at a house believed to be a family member's and attempted to break down a fence, leading to police intervention and a report of vandalism and battery.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Justice has begun prosecuting migrants for entering a newly declared military buffer zone along the border with Mexico. At least 28 migrants were charged in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, for crossing into the militarized zone patrolled by active-duty US troops. The area was created with the transfer of 110,000 acres of federal land to the US army. Critics argue the militarization of the border represents a dangerous erosion of the constitutional principle that the military should not be policing civilians.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that walked back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing by raising the cost of production and squeezing their profits. The changes will modify Mr. Trump’s tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico, according to the orders. However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and aluminum that their suppliers pay and pass on. At a rally in Michigan on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that he was showing “a little flexibility” to the automakers but that he wanted them to make their components in the United States.</p>
