          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has identified the three deputies killed in a devastating explosion at a training facility. The victims, Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were all veteran members of the Special Enforcement Bureau's Arson Explosives Detail with a combined 74 years of service. The incident is considered one of the deadliest internal tragedies in the agency's history. Homicide detectives are investigating a possible connection to explosives seized by the same deputies the day before the blast.</p>

          <p>Despite the Dodgers losing 2-0 to the Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a promising performance in his second start since returning from injury. He pitched six strong innings, allowing only one run while demonstrating increased fastball velocity and a more confident, athletic approach on the mound. This outing marks a positive step for Glasnow, whose health and dependability are considered crucial for the Dodgers' long-term success and championship aspirations this season. The team is counting on him to bolster its starting rotation for the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China, focusing on countering the nation's "economic coercion." This comes after his government faced significant trade tariffs from Beijing in 2020 after calling for an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19. His testimony provides a contrasting perspective as his successor, Anthony Albanese, is currently working to improve diplomatic and trade relations with China. The hearing underscores the ongoing U.S. focus on China's global economic influence.</p>

          <p>A new study from China has found evidence that chemotherapy can sometimes awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. The research focused on breast cancer, offering a possible explanation for why metastasis can occur even after successful primary tumor treatment. The team also identified drugs that could inhibit this effect in mice, leading to a new clinical trial for human patients. This provides a potential strategy to improve future cancer treatments.</p>

The MoD stated it would "robustly defend" against legal action, citing a review that found it unlikely individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked list. The data breach compromised the details of over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation, raising significant safety concerns for those still in Afghanistan.</p>

This development aims to advance the military application of railgun technology, which has been hampered by insufficient firing power for effective warfare.</p>

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges for anti-money-laundering efforts and customer verification due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. This call for new regulations comes as the stablecoin market is rapidly growing, spurred by political support and increasing investor interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, confirmed the agency plans to use government data, including from Medicaid, to locate immigrants in the country illegally. He also stated he will continue to allow agents to wear masks during arrests, citing an 800% increase in attacks on officers, despite concerns about imposters. Lyons attributed the heightened tension to an expanded mission and the prevalence of "sanctuary" city policies.</p>
