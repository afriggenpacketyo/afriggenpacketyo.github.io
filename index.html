          <p>A political standoff is occurring in Texas after Democratic state lawmakers fled to prevent a vote on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent Democrats from office if they do not return, a move the lawmakers have defied. The proposed map could significantly favor Republicans in future elections, prompting Democrats to hold events in other states to draw national attention to the issue. This conflict highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting and its potential impact on control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma experienced a significant 23% drop on Monday, erasing a large portion of the gains from its successful initial public offering last week. The stock, which had more than tripled on its first day of trading, fell to $94.50 after closing at $122 on Friday. Despite the decline, the company's strong initial performance indicated a renewed market appetite for high-growth tech IPOs. Figma has distinguished itself from many tech startups by regularly posting profits alongside its rapid revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The governments of Ireland, Norway, and Spain have officially recognized the state of Palestine, a move that Ireland's prime minister hopes other European nations will soon emulate. The decision in Ireland, which comes over four decades after the country first called for a Palestinian state, is rooted in a historical sense of solidarity with colonized peoples. Israel has condemned the decision and recalled its ambassador from Dublin. Palestinian diplomats, however, view the recognition as significant progress toward self-determination and the establishment of a physical state.</p>

          <p>UFC fighter Conor McGregor is actively pursuing his previously announced intention to run for president of Ireland by launching a public petition. The petition seeks to modify the country's nomination process, which currently requires support from either 20 members of the Oireachtas or four county councils. McGregor argues this system restricts the direct voice of the electorate and is campaigning for a more inclusive process that would allow his name on the ballot. His political ambitions are linked to his opposition to the EU Migration Pact and criticism of the current Irish government.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is creating a massive demand for electricity, positioning GE Vernova as a key supplier of essential gas-fired turbines for new data centers. This surge has led to a significant increase in orders and a financial windfall for the company, with its stock price doubling this year. However, the industry faces challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the demand, with wait times for new turbines extending for years. This situation reflects a broader energy bottleneck in the AI revolution as tech giants race to secure power for their infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has urged police to publicly release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes, following a case in Warwickshire involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. Farage argued that a lack of transparency fuels online speculation and public unrest, drawing parallels to the aftermath of the Southport killings. Warwickshire Police have stated they follow national guidelines, which do not include sharing a suspect's immigration status after they are charged. The prime minister's office commented that transparency is important while acknowledging police operational independence.</p>

          <p>Two bakery owners in Paterson, New Jersey, were stabbed and slashed by a man who was allegedly angry about receiving the wrong sandwich four years prior. The assailant reportedly complained that an eggplant sandwich he was served in the past had made him ill. When the owners, brothers Abed and Mohammed Assad, attempted to de-escalate the situation, the man attacked them with a knife. Both victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and police are currently searching for the suspect, who remains at large.</p>

She noted the octopus had grown larger and seemed to recognize her son, becoming agitated and changing color.

          <p>An important but often misunderstood regulation, the 60% reverse mortgage rule, limits how much money homeowners can withdraw during the first year of a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). This FHA rule caps the initial withdrawal at 60% of the total available proceeds, unless a larger amount is needed to pay off existing mandatory obligations. While designed to prevent borrowers from depleting their home equity too quickly, this limitation can pose challenges for seniors needing immediate access to a larger lump sum. The regulation encourages long-term financial stability but requires careful planning from borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Catherine Hoggle, a Maryland woman with a history of severe mental illness, has been arrested again and charged with the murder of her two young children, who disappeared a decade ago. Sarah and Jacob Hoggle were 3 and 2 years old when they vanished in 2014 and have never been found. Hoggle was previously deemed incompetent to stand trial, leading to charges being dropped after a five-year limit. Following her recent release from a psychiatric hospital, a grand jury reindicted her on first-degree murder charges, marking a significant new turn in the long-running case.</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Brolin is making his first foray into the horror genre with the new film "Weapons," in which he plays a father searching for his vanished child. Brolin stated he was drawn to the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to explore themes of masculinity and vulnerability. Known for major roles in blockbusters like "Avengers" and "Dune," he explained that he typically avoided horror projects while raising his own children. He said the genre shaped his childhood, and he was intrigued by the idea of tackling something he was not sure he could do.</p>

Klingbeil expressed disappointment with the recent EU-U.S. tariff agreement, which sets a 15% duty on most EU goods, calling the outcome a setback. A key goal of his visit is to secure an exemption or a quota system for Germany's steel industry to protect jobs. The visit highlights Germany's concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs and its desire for stronger international coordination on trade policy.</p>

The union, IAM District 837, stated that the proposed contract did not adequately reflect the workers' skill and dedication. Boeing had offered a 20% general wage increase and other benefits, but the union held out for improved retirement benefits and higher pay for top-scale employees. The strike affects the assembly and maintenance of F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, though Boeing says it has a contingency plan in place.</p>

          <p>A statistical analysis reveals that the recent downward revisions to the U.S. jobs reports for May and June were exceptionally large by historical standards. The combined reduction of 258,000 jobs was the largest of its kind since at least 1979, outside of the early pandemic period. These significant revisions prompted President Donald Trump to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, whom he accused of manipulating the data. The data shows that while downward revisions have become more common recently, the magnitude of these specific changes was a statistical outlier.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultra-processed foods, even when the latter were designed to be healthy. Participants in the UK-based study ate fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat over eight weeks when consuming minimally processed foods. Surprisingly, those on the "healthy" ultra-processed diet also lost a small amount of weight by eating fewer calories than they typically would. The research suggests that the nature of food processing itself plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

Since installing the first phone last year, hundreds of calls have been made, proving useful for stranded drivers and for children needing to contact their parents.
