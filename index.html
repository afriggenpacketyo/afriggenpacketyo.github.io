          <p>A sudden cloudburst has triggered catastrophic flash floods in the village of Dharali in India's northern state of Uttarakhand, leaving more than 100 people missing, including at least 10 soldiers. The disaster, which occurred on Tuesday, caused a river to swell dramatically, submerging roads and buildings. Rescue efforts are being severely hampered by ongoing heavy rains and extensive infrastructure damage, making the area largely inaccessible to disaster response teams. While local media has reported four fatalities, officials have not yet confirmed any deaths as they struggle with poor connectivity and debris.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as India navigates escalating trade tensions with the United States, particularly following threats of increased tariffs from the Trump administration over India's trade with Russia. The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee described its stance as "neutral," indicating a cautious approach while assessing incoming economic data. Despite the global trade challenges, India's economy has shown robust growth and low inflation, providing a stable backdrop for the bank's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior UN official has issued a stark warning to the Security Council about the potential for "catastrophic consequences" if Israel proceeds with a reported plan to fully reoccupy the Gaza Strip. The warning follows Israeli media reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing for a total conquest to defeat Hamas, a move that has reportedly created division within Israel's own military leadership. The UN's Assistant Secretary General, Miroslav Jenča, stated such an expansion would endanger millions of Palestinians and the remaining Israeli hostages. He also highlighted the severe, ongoing humanitarian crisis, urging Israel to allow unimpeded aid into the territory.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country, creating a significant obstacle for the nation's fragile economic recovery. This move comes less than three months after the U.S. lifted long-standing sanctions following the collapse of the Assad regime. Although bilateral trade is minimal, analysts argue the tariff's symbolism sends a chilling message to potential investors and may be a political tool to maintain leverage over Syria's new transitional government. The policy is seen as counterproductive to reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country, which is grappling with a collapsed infrastructure and relies heavily on international aid.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks defeated the Indiana Fever 100-91, extending their own successful run to eight wins in their last nine games. The Fever, who were on a five-game winning streak, played without their star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury but remained an active presence from the bench. The Sparks capitalized on Clark's absence, with strong performances from Rickea Jackson and Kelsey Plum, who each scored 25 points. The victory solidifies the Sparks' position as they move closer to securing a playoff berth, benefiting from a recently stabilized and fully healthy roster.</p>

          <p>Italy's cabinet has passed a draft law that would impose stricter regulations on gender-affirming medical treatments for individuals under 18. The proposed legislation aims to control the provision of puberty blockers and hormones for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, requiring approval from a national ethics committee. The measure, backed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's conservative government, also calls for a national registry to monitor the use of these medications. While the government states the law is to protect minors' health, it has drawn significant protest from transgender rights advocates who see it as part of a broader agenda against LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

According to court documents, the company concealed the shipments' final destination by routing them through Singapore and Malaysia.

Citing the incident, Trump declared crime in the capital "totally out of control" and stated he would exert his powers to place D.C. under federal authority if the situation does not improve.

Only 27% of respondents said they would vote for a Republican today, a significant drop from the 45% who reported voting for Trump. The findings suggest growing dissatisfaction, with 63% of Latinos disapproving of Trump's job performance in July, potentially creating an opportunity for Democrats if they can capitalize on the shifting sentiment.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp's parent company, Meta, has announced that it disabled 6.8 million accounts linked to fraudulent activities in the first half of this year. The company stated many of these accounts were tied to criminal scam centers in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to target people worldwide with fake investment schemes. The crackdown coincides with WhatsApp rolling out new security features designed to alert users to suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact. This initiative is part of a broader effort to combat the rising tide of online scams conducted through messaging platforms.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a plan to ensure that only state institutions possess weapons by the end of the year, a move that would effectively disarm the militant group Hezbollah. The decision, heavily influenced by U.S. pressure, is part of implementing a November 2024 ceasefire agreement that followed over a year of hostilities with Israel. Hezbollah, which has long been more powerful than the national army, has stated it will not disarm while facing Israeli attacks. The plan is to be presented to the Cabinet by the end of August for approval.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported quarterly earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to slide, even as its revenue surpassed estimates. The company's CEO, Lisa Su, attributed some of the shortfall to U.S. export restrictions that eliminated sales of its MI308 AI chip to China, costing an estimated $800 million in the quarter. Despite this, AMD's data center and client segments saw significant year-over-year revenue growth. The company is optimistic about its next-generation AI chips, noting strong interest from major AI firms looking for alternatives to Nvidia's market-dominant products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling follows a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funds without congressional approval. The judge stated the move could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone communities that rely on the funding for mitigation projects like stormwater management. FEMA had previously called the program "wasteful" but recently walked back comments about its termination, stating it was still under evaluation.</p>

          <p>Rapper and producer Sean "Diddy" Combs has reportedly contacted Donald Trump to seek a presidential pardon, according to a source close to his legal team. Combs was recently convicted on prostitution-related charges and is awaiting sentencing in October, where he faces up to 20 years in prison. In a recent interview, Trump acknowledged that he had been approached about the matter but seemed hesitant, noting that Combs had been "very hostile" toward him politically. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on any specific clemency request. Combs was recently denied bail ahead of his sentencing.</p>

          <p>A massive, China-backed copper mining project in Afghanistan is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year after being stalled for 17 years. The state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) won the contract for the Mes Aynak Mine in 2008, but work was delayed by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and landmines. The Taliban government announced last year that the project would switch to underground mining to better protect the historical relics.

The variant, a combination of two other strains, was first detected in Southeast Asia and has been growing globally. The World Health Organization has added XFG to its watchlist but assessed its public health risk as "low," advising that current vaccines should remain effective against it. While there is no evidence of more severe disease, some anecdotal reports have associated hoarseness as a potential symptom of the new variant.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was a preventable tragedy caused by multiple systemic failures. The comprehensive report heavily faults the late OceanGate CEO, Stockton Rush, for negligence, ignoring safety warnings, and deliberately avoiding industry regulations. Key contributing factors identified include the submersible's inadequate design, which used a cheaper carbon fiber hull, and a complete lack of proper certification and maintenance. The findings, which will likely lead to stronger industry oversight, mirror testimony from former employees who described a culture where safety was dismissed for profit.</p>
