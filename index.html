            <h2>Trump's Trade Goals Face Uncertainty Amid Tariff Adjustments</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 00:01:05 EDT</div>

            <p>Following a week of dramatic trade announcements, including a now-suspended tariff plan, it's unclear if Trump is closer to achieving his trade goals. While negotiations with countries like South Korea and Japan are underway, the on-again, off-again nature of tariffs creates instability for businesses. Trump aims to confront China, raise revenue through tariffs, and lower prices for US consumers, but success is uncertain. The situation presents risks, potentially alienating allies and impacting the US economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The European Union is finding itself in a position of increased leverage when dealing with China, primarily due to the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. This newfound leverage was exemplified when French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot delivered an ultimatum to Chinese counterparts regarding tariffs on cognac imports. China's temporary pause on duties on brandy is seen as a minor victory, highlighting Europe's strengthened hand in negotiations due to the US-China trade conflict.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's erratic tariff decisions have caused significant market volatility, leading to both substantial losses and gains for investors. Europe recognizes that Trump may back down under pressure, questioning why the EU has reduced retaliatory tariffs without a corresponding move from the US. There is a growing sentiment in Europe that the world is ready to bypass the US's unpredictability and that Europe needs to become a stable alternative. This chaos may strengthen the euro's case as a reserve currency, but Europe needs to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to ensure its economic stability.</p>

            <p>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a staunch supporter of Trump's trade policies, purchased stocks last week that had been heavily impacted by the administration's tariff threats. Greene bought shares in companies like Lululemon, Dell Computer, and Amazon after their stock prices had fallen significantly. While some of these investments have seen gains following a partial pause on tariffs, the move raises ethical questions about potential conflicts of interest for lawmakers.

            <p>The RSPB reports a decline in starling sightings in UK gardens, reaching the lowest numbers since their survey began in 1979. Starlings, known for their murmurations, are rapidly disappearing from UK gardens. The RSPB encourages small actions like avoiding pesticides and providing nest boxes to support starlings and other garden wildlife. The organization also emphasizes the need for government and business involvement in restoring the natural world.</p>

Despite a ceasefire, continued Israeli strikes have raised fears of renewed conflict. Schools are implementing evacuation plans and drills to prepare for potential bombings, as students, staff, and parents grapple with trauma.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been fired after a court ruling cleared the way for their dismissals. These employees, who perform important roles in climate research, were initially terminated in February, then rehired and placed on administrative leave, before being fired again. The firings are expected to hamper the agency's ability to provide essential climate and weather intelligence.
