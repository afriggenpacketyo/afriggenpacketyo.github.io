          <p>Five Iranian men were arrested in the UK on suspicion of planning a terrorist act, with the Israeli embassy in London believed to be the target. While police have not confirmed the embassy as the target, citing operational reasons, reports suggest the men were planning to attack the Kensington premises. The suspects, ranging in age from 24 to 46, were apprehended across different locations in the UK, including Swindon, London, Stockport, Rochdale, and Manchester. Authorities are maintaining vigilance and have asked the public to remain alert as the investigation continues to unfold.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested at Columbia University after occupying part of Butler Library, reigniting a protest movement from the previous spring. The protesters renamed the library and hung banners, leading to a standoff with security and eventually the NYPD being called in to secure the area after injuries were sustained by security officers. The incident occurred amidst ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Columbia over allegations of inadequate protection for Jewish students, which has resulted in the cutting of federal research funding. The university has condemned the disruption, stating that those involved will face disciplinary consequences as the situation threatens to further complicate negotiations for the restoration of federal funding.</p>

          <p>A federal judge expressed skepticism regarding the Trump administration's handling of Venezuelan migrants who were deported to a terrorism prison in El Salvador. The judge questioned the Justice Department lawyer about President Trump's statement regarding his ability to have the Salvadoran government send back a Salvadoran man who was wrongfully expelled, pressing for more information on the agreement between the U.S. and Salvadoran governments. Lawyers for the ACLU have argued that the men were sent to the prison without due process and that the use of the Alien Enemies Act was unlawful. The judge deferred ruling on the request to return the Venezuelan men, instead intending to order the government to disclose more information about its arrangements with El Salvador.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-led legislatures in Utah and Idaho banning "unofficial flags" on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted inventive workarounds by changing their official flags. Salt Lake City's mayor proposed and the city council approved three new city flags featuring the traditional sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag after the state restricted flag displays. These actions come amidst a broader trend of conservative legislatures rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, prompting reactions from city leaders aiming to affirm diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

          <p>For the second time in a little over a week, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea. In this latest incident, the jet went overboard when an arrestment failed during landing on the flight deck, but both aviators safely ejected and sustained only minor injuries. This follows an earlier incident where a Super Hornet fell overboard during towing in the hangar bay, with initial reports suggesting the carrier took evasive action against Houthi militants. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024, including an accidental shooting down of a U.S. fighter jet and a collision with a merchant vessel.</p>

          <p>A man, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, has been charged with felony stalking and felony vandalism after allegedly crashing his car into a gate outside Jennifer Aniston's home in Bel-Air.

Pakistan has condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed retaliation, leading India to conduct nationwide preparedness exercises, including air raid sirens and simulations for potential blackouts and mass evacuations. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Pakistan issued a security alert, and President Trump commented on the situation, expressing his desire to help both countries resolve the conflict.

Republican lawmakers threatened to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools, while Democrats accused Republicans of weaponizing antisemitism. The hearing comes amid increased scrutiny of universities' handling of pro-Palestinian protests and accusations of antisemitism, with the Trump administration opening investigations and cutting funding to schools it deems have not done enough.</p>

After a lower performance forecast, UnitedHealth's stock price plummeted, leading investors to seek damages and name current CEO Andrew Witty and CFO John Rex as co-defendants.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering deporting migrants to Libya, a country plagued by political turmoil and armed conflict, despite the State Department's Level 4 travel advisory warning against travel due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, are part of the administration's efforts to deter illegal immigration by forging agreements with countries to accept migrants from third countries. Libya has faced criticism for its treatment of migrants, with reports of brutal conditions and human rights violations in immigration detention centers.</p>

          <p>A technical outage at an air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, which handles traffic for Newark Liberty International Airport, caused significant delays and cancellations, leaving passengers frustrated. The outage, which involved the loss of radar feed and radio communication, prompted controllers to take mental health leave due to the stress, exacerbating existing staffing shortages. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has called for a complete overhaul of the air traffic control system, while the FAA has acknowledged the issues and is taking steps to improve reliability and increase staffing.</p>

          <p>Following a dog attack in New York City where a Chihuahua named Penny was severely injured by two pit bulls, state lawmakers are proposing "Penny's Law" to criminalize negligent dog handling. The current law considers dogs as property, limiting legal action to civil matters, but the proposed legislation would penalize owners who flee the scene of an attack and hold them accountable for their dog's behavior. The attack on Penny sparked national outrage, prompting calls for stricter laws to protect pets and hold owners responsible for their animals' actions.</p>

          <p>Binyamin Appelbaum argues that the current charitable tax deduction system in the United States disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the charities they support, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He suggests that the system distorts American philanthropy by incentivizing charities to cater to wealthy donors rather than addressing broader community needs. Appelbaum proposes replacing the charitable deduction with a tax incentive that provides equal subsidies to all donors, regardless of income, potentially through government matching of private donations or tax credits similar to those used in Canada.</p>

          <p>A newly opened Syrian Identification Centre is working to identify remains from mass graves, a grim task involving sorting through bones to determine height, sex, age, and potential torture, with DNA analysis limited by sanctions and cost. A former Syrian military driver, Abu Ali, testified to transporting hundreds of civilian corpses to mass grave sites during the Assad regime, providing details of the mangled and tortured bodies. The centre relies on funding from the International Committee of the Red Cross, as the new government prioritizes "transitional justice" after 13 years of civil war.</p>
