          <p>Canadians have voted in a snap federal election called by Prime Minister Mark Carney, leader of the Liberal Party, after succeeding Justin Trudeau. The election has centered around Canada's response to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and calls for annexation. Preliminary results are expected late Monday or early Tuesday, with key regions like Ontario and Quebec potentially influencing an early call. The outcome will determine whether Canada elects a minority or majority government, impacting the country's legislative path forward. Optimism remains reasonably high for a stable transition of power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration enforcement efforts to include unaccompanied minors, conducting 'welfare checks' that have sparked fears of deportation. This move is part of a broader crackdown, also targeting 'sanctuary cities' that limit cooperation with federal immigration laws. Critics have raised concerns about 'backdoor family separation' and the potential impact on vulnerable children. The administration's actions reflect a continued focus on stricter immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A research team predicts that by the 2060s, students in Japan may be unable to participate in extracurricular outdoor sports during the summer due to global warming. Heat stress projections indicate that intense sporting activity should be avoided during peak afternoon hours in most areas, excluding Hokkaido. The study highlights the potential impact of climate change on daily life and the need to adapt future activities.

Jamiel, a non-citizen, registered as a Conservative Party member before casting the ballot.

          <p>A California bill aimed at combating child sexual assault is being significantly weakened after its author reluctantly agreed to remove a felony charge for buyers of teen victims. Assemblywoman Maggy Krell removed the clause to ensure the bill would receive a hearing, but expressed strong disagreement with the amendment. The bill still criminalizes loitering to buy teenagers for sex and establishes a fund for victims.

          <p>Communities along the Mississippi River south of New Orleans are facing a severe threat from saltwater intrusion, impacting drinking water, seafood industries, and infrastructure. The intrusion has compromised the freshwater supply for thousands, corroded water pipes, and raised concerns about lead contamination. The cost to fix broken pipes and build stronger infrastructure is estimated at $200 million. Researchers blame drought, sea level rise, and dredging for the increased frequency of saltwater intrusion, prompting calls for urgent action and long-term solutions.</p>
