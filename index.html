The plant, owned by Liberty Steel, faces potential liquidation due to substantial unpaid debts following the collapse of its main lender. A High Court judge is deliberating the company's fate, weighing a winding-up order sought by creditors against a potential administration and sale proposed by owner Sanjeev Gupta. The government's intervention reflects the strategic importance of the plant, which houses the UK's only electric arc furnaces.</p>

          <p>Polish authorities have reported that the debris of a Russian-made drone crashed in a field in eastern Poland, an incident they are calling a deliberate provocation. Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz stated that the drone's incursion into Polish airspace occurred at a crucial moment during peace discussions for Ukraine. Initial findings suggest the drone was an unarmed Russian version of the Iranian-designed Shahed model, equipped with a self-destruct warhead. Poland has condemned the violation of its airspace and plans to issue a formal protest.</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Jay Cutler has publicly contested claims made by his ex-wife, Kristin Cavallari, that she received no money from their divorce. On his podcast, Cutler labeled her assertions as "completely false" and "borderline slander," explaining that Tennessee state law would not permit such an outcome in their divorce settlement. Cavallari had stated on her own podcast that she was the sole owner and funder of her company, Uncommon James, and received no financial support from Cutler. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions between the former couple, who finalized their divorce in 2022.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 30 major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has urged the UK government to develop a national stablecoin strategy to avoid falling behind the United States. In an open letter to the Finance Minister, they argued that the UK should embrace stablecoins as financial infrastructure rather than a risk to be contained. The group criticized the current regulatory definition of stablecoins and highlighted that a proactive strategy could strengthen the UK's position as a global financial hub. The market for pound-pegged stablecoins remains minimal compared to their US dollar-backed counterparts.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a temporary ruling blocking a Texas law that would have required public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom. Judge Fred Biery sided with plaintiffs who argued the mandate violates the First Amendment's separation of church and state, stating the displays would likely pressure students into religious observance. The lawsuit was filed by a group of families and faith leaders, who hailed the decision as a victory for religious freedom and parents' rights. This marks the third time a state-level Ten Commandments law has been blocked by a court.</p>

The call for Cook's resignation is seen as part of Trump's broader pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.

          <p>Actress Aubrey Plaza has spoken publicly for the first time about the death of her husband, writer and director Jeff Baena, who died by suicide in January. In a conversation on Amy Poehler's podcast, Plaza described her grief as a "daily struggle" and compared the feeling to a constant, overwhelming ocean of awfulness. She shared that while she is functioning, some days are more difficult than others, but expressed happiness in the present moment while speaking with her former co-star. Baena and Plaza were a couple for a decade before marrying in 2021.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old man from Buckinghamshire, Jason King, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a police officer with a crossbow and stabbing a neighbor's partner. The incident occurred in May 2024 after police were called to a neighbor dispute, during which King fired repeatedly at officers from his window before chasing them. PC Curtis Foster was hit in the leg by a crossbow bolt but has since made a full recovery. The judge deemed King a "significant" risk, noting his actions were like he was "trying to hunt down the officer."</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the entire U.S.-Mexico border wall will be painted black, a strategy she credited to President Trump. The rationale is that the black paint will absorb heat, making the wall hotter and more difficult for migrants to climb in high temperatures. This initiative is part of the administration's broader immigration crackdown, which has seen border crossings plummet in recent months. The administration also plans to install additional "waterborne infrastructure" along the Rio Grande to further deter illegal crossings.</p>

          <p>Ousted Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley has filed a legal claim against the city, alleging Mayor Karen Bass defamed her and orchestrated a misinformation campaign to shift blame for the city's handling of the catastrophic Palisades Fire. Crowley claims Bass scapegoated her to protect her own political image, particularly amid criticism of the mayor's absence during the fire. The claim asserts that Crowley had previously warned about underfunding and staffing shortages that compromised the department's readiness, and that her dismissal was retaliatory after she spoke publicly about these budget cuts.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's finance chief, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, but continues to face immense pressure from the high demand for AI computing power. Friar described the need for GPUs and compute as "voracious," stating the company is "constantly under compute," which necessitates aggressive spending on data centers and infrastructure projects like Stargate. This rapid growth, fueled by the success of ChatGPT, has the company on track to potentially triple its annual revenue to $12.7 billion, highlighting the massive operational costs associated with leading-edge AI development.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a "superfood" supplement designed to protect honeybees from threats like climate change and nutrient deficiencies. The new food contains all the essential nutrients bees need to survive, including specific lipids called sterols that were previously difficult to manufacture. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that reached adulthood. This breakthrough could provide a crucial tool for beekeepers to support honeybee populations, which are vital for pollinating a majority of global food crops.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice alleges in a new court filing that executives from voting machine company Smartmatic funneled money from a Los Angeles County contract into slush funds.

While prosecutors claim money from the 2018 LA contract was transferred into these accounts, it is not specified if any bribes were paid using those specific funds. The allegations emerge amid a defamation lawsuit Smartmatic filed against Fox News, which is using the corruption charges to defend its reporting.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the practice of daily reading for pleasure among U.S. adults has declined by more than 40% over the last 20 years. Researchers from the University of Florida and University College London analyzed data from 2003 to 2023 and found a steady drop, with the percentage of daily readers falling from 28% to 16%. The decline is attributed to digital distractions, a general decrease in leisure time, and uneven access to books. Interestingly, those who do read for pleasure are doing so for longer periods than they were two decades ago.</p>
