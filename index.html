          <p>The Indiana Fever have parted ways with two-time WNBA champion DeWanna Bonner, fueled by speculation of strained relations. Bonner's statement hinted at a misalignment of expectations after she was benched early in the season.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for EV chargers to 14 states that sued to challenge the ongoing freeze. The funds, allocated by Congress, are intended to install high-speed chargers along highway corridors. The Department of Transportation had paused the funds, citing the need for new guidance. The judge's ruling is a preliminary injunction, and the administration has been granted a seven-day pause to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>To secure Meta's $10 billion data center, Louisiana offered significant incentives, including a 20-year sales tax exemption. The data center, set to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, is expected to transform Louisiana's economy, though it will only create 500 permanent jobs. The state purchased the 2,250-acre site in Richland Parish in 2006, and Entergy plans to build three gas-fired power plants to meet the data center's energy needs. The project highlights the competition among states to attract data centers, despite their high resource consumption and low employment numbers.</p>

          <h2>Israeli Analysis Supports Claims That US Strikes Crippled Iran's Nuclear Program</h2>

          <p>According to a senior Israeli official, preliminary analysis suggests that US strikes inflicted widespread destruction on Iran's main nuclear facilities. The official stated that Tehran has been actively trying to conceal the damage from the attacks. The Israeli assessment contrasts with an initial US Defense Intelligence Agency report that cast doubt on the effectiveness of the strikes. The US attack followed nine days of an Israeli military campaign that targeted Iran's air defenses and missile stockpiles.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detained 1,618 immigrants in Southern California between June 6 and June 22, leading to protests and confrontations with immigration officers. As immigration arrests occurred, demonstrators protested the federal governmentâ€™s actions and bystanders videotaped their actions. The DHS reported that 787 people were arrested for assault, obstruction, and unlawful assembly during the period. Data from the initial days of the operation indicated that most of those arrested had no prior criminal convictions.</p>
