        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is imposing new sanctions on Sudan in response to the Sudanese Armed Forces' alleged use of chemical weapons against the Rapid Support Forces in 2024. The sanctions, set to begin in June, will restrict US exports to Sudan and block access to US government lines of credit. These economic and humanitarian sector-focused sanctions are expected to disproportionately affect civilians already suffering from the ongoing conflict, with millions displaced and facing famine. Experts doubt the sanctions will halt the war, as both factions have likely adapted to such measures, and a new Sudanese Prime Minister has been appointed to form a transitional government.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from implementing large-scale job cuts and agency reorganizations under its Department of Government Efficiency initiative. The judge stated that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates and that the President cannot initiate such reorganizations without Congressional partnership. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, arguing that Presidents have the authority to set policy priorities for the executive branch. The judge's order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to deploy approximately 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement in arresting unauthorized immigrants within the United States. This initiative, expected to commence next week, involves Border Patrol agents and officers from the Office of Field Operations and Air and Marine Operations. These CBP agents will support ICE's enforcement operations across its 25 field offices, marking a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to bolster deportation operations amid historically low illegal border crossings. The plan highlights the administration's focus on interior enforcement, even as Congress debates funding for additional immigration agents and detention beds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has called on Apple to begin manufacturing iPhones in the United States or face tariffs of at least 25% on those made abroad. This demand continues a decade-long effort to move Apple's supply chain, but the company has largely shifted production to other Asian countries like India and Vietnam. Experts argue that making iPhones in the US would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling prices due to higher labor costs and automation needs. Apple's previous experience assembling Mac desktops in the US faced challenges, and the company may be focusing on future augmented reality products rather than long-term iPhone production.</p>

          <p>An etiquette expert suggests the best approach to splitting restaurant bills with friends is to communicate in advance to avoid awkward moments or potential conflicts. The most sophisticated way to handle this is to inform the server directly about separate checks at the beginning of the meal. If splitting the bill evenly, be mindful of others' consumption, especially regarding alcohol, and speak up if you don't want to pay for expensive items you didn't consume. Consider paying separately if you have children or know someone who tends to overspend.</p>

          <p>The House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans through tax cuts for business owners, investors, and homeowners. Conversely, low-income households would likely see their incomes fall due to reductions in social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bottom 10% of households would experience a 2% income drop in 2027, while the top 10% would see a 4% increase. Economists suggest the bill exacerbates the regressive nature of recent tariff policies, compounding the financial strain on lower- and working-class families.</p>

          <p>Ruth Beaglehole, a Los Angeles-based parent educator and child rights activist, passed away at 81, leaving behind a legacy of nonviolent parenting. For over 50 years, she advocated for parenting with empathy and kindness, countering "childism" by teaching generations of parents to avoid spanking, threats, and manipulation. She founded institutions like the Echo Park Silverlake Peopleâ€™s Child Care Center and the Center for Nonviolent Education and Parenting. Her teachings have rippled across L.A. and the world, helping families break cycles of violence and oppression toward children, emphasizing that parenting is about understanding children as human beings.</p>

The court's view aligns with the unitary executive theory, which posits that the president should have control over officials who exercise executive power, but the implications for the Federal Reserve remain uncertain.</p>

Grigorovich's choreography departed from the drambalet style, focusing on dance steps and male dancers, and his ballets were popular both in Russia and abroad.

Contrast-enhanced mammography is not yet widely used for screening in the United States, but experts suggest it should become standard care for women with dense breasts at high risk of developing breast cancer.
