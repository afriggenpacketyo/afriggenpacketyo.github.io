          <p>A security firm run by Blackwater founder Erik Prince is set to deploy nearly 200 international personnel to Haiti to combat soaring gang violence. The one-year deal with Vectus Global aims to help the Haitian government reclaim territory from powerful gangs that control large parts of the country. The deployment will support Haiti's national police and a U.N.-backed Kenyan mission, but has raised concerns from experts about the lack of a coherent strategy and potential fragmentation of authority.</p>

          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key data for retail sales and industrial output fell short of expectations, indicating weakening domestic demand. Retail sales grew 3.7%, missing the 4.6% forecast, while industrial output rose 5.7%, its slowest pace since last November. The slowdown is attributed to a complex external environment, extreme weather, and government efforts to curb excess industrial capacity, raising concerns about achieving the annual growth target of 5%.

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after a shocking discovery of 177 World War II-era practice bombs buried just beneath the surface. The first device was found by a worker installing new play equipment, leading to a specialized ordnance disposal team being called in. The bombs, which were not live but carried a charge, were found carefully stacked, likely left from when the site was a military ordnance depot during the war, remaining undetected for decades.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.

The meeting at the strategic Arctic military base follows unsuccessful previous negotiation rounds and aims to be a "listening exercise," though President Trump hopes to achieve a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants looms, threatening to disrupt travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The airline initiated a gradual suspension of operations after the union issued a 72-hour strike notice, with a full grounding expected by Saturday if no deal is reached. Key issues in the contract dispute include wages and unpaid labor, with the airline and the union remaining far apart in negotiations.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that state Democrats will advance a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts, a direct response to a Republican effort in Texas to gerrymander maps for partisan advantage. The proposal would override California's independent redistricting commission and would only take effect if a Republican-led state implements a mid-cycle partisan redistricting plan. Newsom framed the move as a necessary defensive measure to "meet fire with fire" and protect democracy from partisan manipulation.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: 'And Just Like That' Finale Provides a Fittingly Independent Ending for Carrie Bradshaw</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with its protagonist, Carrie Bradshaw, single once again, an ending that a review in the article describes as more true to the character than a traditional fairytale romance. After the death of her husband and a series of life's indignities, the show returns to the original "Sex and the City" theme that friendships are one's true soulmates. The article argues that while the spin-off was often clumsy, it ultimately gave Carrie a more fitting and revolutionary ending by embracing a life fulfilled by herself and her friends.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a breakthrough that could effectively turn any warship into an aircraft carrier. The runway-independent aircraft can launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, before transitioning to fast, long-range flight. The project's team claims the drone is far superior in speed to other current VTOL models, representing a significant potential advancement in China's naval power projection.</p>
