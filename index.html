          <p>Negotiations are set to resume between Birmingham City Council and the Unite union to resolve the ongoing bin workers' strike, now in its seventh week, which has led to significant waste accumulation and public health concerns. The government has urged Unite to accept the council's offer, while residents report some improvements in waste collection. The strike, involving hundreds of bin workers, stems from a dispute over pay and jobs, with recycling and garden waste collections suspended since the beginning of the year. The council has stated that they are keen to continue discussions to resolve the dispute.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London have been downgraded, with key US officials no longer participating, amidst speculation about potential concessions. Ukrainian President Zelensky has firmly rejected recognizing occupied Crimea as Russian territory, despite reports suggesting it could be a topic of discussion. Meanwhile, Russia unilaterally called a temporary ceasefire for the Easter weekend, but British military intelligence found no evidence of a reduction in attacks. The conflict, ongoing since 2014, has resulted in significant casualties and displacement.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced a notable increase after activist investor Elliott revealed a stake exceeding 5% in the oil major. Elliott's involvement is anticipated to exert pressure on BP to reassess its green strategy and prioritize its core oil and gas operations. This development follows BP's recent announcement of plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, coinciding with a decline in crude prices due to trade tensions between the US and China. The company has been lagging behind its rivals and has faced pressure from investors.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk plans to significantly reduce his role in the US government's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) following a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and sales. This decision comes after Tesla reported a 20% decrease in car sales and a 70% drop in profits, attributing some of the challenges to "changing political sentiment" and trade policies. Musk's political involvement, including significant contributions to Trump's re-election campaign, has faced criticism and boycotts of Tesla. He will now spend only one to two days per week on the Doge.</p>

          <p>Inspired by his father's heart failure, Daniel Timms developed a durable total artificial heart, made from titanium, that could potentially replace the need for organ transplants. A patient in Sydney became the first to be discharged from the hospital with the device, living with it for over 100 days before receiving a donor heart. The device, created by Timms' company BiVACOR, aims to provide a permanent solution for heart failure patients, eliminating the need for long waiting lists and donor hearts. Timms envisions a future where patients receive this device and live with it for the rest of their lives.</p>

          <h2>US Births Increase Slightly in 2024, Driven by Hispanic and Asian Women</h2>

          <p>The number of births in the US increased by 1% in 2024, according to CDC data, but one demographer cautioned against drawing conclusions about a trend due to challenges in economic uncertainty, housing and childcare costs. The increase appears to be driven by Hispanic and Asian women, while births declined for Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women. The report did not address the impact of abortion bans on birth rates or the effect of potential policies by the Trump administration to encourage married heterosexual couples to have babies.</p>

          <p>International students in the US, stripped of their legal status, are achieving victories in court. Over a thousand international students have faced similar disruptions, with their academic careers and lives thrown into doubt. Judges have issued orders to restore students' legal status at least temporarily, while some are speculating the government is trying to encourage these students to self-deport. Some targeted students have faced minor infractions, or it's unclear altogether why they were targeted.</p>
