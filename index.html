          <p>A 17-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the killing of Sunshine Stewart, a 48-year-old paddleboarder found dead in Maine earlier this month. Stewart's body was discovered under "unusual circumstances" in Crawford Pond, and an autopsy confirmed her death was a homicide caused by strangulation and blunt force trauma. While police have not released details on the suspect's identity, charges, or a potential motive, the arrest has brought a significant sense of relief to Union residents. Many locals had been concerned by rumors of a serial killer, and they now hope for justice in this tragic case, remembering Stewart as "a great, great person all-around."</p>

          <p>A mother and her nine-year-old son, lost in a remote California forest en route to a Boy Scouts camp, were successfully rescued after a search crew located their "HELP" notes. The pair became stranded when their GPS directed them onto old logging roads, leading to a loss of signal and their car getting stuck approximately 10 miles from the nearest paved road. Reported missing after not arriving at camp, a volunteer search-and-rescue team utilized a location-sharing app and camper sightings to find their notes. Authorities highly commended their preparedness, including packing food and water, staying with their vehicle, and the boy using his Scout whistle, which ultimately facilitated their safe discovery.</p>

          <h2>Marathon World Record Holder Provisionally Suspended Over Doping Allegations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ruth Chepngetich, the 30-year-old Kenyan marathon world record holder, has been provisionally suspended on suspicion of doping by World Athletics' independent Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). She tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic that can mask other illicit substances, in March, after smashing the women's marathon world record last October. Chepngetich voluntarily accepted the suspension in April, citing mental and physical unreadiness for a London Marathon withdrawal, though a provisional suspension was not initially mandatory. The AIU emphasized her right to a disciplinary tribunal hearing, as this incident marks another high-profile doping case involving a Kenyan runner, raising concerns within the sport.</p>

This comes after a resurgence of inflation and increasing tariff costs, which Warren attributes partly to President Trump's global trade war. The bill requires companies over $100 million in revenue to report price changes exceeding average past rates, providing details on costs and margins, and allocates $1 billion to the FTC for enforcement.

Hankison was found guilty in November 2024 for shooting into Taylor’s bedroom during a narcotics raid on the wrong home in March 2020, though his shots did not hit anyone. Despite facing a maximum of life in prison, the DOJ argued that a prison sentence is unnecessary given he did not injure anyone and has suffered psychological stress.

Despite his assertions, many documents related to Epstein, including those mentioning prominent figures, have been public for years, and a Justice Department review confirmed Epstein's suicide in 2019 during his presidency.

Though corn syrup involves more processing and some studies suggest a link to higher inflammation, both sweeteners have a similarly high glycemic index and provide "empty calories."

This spectacular celestial event occurs as Earth passes through debris from Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, causing tiny particles to vaporize and create visible streaks of light in the atmosphere. Optimal viewing conditions require a dark, clear sky away from light pollution, with the best time typically between midnight and an hour before sunrise in the northern hemisphere. Viewers are advised to check local weather forecasts for clear skies and allow their eyes time to adjust to the low light for the best chance to spot the meteors.</p>

This marks the second major crackdown since Starmer took office, reigniting debate over his leadership and party discipline. One suspended MP, Rachel Maskell, stated she would not be silenced and would continue to advocate for her constituents, particularly on disabled people reforms, as an independent, despite her intention to support the Labour government.

          <p>The Trump administration, through Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, has formally terminated $4 billion in federal funding for the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA). The Federal Railroad Administration cited the CHSRA's "inability to complete" its goals and "mismanagement and incompetence" in its termination letter. President Trump praised the action, calling the project a "boondoggle" that was "Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED," and criticized Governor Newsom. Governor Newsom, however, vowed to fight this "illegal action," as the project, initially aiming to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, had been scaled back to a shorter segment and faced significant cost overruns and persistent delays, highlighting a major federal-state dispute.</p>

          <p>More than half of Britain's busiest airports have increased their "kiss-and-fly" fees for passenger drop-offs near terminals, according to research by the RAC motoring group. Eleven out of 20 UK airports raised prices since last July, with Gatwick, Bristol, Leeds Bradford, and Southampton joining Stansted in charging the top rate of £7 for a matter of minutes. In stark contrast, nine of the ten busiest EU airports have no such drop-off fees. Airports UK defended the charges, stating they help manage congestion, reduce emissions, and fund sustainable transport initiatives, while also noting free drop-off options further from terminals are available.

The National Association of Home Builders' confidence index saw only a slight improvement to 33, remaining in negative territory for 15 straight months. While a recent budget act provided some tax relief, elevated mortgage rates continue to significantly hinder affordability for consumers. Consequently, 38% of builders reported cutting prices in July, with an average reduction of 5%, indicating persistent challenges in the housing sector and a likely decline in single-family housing starts for 2025.

It asserts the state's duty to protect minors from "irreversible consequences" due to their perceived lack of maturity and explicitly prohibits public funding for such care.
