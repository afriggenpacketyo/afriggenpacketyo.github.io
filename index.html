          <p>Investing in gold is not about following a strict schedule but rather viewing it as a crucial portfolio component. Experts suggest gold should comprise no more than 10% of an investment portfolio, varying based on the investor's profile. It's generally advisable to invest sooner rather than later, given gold's tendency to increase in value over time, despite minor fluctuations. For existing investors, re-evaluating the timeline for rebuilding gold investments may be necessary, especially after selling for profit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court justices questioned Donald Trump's effort to limit birthright citizenship through an executive order, which contradicts the 14th Amendment. The arguments focused on whether lower court judges should have the power to block presidential orders nationwide, rather than the constitutionality of the policy itself. Justice Sotomayor noted the order violates Supreme Court precedents, while the administration argued that nationwide injunctions unfairly tie the president's hands. Critics warn that limiting judges' power would force individuals to file numerous lawsuits to protect their rights, creating a patchwork system of citizenship.</p>

The boy's grandmother found live ammunition and a homemade explosive in his room, leading to the discovery of his plans. Pardo was charged with aiding in the commission of terrorism and later released on bail. This case follows others where parents have been held accountable for their children's violent acts, highlighting the increasing scrutiny on parental responsibility in school shootings.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments over President Trump's request to roll back injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship. The court is expected to decide whether Trump can limit U.S. citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents and address the legality of judges blocking presidential policies nationwide. The 14th Amendment has been interpreted to apply to anyone born in the U.S., regardless of their parents' citizenship status. Justices questioned the implications of eliminating nationwide injunctions and the potential for prolonged enforcement of unlawful policies.</p>

          <p>Allen Gould was arrested for allegedly murdering his wife, Anna Maciejewska, who vanished in 2017, with prosecutors alleging he faked a birthday text to her father. Evidence suggests Maciejewska stopped her normal routine on March 29, with the last sighting on March 28. The text message, sent on March 30, had grammatical errors and was traced back to Google Translate. Maciejewska's iPhone and iPad were found at home in a startup/update status, and divorce paperwork was also discovered. Gould is being held without bail on charges including first-degree murder and tampering with evidence.</p>
