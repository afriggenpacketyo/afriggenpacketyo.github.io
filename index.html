The explosion, which caused no injuries, is being investigated by anti-mafia authorities and occurred on the eighth anniversary of the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Ranucci, who has been under police protection for his work on organized crime, stated the attack would not deter his program's investigations and would produce the opposite of the intended effect.</p>

          <p>The 'No Kings' movement is organizing nationwide protests to oppose what it describes as the Trump administration's abuses of power, corruption, and authoritarian actions. The demonstrations, backed by various left-wing groups, will focus on policies such as immigration enforcement, the deployment of federal agents in cities, and the administration's perceived disregard for democratic norms. Originating as a response to President Trump's military parade, the movement aims to mobilize millions to assert that America should not be governed by a monarch-like figure.</p>

          <p>A significant international agreement aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the global shipping industry has been abandoned following successful opposition from the United States and Saudi Arabia. The deal, which would have established the world's first internationally mandated emissions targets for an entire industry, failed after the Trump administration reportedly threatened other nations with tariffs if they supported the plan. The collapse of the talks in London represents a major setback for global climate efforts and drew a plea from the International Maritime Organisation's head to prevent such pressure tactics in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly blocking federal funding for two critical New York infrastructure projects, the Gateway rail tunnel and the Second Avenue Subway extension, by imposing a burdensome new regulatory review process. Critics argue this move is a form of political pressure on New York's Democratic leaders and contradicts Trump's campaign promises to reduce bureaucracy. This action effectively positions the administration as an obstacle to major development, leveraging red tape to stall projects that were previously in compliance with federal guidelines.</p>

          <p>Two-time undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk has announced he plans to continue his boxing career for two more years, intending to fight until he is 41. This reverses previous hints that the 38-year-old Ukrainian was considering retirement after one more bout. Usyk confirmed he is back in training after a back injury and aims to return to the ring in 2026, though he dismissed a potential fight with young British heavyweight Moses Itauma. Negotiations for his next opponent are currently ongoing.</p>

          <p>A French court has convicted Cédric Jubillar of murdering his wife, Delphine, and sentenced him to 30 years in prison in a case that has captivated the nation. The verdict was reached despite the fact that Delphine's body has never been located since her disappearance in December 2020. Prosecutors successfully argued that a wealth of circumstantial evidence, including a heated argument over her affair and her broken glasses found at their home, pointed to his guilt, overcoming the defense's argument that no crime could be proven without a body.</p>

          <h2>African Union's Effectiveness Questioned Following Military Coup in Madagascar</h2>

          <p>The African Union (AU) has suspended Madagascar following a military coup, adding it to a growing list of member states sanctioned for unconstitutional changes of government. However, analysts are questioning the effectiveness of such suspensions, arguing they are a reactive measure with limited power to deter or reverse coups on the continent. Critics suggest the AU needs more proactive, preventative strategies, but the bloc's actions are often constrained by its principle of respecting the national sovereignty of its member states.</p>

          <p>Relatives of two fishermen from a Trinidadian village, believed killed in a recent U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, are demanding justice and accusing the U.S. of extrajudicial killings. The Trump administration has described the six individuals killed as "narcoterrorists," but family members argue the men were denied due process and were simply "poor people" caught in a broader geopolitical conflict. The incident has stoked fear among local fishing communities and criticism of the Trinidad and Tobago government's cooperation with the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval rating on the economy has fallen to its lowest point during his presidency, according to a new CNBC survey. The poll shows 55% of Americans disapprove of his economic handling, with concerns over inflation, jobs, and the government shutdown contributing to the negative sentiment. The survey indicates that independents, a key voter demographic, are leaning substantially negative on the president's economic policies, and a majority of the public blames the president and congressional Republicans for the shutdown's potential fallout.

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 stock index fell after two U.S. regional banks warned of losses from bad or fraudulent loans, sparking a sell-off in banking shares across Europe. Major UK banks like Barclays and Standard Chartered saw their share prices drop over 5% as investor nervousness about the health of the U.S. banking sector spread. The market turbulence reflects broader anxiety following recent high-profile failures in the private credit market and fears of poor risk management and lax lending standards.

          <p>Federal employee unions claim the Trump administration is preparing to lay off thousands of workers at the Department of the Interior, potentially violating a court order that temporarily blocks such firings during the government shutdown. The unions have sued to halt what they term "politically driven" reductions in force.

          <p>Historians have identified the Nazi gunman in one of the most infamous photographs of the Holocaust, known as "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa." Through new research and AI-based facial recognition, the perpetrator is believed with 99% certainty to be Jakobus Onnen, a member of the Nazi SS Einsatzgruppe C. The breakthrough came after a higher-quality print of the photo surfaced, which also corrected the location of the 1941 mass murder from Vinnytsia to Berdychiv, Ukraine, providing a more accurate historical record of the atrocity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lost its attempt to block a judicial review of its decision to ban the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. The Court of Appeal ruled that the group's co-founder can proceed with a High Court challenge next month, rejecting the government's argument that a separate, slower appeal process must be used first. This significant ruling allows for a more immediate legal examination of the proscription, which has led to over 2,100 arrests since it came into effect.</p>

While Amorim appreciated the public expression of long-term support amid a period of poor results, he emphasized that in football, job security is never guaranteed and is determined by the next game's outcome. The manager stated that he does not want the team to feel they have ample time, as the pressure to perform and prove themselves must be constant at a major club.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of conducting lethal military strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean is facing intense scrutiny over its legality and strategic effectiveness. Critics, including former government lawyers, argue the strikes constitute extrajudicial killings without due process, as the vessels posed no immediate threat and could have been interdicted to gather intelligence. The policy is seen by some as a subversion of constitutional war powers and a dangerous precedent that could harm innocent people and undermine the rule of law.</p>
