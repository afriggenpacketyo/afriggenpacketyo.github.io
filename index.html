Before entering politics, Casello served as a firefighter for three decades in Massachusetts and later became a Boynton Beach city commissioner. His colleagues remembered him for his humility, kindness, and sense of humor.

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, known as Operation Valkyrie, is being commemorated. Led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg, the plot involved a bomb planted at Hitler's Wolf's Lair headquarters, but the dictator survived with minor injuries. The coup ultimately failed, leading to the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. The article reflects on the historical significance of the event and the evolving perception of the conspirators, who were initially seen as traitors but are now largely honored as resistance heroes.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is nearing a potential move to Barcelona after an agreement in principle was reached for an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford has reportedly favored a move to the Spanish club since falling out of favor with head coach Ruben Amorim. The transfer would be financially beneficial for Manchester United, as it would free up his significant wages, allowing the club to pursue other signings. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for the English player.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has reportedly revoked the visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges as part of a campaign to support former president Jair Bolsonaro. This action, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets judges involved in the prosecution of Bolsonaro over his alleged coup attempt. The move follows other pressure tactics, including the threat of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which has sparked nationalist anger in Brazil. President Lula has condemned the visa revocations as unacceptable interference in Brazil's judicial sovereignty and an affront to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The second-quarter earnings season is off to a generally positive start, helping to support the stock market despite ongoing economic concerns like inflation and potential tariffs. While some individual company reports have been mixed, the overall trend suggests corporations are navigating the complex environment effectively. The article notes that while inflation is taming, shelter costs remain high, complicating the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. For now, the combination of strong corporate performance and a stable labor market is keeping market sentiment cautiously optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) in an April federal filing. This designation is intended to help businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals gain preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made shortly before a funding round valued the company, led by the world's wealthiest person, at $9 billion. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box on the form was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, and that the company never received any benefit from the status.</p>

          <p>An analysis details the potential legal, economic, and market chaos that could ensue if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While legal experts believe Trump lacks the authority to do so without "cause," such a move would likely trigger a protracted court battle and create massive uncertainty. The article explores the political motivations, suggesting Trump may be setting Powell up as a scapegoat for any economic downturn. Firing the chair could also backfire by undermining the Fed's credibility, potentially leading to higher inflation and interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway claims that "follow your passion" is poor career advice often given by those who are already wealthy. He argues that success comes from finding the intersection of what you are good at and what is commercially valuable, rather than blindly pursuing a passion. Galloway, a self-made millionaire, emphasizes that enduring rejection and pivoting based on skills and opportunities were key to his own success. The article suggests that a more practical approach is to identify personal strengths and apply them to fields that offer financial stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tanning is experiencing a cultural comeback, moving beyond a simple aesthetic choice to become an ideological statement for some. The trend is visible in pop culture and among political figures, with some alternative-health influencers and members of the MAHA movement promoting sun exposure and questioning the safety of sunscreen. This new "sun worship" aligns with a broader skepticism of mainstream health institutions, framing a return to "natural" behaviors like sunbathing as a way to reclaim health. Dermatologists express concern, as the known risks of skin cancer are being ignored in favor of these new beliefs.</p>
