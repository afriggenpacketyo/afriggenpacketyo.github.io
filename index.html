          <p>A mass shooting occurred outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in Chicago's River North, resulting in four deaths and fourteen injuries. Police report that occupants of a dark SUV fired into a crowd leaving an album release party for a local rapper. The victims ranged in age from 21 to 32, with several remaining in critical condition. Authorities have since issued a summary closure for the nightclub as the investigation into the shooting, which is believed to involve three shooters, continues with no arrests yet made.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has announced it will take up cases from West Virginia and Idaho concerning state laws that prohibit transgender students from participating in girls' and women's sports. Lower courts had previously ruled that these bans violated either the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause or Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. This decision follows a recent ruling where the court upheld state bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors. The cases will be argued in the fall, with a final decision expected in 2026.</p>

          <p>NASA has identified a new comet, named 3I/ATLAS, which originated from outside our solar system, marking only the third such interstellar visitor ever detected. The object was spotted by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles from Earth, posing no threat. This discovery offers a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from another star system. Astronomers anticipate finding many more interstellar objects with the upcoming Vera C.

          <p>A legal expert has detailed potential strategies for the Trump administration to pursue the deportation of anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident. Khalil was arrested for his role in campus protests and an immigration judge initially ruled for his removal, but he was later released from detention by a federal judge. The expert argues the administration should appeal the release, citing national security concerns and alleged omissions on Khalil's green card application. The ACLU has defended Khalil, framing the case as a First Amendment issue concerning free speech and political dissent.</p>

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a marathon speech on the House floor, speaking for over eight hours to delay the final vote on President Trump's major tax and spending package. Jeffries vehemently criticized the bill, labeling it an "immoral document" and an "assault on the healthcare of the American people." He argued that the legislation's significant cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP would harm children, seniors, and people with disabilities. The speech utilized the "magic minute" procedure, which grants leadership unlimited speaking time after formal debate has ended.</p>

While he avoided a potential life sentence, he still faces up to 10 years in prison for each conviction and will remain jailed until his sentencing. The verdict does not resolve his legal troubles, as he still faces numerous civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault and other misconduct.

          <p>The United States has recorded over 1,200 measles cases this year, the highest number since a major wave in 2019, with infections confirmed in at least 37 states. The largest outbreak is centered in West Texas, which accounts for over 750 cases and has resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten MMR vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold needed for community immunity. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly encouraged vaccination in response to the spreading outbreak.</p>

          <p>Following the recent conflict involving Iran and Israel, the Trump administration is pushing to expand the Abraham Accords to include Syria and Lebanon, though experts express significant skepticism. While a deal with Syria's new leadership is being explored, major obstacles remain, such as Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. A peace agreement with Lebanon is considered even less likely due to the ongoing conflict with Hezbollah and unresolved territorial disputes. Analysts suggest the U.S. push is driven more by a desire for a diplomatic win than a realistic strategy for regional stability.</p>

          <p>Uncontrolled wildfires on the Greek island of Crete have forced the evacuation of thousands of people, including approximately 5,000 tourists. The blaze, which began near Ierapetra on the island's southern coast, has been fueled by gale-force winds, hampering firefighting efforts. Authorities have ordered residents from four villages to evacuate, and many tourists have been relocated to shelters and other hotels. Over 230 firefighters, supported by water-dropping helicopters, are battling the flames, with the risk of wildfires remaining very high across the region due to hot, dry conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Republican-led spending bill warns that its repeal of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act could be a major economic misstep. With U.S. electricity demand surging due to AI data centers and electric vehicles, the bill would eliminate key incentives for wind and solar projects, which currently constitute the vast majority of new power capacity. This move could raise energy costs for consumers, making the grid less reliable and hindering U.S. competitiveness against China in clean energy. Critics argue the policy is driven by partisan opposition to renewables rather than sound economic or energy strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities has revealed a significant disconnect between him and self-proclaimed MAGA thought leaders like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon. While these figures vehemently opposed the strike, warning it would betray Trump's base, polls show overwhelming support for the action among Republican voters. This article argues that there is no coherent 'Trumpism' ideology beyond Trump's own impulses, and commentators who claim to be its architects are merely opportunists. Their failure to predict or influence the base's reaction demonstrates they are not true representatives of the movement.</p>

          <p>As families plan for the 2025-26 academic year, they face a choice between federal and private student loans, each with distinct interest rates. For the upcoming year, new federal undergraduate loans will have a fixed rate of 6.39%, while private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit. While private loans can offer substantial savings for those who qualify, they lack the robust protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs.

          <p>Top FDA officials appointed by the Trump administration under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overruled the agency's career scientists to restrict approvals for COVID-19 vaccines from Novavax and Moderna. Newly released records, including a memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad, show that political leadership narrowed the vaccines' use to seniors and at-risk individuals, citing a shifting benefit-risk calculation. Career staff had initially recommended broader approval for all individuals over age 12. This direct intervention by political appointees in traditional approval decisions is described as virtually unprecedented and has drawn criticism for potentially eroding the agency's scientific credibility.</p>

          <p>Universal has submitted planning documents for its proposed UK theme park in Bedford, revealing ambitions to build some of Europe's tallest rides. The plans suggest structures could reach up to 377 feet (115m), surpassing the current tallest ride in Europe, to create a competitive and visually interesting skyline. The resort, aiming for an opening by 2031, expects to attract 8.5 million visitors annually and will include hotels, restaurants, and significant transport infrastructure upgrades.

It also aims to enhance the NHS app to provide patients with more direct control over their health records and appointments.

The maximum discounts available to tenants will also be significantly reduced.

Investigators used a combination of cell phone tracking, which placed Kohberger near the crime scene multiple times before the stabbings, and surveillance footage of his car. The critical breakthrough came from DNA found on a knife sheath left at the scene, which was matched to Kohberger through a Q-tip retrieved from his family's trash.
