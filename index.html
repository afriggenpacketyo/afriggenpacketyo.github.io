          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, the daughter of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was arrested at Columbia University during protests against Israel's actions in Gaza. She received a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing after students occupied Butler Library, renaming it the Basel al-Araj People’s University. The protests, aimed at urging the university to divest from funds supporting Israel's war efforts, led to clashes with police and numerous arrests. Columbia University temporarily suspended student journalists covering the event, but later lifted the suspensions following public outcry. The anti-war protests are occurring amid a broader crackdown on student activism across US universities.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have restarted trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, marking the first high-level discussions since the US imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, with China retaliating. The talks aim to de-escalate the trade war that has disrupted global markets and supply chains. Despite low expectations for a quick resolution, the fact that discussions are happening offers hope for easing tensions. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing that a prolonged trade conflict could lead to slower growth and higher prices worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After days of intense fighting, India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire, although reports of continued cross-border firing persist. The conflict escalated following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, with both sides launching missile and drone strikes targeting military bases. President Trump initially announced the cease-fire, claiming US mediation, a claim disputed by India. The ongoing tensions stem from the unresolved dispute over Kashmir, dating back to the 1947 partition, with both countries accusing each other of provocations and spreading disinformation. The fighting has resulted in casualties and widespread disruption, raising fears of a full-blown war.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home alternative to the Pap smear in the United States. Developed by Teal Health, the device uses a swab to collect vaginal samples that are then mailed to a lab for HPV testing. A study found at-home screening was as effective as in-office screenings and preferred by women, potentially increasing screening rates. At-home screenings are already available in other countries, and this approval aims to reduce cervical cancer rates by improving access and convenience.</p>

The identification was made using forensic investigative genetic genealogy. Kraft remains incarcerated and has denied committing any murders, though evidence suggests his involvement in multiple homicides.</p>

          <p>A DW article discusses how climate change is impacting bird migration patterns, with rising global temperatures and extreme weather events altering their journeys. Small crustaceans, an important food source for migratory birds, struggle to build their shells and skeletons in oceans made more acidic by having to absorb more carbon dioxide. Warmer temperatures can remove the threat of food scarcity, leading birds to shorten their routes or not flying back to their original habitat at all. The article emphasizes the importance of protecting habitats and reducing pollution to support migratory bird populations.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers, a long-standing leader in the diet industry, has filed for bankruptcy, struggling to compete with the growing popularity of weight loss injections like Mounjaro. The company has lost over a million members and is facing significant debt. Weight loss injections work by mimicking a hormone that suppresses appetite and promotes feelings of fullness. While WeightWatchers has also incorporated its own brand of weight loss injections into its program, it faces challenges from social media influencers and a shifting focus towards holistic well-being.</p>

          <p>Work to raise the superyacht "Bayesian" that sank off Sicily last year, resulting in the deaths of seven people, was suspended after a diver died during the operation. The diver was part of a team working to cut and remove the mast of the yacht. The accident prompted prosecutors to open an investigation into the death. The yacht sank after being struck by a storm, claiming the lives of British tech mogul Mike Lynch, his daughter, and five others.</p>
