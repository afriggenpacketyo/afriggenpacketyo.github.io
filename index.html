          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear facility, specifically the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant. Sources indicate Trump is becoming "comfortable" with the idea of striking the facility, potentially with multiple strikes using B-2 stealth bombers. This consideration comes as the Israelis discovered that they did not eliminate all Iranian air defenses as initially believed, adding to the security concerns. Trump is also gauging the reaction of his base to potential strikes and has been briefed on security at U.S. Army bases.</p>

Gabbard testified that U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, while Trump stated that Iran is "very close" to having one. This divergence mirrors arguments made during the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War.

          <p>Eugene Brown of Menifee, a known prankster, won $5 million in the lottery, but his wife initially didn't believe him, thinking it was a joke. She even calmly asked him to take out the garbage after he told her about the win. Brown bought the winning ticket at an ARCO ampm in Menifee while out with their toddler, after his wife asked him to take a break. He plans to pay off his house and put the rest into a trust.</p>

          <p>President Trump's shift in stance on Iran's nuclear capabilities has created a rift with his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and divisions within his MAGA base. Gabbard maintains that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, while Trump claims they are on the verge of acquiring one. This disagreement has led to Gabbard being excluded from meetings and reflects broader tensions over U.S. intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict. Trump's actions indicate a preference for displays of strength, aligning him with those advocating for military action against Iran.</p>

          <p>The government is changing the rules on who qualifies for the Warm Home Discount, allowing millions more households in Britain to receive £150 off their energy bills this winter. The qualification about property size, type, and home energy score is being scrapped. This change will benefit 2.7 million more homes, including almost a million households with children. The expansion of the Warm Home Discount will be paid for by energy companies and could potentially lead to a slight increase in bills for all customers.</p>

          <p>Karen Read, accused of killing her police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022, was found not guilty of murder in her second trial. The first trial collapsed in July 2024 due to a hung jury. Read was also acquitted of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene, but convicted of driving while intoxicated. The case drew significant public attention, and supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the verdict. Prosecutors and Read's attorneys agreed to a one-year probation sentence for the intoxication charge.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is terminating a specialized LGBTQ+ youth option within the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, sparking criticism from advocates. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced the closure of the "Press 3 option" on July 17. The Trevor Project criticized the decision, highlighting the program's life-saving services for over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people. Senator Tammy Baldwin condemned the move as cruelly removing a crucial resource for LGBTQ+ individuals in crisis.</p>
