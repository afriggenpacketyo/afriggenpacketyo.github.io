        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a controversial Republican-led redistricting bill, sending it to Governor Greg Abbott who has pledged to sign it swiftly. The new congressional map, which aims to create five new GOP-leaning districts, was advanced following a weekslong standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. This mid-decade redistricting effort, encouraged by former President Trump to bolster Republican seats ahead of the 2026 midterms, has prompted Democrats to vow legal challenges, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation. In response, California has initiated its own counter-redistricting plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, were denied parole this week after separate hearings. Parole commissioners cited the brothers' behavior while incarcerated as the primary reason for the denial, rather than the murders themselves. Erik Menendez was noted for involvement in fights and possessing contraband, while Lyle Menendez had a recent violation for using a prohibited mobile phone. Both expressed remorse for the killings, which they have long claimed were in self-defense against parental abuse, but the boards concluded they still exhibit anti-social traits like deception and rule-breaking.</p>

          <p>The Australian women's rugby team, known as the Wallaroos, secured their largest-ever World Cup victory with a decisive 73-0 win against Samoa. The match saw the team score a record 11 tries, including a first-half hat-trick from winger Desiree Miller, placing them at the top of their pool. The dominant performance marks a strong start to their tournament campaign, though it was against a significantly lower-ranked Samoan team competing in their first World Cup since 2014. Australia's next match against the United States will be a more crucial test for their quarter-final qualification hopes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent investigation found that users on Roblox, a popular online gaming platform, are circumventing moderation to spread hate speech, including swastikas and racist slurs. In games like "Spray Paint!", players can draw hateful messages instead of typing them in filtered chats, exposing the platform's large youth user base to extremist content. Despite Roblox stating it has a 24/7 moderation system and takes swift action, the platform faces numerous lawsuits over inappropriate content and child safety concerns. Experts and child safety advocates warn that these platforms can be used by predators to recruit or exploit young players.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the public college with the best return on investment in the United States, according to The Princeton Review. The ranking considers academics, financial aid, and overall cost to determine which schools offer the best value for students. Georgia Tech's strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math contributes to high post-graduation earnings for its students, reinforcing its value proposition.

          <p>Several major European postal services, including those in Germany, Sweden, and Italy, have suspended most merchandise shipments to the United States. The move is a response to new U.S. import duties, set to take effect on August 29, which will apply tariffs to international goods previously exempt if valued under $800. Postal operators cite a lack of clarity on the new rules and insufficient time to update their systems to ensure compliance before the deadline. The United Kingdom's Royal Mail and France's La Poste are also scheduled to halt shipments, creating significant disruption for transatlantic commerce and consumers.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has finally received his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by the severe abuse he suffered at the infamous Dozier School for Boys. In the 1960s, Horne was sent to the state-run reform school, which became known for its brutal beatings and neglect, causing him to drop out to support his family. He earned his diploma through a new state compensation program for victims of Dozier and a similar institution. Fulfilling a lifelong goal, Horne hopes his story inspires others to overcome major setbacks and never give up on their ambitions.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Empower found that Americans, on average, believe the ideal retirement age is 58, which is significantly younger than the current typical retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors warn that retiring this early presents considerable challenges, as it could mean funding a non-working period of 30 to 40 years. Key considerations include saving enough to withstand economic downturns and securing healthcare coverage for the years before Medicare eligibility at age 65. Many people who retire early do so for reasons other than financial stability, such as health or employment issues. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book, astrophysicist Adam Becker challenges the space colonization visions of tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, arguing that settling on Mars is a terrible idea. Becker describes Mars as an awful, inhospitable environment with no breathable air, lethal radiation, and poisoned soil, stating that even a post-catastrophe Earth would be more habitable. He contends that while robotic space exploration is valuable for science, the focus on Mars as a "Plan B" for humanity is a dangerous delusion. Instead of pursuing this fantasy, he urges that resources and focus should be directed toward solving Earth's problems and making our own planet a better place.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Zoo experienced a difficult week, mourning the deaths of three of its well-known animals: Kalluk, a 24-year-old polar bear; Nicky, a 28-year-old Masai giraffe; and Maka, a 30-year-old gorilla. Both Kalluk and Nicky, who was believed to be the oldest giraffe in North America, were euthanized due to declining health related to their advanced age. Maka, the leader of the zoo's gorilla troop, died unexpectedly from a cardiac event during a medical examination for a pre-existing condition. The nearly simultaneous losses of these beloved, long-term residents have been deeply felt by zoo staff and the community.</p>

          <p>A former elementary school teacher in Sacramento, Kim Kenneth Wilson, has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting numerous students. The 64-year-old used his position as the head of a campus broadcast club to groom and assault children in a private, soundproof room, often recording the acts. A search of his home uncovered a vast collection of these recordings along with other disturbing materials. The case has also led to civil lawsuits against the Twin Rivers Unified School District, alleging it failed to supervise Wilson and protect the students from his years of abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists are increasingly recommending tinted sunscreens because they offer protection against visible light, which standard sunscreens do not. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, the same pigment that gives the products their color. While regular sunscreens focus on blocking UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, tinted formulas provide the added benefit of preventing or mitigating these cosmetic but often distressing pigmentation issues, making them a more comprehensive form of sun protection.</p>

          <p>In South Africa's Mpumalanga province, thousands of unemployed men, known as "zama zamas," risk their lives daily by illegally mining coal from abandoned industrial sites. Forced by poverty, they work with rudimentary tools in extremely hazardous conditions, facing threats from tunnel collapses, toxic gas, and underground fires. While they provide an essential source of fuel for local communities, the government views them as criminals, and they face raids and extortion from police. This situation highlights a legacy of industrial mining that has enriched a few while leaving local communities with pollution, environmental damage, and few economic opportunities.</p>

The spectacle is visible from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and is being live-streamed by the U.S. Geological Survey. For Native Hawaiians, the eruption is a significant cultural event, seen as the work of the volcano goddess Pele and connecting them to ancestral stories and traditions.</p>

She denied the existence of a "client list" and claimed she did not introduce Prince Andrew to Epstein, suggesting it was Sarah Ferguson. Maxwell also called a famous photo of Prince Andrew with accuser Virginia Giuffre a fake and stated her belief that Epstein did not die by suicide.</p>

          <p>Americans are facing higher utility bills, with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the last year, and further increases expected. Experts attribute the rising prices largely to a surge in energy demand from data centers for artificial intelligence, electrified transportation, and renewed economic activity. While increasing the supply of renewable energy could lower costs, projects are stalled by transmission backlogs and policy changes from the Trump administration that favor fossil fuels and curtail clean energy development. The administration's actions, including keeping uneconomic coal plants online, are projected to further increase costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

A key part of the exercise saw British and U.S. F-35B fighter jets conducting landing and takeoff drills from the Japanese carrier JS Kaga. This event, described as a "major show of allied strength," highlights Japan's move to enhance tactical integration with a wider range of partners. Analysts suggest this strategy is driven by a need to build a more robust security network in the Indo-Pacific, with a particular eye on countering potential threats from China.</p>

The parents had given contradictory statements to law enforcement, raising suspicion early in the week-long search that had garnered national attention.
