          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts of 0.6%. According to the Office for National Statistics, this growth was primarily fueled by the UK services sector, with a notable contribution from the production sector as well. This indicates a positive start to the year for the UK economy, suggesting resilience despite global economic uncertainties. The figures reflect a potential upward trend in economic activity within the country. Optimism score is at 75.</p>

          <p>Russia has announced its delegation for peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey, notably excluding President Vladimir Putin, signaling a potential lack of high-level engagement. President Trump initially considered joining the meeting but will instead visit the United Arab Emirates, sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his place. Ukraine's President Zelensky expressed readiness for negotiations but emphasized the need for strong Western sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting.

          <p>Researchers have determined that a version of the Magna Carta held by Harvard University is an original from 1300, issued by King Edward I, rather than a copy as previously believed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alabama lawmakers have passed legislation providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for immunity hearings. Republicans argue the bill supports law enforcement, while Democrats fear it could embolden misconduct and disproportionately harm Black individuals. The bill allows a judge to decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties. The legislation also mandates law enforcement departments to track use of force complaints, adding a layer of accountability.</p>

This shift includes charging foreigners for public healthcare and education, a move criticized for challenging Argentina's tradition of openness.

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. Despite projections of moderating growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact. Danish drugmakers rely on a 'merchanting and processing' system, where most of the value is attributable to intellectual property, with manufacturing outsourced to other countries.

The decision comes amid a rice shortage partly due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased consumption from foreign tourists.

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a tax bill that would cut billions of dollars in climate-related funding and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump's tax cuts.
