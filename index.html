          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, claiming that the American movie industry is dying and that foreign incentives to attract filmmakers pose a national security threat. He argues that these incentives constitute messaging and propaganda, and he aims to bring movie production back to America. The details of the proposed tariffs are unclear, including whether they would apply to American production companies filming abroad or to films on streaming services. This action is the latest in a series of tariffs imposed by Trump, aimed at boosting US manufacturers and protecting jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to labor disputes and a debt crisis, forcing some pilots to find alternative means of income, such as food delivery. The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs using Chinese-made aircraft. The suspension is primarily attributed to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed railway networks offer cheaper alternatives. This impedes Joy Air's ability to generate healthy cash flow and negatively impacts the company's operations, leaving its employees in a difficult position.</p>

Trump's administration has been clashing with the courts over his policies on sending alleged gang members to prisons, and this decision is seen as a symbolic gesture to project a tough stance on crime.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top donor, while Japan's aid was estimated at $16.8 billion, a decrease mainly attributed to the yen's depreciation. The decline contrasted with sharp increases in previous years due to resumed development projects after COVID-19 suspensions. Japan views ODA as a key diplomatic tool, but faces fiscal constraints. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, primarily due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>

Some owners are considering relocating to provinces with lower wages or to countries like Vietnam to avoid tariffs.

          <p>As high tariffs disrupt U.S. orders for Chinese goods, China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market, a move that threatens to drive the economy into deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting efforts to redirect products to Chinese consumers, leading to a ferocious price war among Chinese firms. This influx of discounted goods could erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment, contributing to weak consumer demand. After hovering just above zero, the consumer price index slipped into negative territory, and the producer price index fell for a 29th consecutive month.</p>
