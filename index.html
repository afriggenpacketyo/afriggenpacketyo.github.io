          <p>Oil prices experienced a decrease of 2% due to the announcement of an Iran-Israel ceasefire, which alleviated concerns regarding supply disruptions and the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz. The Ice Brent contract for August expiry was trading at $69.76 per barrel, while the front-month August Nymex WTI contract was at $66.85 per barrel. Despite these declines, oil prices had previously increased by roughly 10% due to hostilities between Iran and Israel. The International Energy Agency has reassured markets that it possesses 1.2 billion barrels of emergency stockpiles, and some OPEC+ alliance members have been increasing output.

          <p>Royal experts have commented on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision not to release a public statement after Tyler Perry was sued for alleged sexual harassment, assault, and retaliation. Some experts suggest that their silence demonstrates a lack of moral courage, while others believe they are in a lose-lose situation. One expert noted that Tyler Perry was one of the few A-listers who fiercely defended the Sussexes, and their silence looks completely self-serving. The experts suggest that Harry and Meghan's refusal to get involved is clearly an act of self-preservation.</p>

          <p>As global temperatures rise and heatwaves intensify, cities are appointing "heat officers" to build resilience against extreme heat through strategies like urban greening and creating cool zones. These officers analyze local conditions, develop plans, and implement protective measures, including heat-repellent infrastructure. Eleni Myrivili, the global chief heat officer at the Atlantic Council's Climate Resilience Center, emphasizes proactive adaptation and long-term planning. With extreme heat linked to half a million annual deaths, cities like Phoenix and Barcelona are establishing cooling centers and heat action plans.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine Corps member stationed in Okinawa Prefecture was sentenced to seven years in prison by a Japanese district court for a sexual assault that occurred in May of the previous year.

The Naha District Court found the victim's testimonies highly credible, stating that Clayton choked her from behind and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her.

          <p>An intense heat dome is causing record-breaking temperatures across the Eastern U.S., with some areas experiencing triple-digit heat for the first time in over a decade. The heat wave is particularly dangerous due to its early arrival in the summer, before people have acclimated to warmer conditions. Meteorologists note that a key measurement of the high pressure system broke a record, making this a near-historic event. Climate change has increased the likelihood of such heat waves, with summers in the U.S. being 2.4 degrees hotter than 50 years ago.</p>

The MPs have signed an amendment that would give them an opportunity to vote on a proposal to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety. The welfare reform bill - called the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill - will include proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The amendment notes the need for reform but cites concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. The spending will be divided, with 3.5% dedicated to core defense and the remaining 1.5% to defense-related areas such as resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need for agility and a clear sense of national interest in an era of radical uncertainty. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then.</p>

          <p>The number of students enrolled in Japanese schools in mainland China has decreased by over 10% in the academic year starting April, marking a decline amid economic challenges and safety concerns. These concerns stem from incidents like a knife attack near Shanghai in June last year and a fatal stabbing in Shenzhen. Increased security measures have been implemented at Japanese schools, but some parents remain worried about the safety of their children. The 80th anniversary of the end of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression may also worsen public sentiment toward Japanese nationals.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II and promote political integration on the continent. The organization functions as a collective security alliance, providing mutual defense through military and political means if a member state is threatened. Article 5 of the charter, the collective defense clause, is its cornerstone. The alliance has expanded since the end of the Cold War, incorporating several former Warsaw Pact countries and most recently Sweden.</p>

Investors appear to be showing signs of fatigue toward Trump's policymaking, leading to subdued market reactions. The MSCI World index saw a slight increase, and U.S. futures also edged higher. Some analysts suggest the market is becoming desensitized to policy changes, with each successive change resulting in less significant market movement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article suggests that President Trump is more inclined to heed Israel's views on Iran and is skeptical of the U.S. intelligence community's assessments. Trump's administration, by firing staffers at the National Security Council and conducting an ideological purge, has signaled a disinterest in consulting experts on Iran and the Middle East. This approach contrasts with past administrations that relied on intelligence community assessments, which have consistently stated that Iran has an enrichment program but has not built a bomb. Without evidence of weaponization, the debate has devolved into theological disputes over the significance of changes in Iran's uranium enrichment program.</p>

          <p>Western airlines are at risk of experiencing greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. The conflict, compounded by US military strikes, forces most carriers to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, which Chinese companies continue to use, giving the latter a competitive advantage. The situation may widen the existing competitive gap between Chinese airlines and others.</p>

The new target, which includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for related areas, would require substantial additional funding. Experts suggest that financing these expenses may necessitate loans, budget cuts, and tax increases.

Byrne's letter to Sir Keir Starmer highlights fears that the "duty of candour" obligation has been removed from a draft version of the bill.
