          <p>After a 17-year delay, a Chinese state-owned company is making significant progress on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, one of the world's largest untapped deposits. The project, awarded in 2008, was stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and landmines. The Taliban-led government has now approved a switch to underground mining to better protect the historical relics. The company stated it could begin extraction this year if final procedures with the government proceed smoothly, signaling a potential economic development for the region.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of Democratic State Representative Gene Wu, whom he labeled the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Dozens of Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a contentious redistricting plan. Abbott's legal action claims Wu abandoned his office, while Wu maintains he was fulfilling his constitutional duty to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map." The move escalates a high-stakes political standoff over electoral boundaries in the state.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murders and a 4.5% fall in overall violent crime. Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% reduction, with motor vehicle thefts falling by a record 18.6%. While experts note these trends continue a post-pandemic decline, hate crimes saw only a slight decrease, with antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents reportedly on the rise.

The measure aims to protect tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law, which takes effect next month but won't be enforced until 2027, applies to both new and old buildings. Officials are encouraging passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, positioning the ordinance as a necessary public health protection for vulnerable residents.</p>

The drop comes after a recent period of intense investor interest that saw the stock price surge. CEO Carrie Wheeler acknowledged the new "enthusiasm" for the company but noted that the housing market has continued to deteriorate due to high mortgage rates. The company is now focusing on a strategic shift toward a less capital-intensive referrals business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released its first open-weight artificial intelligence models since 2019, designed to provide lower-cost and more accessible options for developers and researchers. The new models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, can be run on a variety of hardware, from laptops to the cloud, and compete with similar offerings from companies like Meta and Mistral. After delaying the launch for additional safety reviews, OpenAI stated the models underwent extensive testing to mitigate potential misuse. This move marks a significant step for OpenAI into the growing open-weight AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has ended with the arrest of Austin Robert Drummond, the man suspected of killing four members of his girlfriend's family in rural Tennessee. The victims included the parents, grandmother, and teenage uncle of a baby who was found abandoned on a stranger's doorstep, which triggered the investigation. Drummond, who has a prior felony conviction, was captured after a public sighting and a shelter-in-place order. He now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder, in what authorities have described as a targeted killing spree.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 19:05:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant improvements in accuracy, public perception of weather forecasting often includes skepticism, a phenomenon explored in this article by a lead weather forecaster. The challenge lies in communicating vast amounts of complex data and inherent uncertainty, as the atmosphere is a chaotic system where small errors can lead to large changes. While technology like new supercomputers and AI models promise even better predictions, the core difficulty remains boiling down probabilities for specific micro-locations into a simple, digestible forecast. The future of forecasting may involve more creative communication and focusing on the real-world impacts of weather events.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they were irresponsible for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog noted that factors like posing, shadows, and clothing style made the models appear gaunt and their collarbones overly prominent. Zara, which has since removed the images, stated the models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, highlighting ongoing scrutiny of body image representation in the fashion industry.</p>

With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary students, many families face significant financial strain.
