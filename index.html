        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case regarding the extent to which public schools must accommodate religious objections to curriculum materials, specifically concerning LGBTQ+ content. The case centers on a Montgomery County, MD school system that included storybooks with LGBTQ+ characters to promote tolerance. Some parents objected, citing conflicts with their religious beliefs and requested opt-outs for their children. The court is grappling with balancing local school boards' authority to determine curriculum and parents' rights to guide their children's values and religious freedom. Relevant context is that the current court has been increasingly focused on the First Amendment guarantee to the free exercise of religion.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the withholding of funds violates Harvard's constitutional rights and is being used to control academic decision-making.

          <p>China's economy is showing signs of recovery, spurred by the government's stimulus package implemented in September 2024. First-quarter GDP growth reached 5.4%, continuing an acceleration from the previous year. Policymakers acknowledged the issue of falling demand, particularly in the real estate market, and allowed local governments to expand debt financing through long-term bonds. These measures aim to stabilize the property and stock markets, mitigating the slowdown in consumer spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft, aiming to balance league parity with player agency. Proposals include flipping the draft order, implementing a draft lottery, waiving the eligibility rule, and using a salary pool system. Flipping the draft order would reward teams closer to the playoffs, while a lottery could introduce more randomness and drama. Waiving the eligibility rule would allow players to enter the draft earlier, and a salary pool would give players more control over their destination and compensation. These ideas seek to address the current system's limitations and empower players in their career choices.</p>

          <p>CATL, the world's largest supplier of EV batteries, claims its second-generation Shenxing battery can add 323 miles of driving range in just five minutes of charging. This claim positions CATL ahead of BYD, which recently announced a system that could add approximately 248 miles in the same time. If feasible on a larger scale, this technology could alleviate consumer concerns about electric vehicle range and convenience. CATL's claims would also surpass charging speeds offered by Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz.</p>

The tariff of 145% on most Chinese-made products, combined with the cancellation of a tax exemption for articles valued under $800, has impacted their business models. The companies are encouraging customers to continue shopping in the coming days before the price adjustments take effect.</p>
