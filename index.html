            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 09:10:47 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Investors nearing retirement should prepare for potential market volatility by rebalancing their portfolios and building cash reserves. Financial advisors recommend shifting assets to a more conservative 60/40 investment portfolio, diversifying investments, and maintaining two years' worth of income in cash. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of selling investments during market downturns, known as sequence of returns risk, and provides retirees with the confidence to cover living expenses while their portfolio recovers. Consider also a bond ladder to ensure consistent income.</p>

            <p>The author reflects on a peculiar lie told on a first date 30 years ago, sparking a broader consideration of dishonesty in dating. While egregious lies about relationship status or intentions are harmful, smaller lies often stem from insecurity or attempts at kindness. The article explores the spectrum of dating deceit, from catfishing to butler lies, and questions whether all fibbing is inherently awful. The author suggests that some lies are attempts to present a better version of oneself, akin to wearing Spanx or Cuban heels.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is set to argue its case for breaking up Google in the final phase of a landmark antitrust trial. The government contends that Google illegally stifled competition by paying phone makers to set Google as the default search engine and is seeking remedies such as spinning off the Chrome browser and potentially selling the Android operating system. Google argues that these measures would harm consumers and innovation, while antitrust experts believe the case could redefine digital market regulation. The outcome could significantly impact the tech landscape and innovation.</p>

This move would significantly strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate, challenging the dominance of the US dollar. With strong manufacturing capabilities, China can support substantial trade volume with the US, compelling the latter to purchase Chinese currency on a large scale.

            <p>The conflict between Donald Trump and Harvard University is the latest front in a long-standing conservative campaign against academia. This battle, dating back to Ronald Reagan and McCarthyism, involves attempts to control higher education and undermine its independence. The Trump administration's actions, including freezing grants and demanding control over hiring and curriculum, are seen as an assault on democracy and freedom of thought. Harvard's refusal to comply represents a stand against governmental overreach and an effort to protect academic freedom.</p>

            <p>The article draws parallels between Adolf Hitler's economic policies in the 1930s and modern trade wars, highlighting the use of tariffs as a tool for nationalist agendas. Hitler's tariffs, aimed at protecting German farmers and industry, led to retaliatory measures and strained international relations. Despite inheriting a recovering economy, Hitler's protectionist policies created uncertainty and disrupted trade, ultimately hindering economic progress. The article serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of trade wars and the importance of international cooperation.</p>

            <p>The United States risks losing its trade war with China due to its dependence on Chinese goods and the Trump administration's approach. China's ability to redirect exports and implement economic weapons gives it an advantage. While the US could win by joining forces with allies, the Trump administration's actions have alienated potential partners. A Chinese victory would embolden Beijing and weaken the US economy, potentially leading to greater aggression and instability.</p>

A recent study analyzed satellite imagery from 2000 to 2020 and found that 66% of the newly exposed coastline was in Greenland. The retreat of marine-terminating glaciers can have important impacts on local ecosystems and Arctic communities, increasing the susceptibility to landslide-triggered tsunamis. The Arctic has warmed up to four times faster than the rest of the planet, causing Greenland's ice sheet to thin dramatically.</p>
