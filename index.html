          <h2>U.S. Expands Social Media Vetting for Student Visa Applicants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 13:04:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department is expanding social media screening for student visa applications, prompting concerns among international student advisors. These advisors are urging students to carefully review and potentially purge their social media accounts of content that could be perceived as radical or anti-American. The new vetting measures build upon existing policies that consider antisemitic activity on social media as grounds for denying immigration benefits. Critics argue that this increased scrutiny could inhibit freedom of expression and discourage students from expressing their views on sensitive topics, potentially leading to self-censorship. The measures are designed to ensure that individuals entering the country do not pose a national security risk, according to the White House, which is prioritizing the safety of Americans. The current administration believes it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States. The Optimism score will be based on the reality of how this will affect the lives of students who are just trying to get an education, which is a neutral event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by Enders Analysis accuses Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of enabling the widespread piracy of premium video services, particularly live sports. The report points to Amazon's Fire Stick as a key device used to access illegal streams, arguing it facilitates "billions of dollars in piracy". The researchers criticize big tech firms for their "ambivalence and inertia" in addressing the problem, which costs broadcasters revenue and exposes users to cyber-crime risks. Sky and DAZN executives have warned that piracy is causing a financial crisis in the broadcast industry, as illegal streams can attract tens of thousands of viewers per event. Amazon says it is vigilant in its efforts to combat piracy and protect customers from associated risks.</p>

          <h2>Millennials Express Hesitation About Having Children Due to Evolving Views on Harm and Parenting Standards</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay in *The New York Times* explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, with the U.S. fertility rate hitting a record low in 2023. The author suggests that one overlooked reason is the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma," leading to heightened expectations for parents. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, citing emotional or relational struggles previously considered normal. This cultural shift has created an almost impossible standard for parenting, requiring parents to provide not only basic needs but also ensure their children's career success and mental well-being into adulthood. The sentiment surrounding the reasons for the trend is not particularly positive, although the trend itself is not necessarily negative.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Switzerland has achieved significant success in predicting landslides through advanced technologies and continuous monitoring of environmental factors. The recent landslide in Blatten, where early warnings allowed for evacuation, highlights the effectiveness of these measures. Swiss authorities maintain hazard risk maps for every community affected by hazards, mandated by federal regulations. Despite this success, predicting landslides remains a challenge globally, especially in mountainous regions vulnerable to climate change. International efforts, such as the UN's Early Warnings for All initiative, aim to improve global preparedness and save lives from natural hazards. The fact that people were able to evacuate the town in time points to the fact that we are moving in the right direction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican plan for student loans could extend repayment terms up to 30 years, raising concerns about borrowers being in debt for an extended period. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz describes a 30-year repayment term as "indentured servitude." The House-passed bill proposes just two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan (IDR) called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), which forgives loans after three decades. Monthly payments under RAP would vary between 1% and 10% of a borrower's income. Preston Cooper from the American Enterprise Institute argues that the plan ensures borrowers eventually pay off their principal. This is a financial matter pertaining to governmental regulation, finance, or the economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration asserts that New York's ban on Native American mascots violates civil rights law. Federal education officials claim the policy discriminates against Native Americans after the state forced a Long Island school district to abandon its "Chief" mascot. This is a reflection of the current political climate. The administration is standing up for what it believes in.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order allowing the Trump administration to remove protections for approximately 500,000 immigrants in the United States. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing the decision was premature and that the administration had not demonstrated irreparable harm. The ruling permits the Trump administration to strip these immigrants of their right to remain in the United States. This has implications for the lives of the immigrants who are affected.</p>

          <p>The UK Treasury announced the sale of its final shares in NatWest Group, marking the end of government ownership nearly two decades after the 2008 financial crisis bailout. The government spent £45 billion to acquire an 84% stake in RBS, now part of NatWest Group, to prevent its collapse. Experts debate whether banks are now safer and whether taxpayers would need to step in again during a future financial crisis. The governor of the Bank of England says there are now alternative methods of rescuing a failing bank, including buying assets and providing emergency cash, which would allow them to handle bank crises without using public money. This is a financial matter pertaining to governmental regulation, finance, or the economy (not investment advice).</p>
