          <p>A pilot was killed when their small plane crashed into two homes in a Simi Valley neighborhood in Ventura County, California. The FAA reported that the pilot was the only person on board the Vans RV-10, which had departed from William J. Fox Airfield in Lancaster en route to Camarillo Airport. The Ventura County Fire Department confirmed that the impacted two-story homes sustained fire and structural damage, but residents were safely evacuated with no injuries. Authorities have closed the area for investigation by the FAA and NTSB, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days and a full report potentially taking up to two years.</p>

          <p>The death of Kendy Howard in her bathtub, initially reported as a suicide by her husband Dan Howard, a former state trooper, is under scrutiny due to inconsistencies at the scene. Investigators noted the lack of blood, a running dryer full of clean towels, and Dan Howard's seemingly composed demeanor despite claiming to have found his wife dead. Kendy had reportedly told friends she wanted a divorce and had been having an affair, leading investigators to suspect Dan Howard may have staged the scene, potentially using a carotid restraint technique he knew from his law enforcement background. Dan Howard was eventually charged and convicted of second-degree murder.</p>

The incident highlights Sweden's growing issue with gun violence, often linked to criminal networks, and has prompted discussions about stricter gun laws and measures to prevent youth involvement in gangs.</p>
