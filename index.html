            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight. Putin stated the ceasefire was for humanitarian reasons, urging Ukraine to reciprocate, while also instructing Russian troops to prepare for potential violations. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, proposing an extension beyond Easter to demonstrate genuine intent, while Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha criticized the limited duration compared to a rejected 30-day ceasefire proposal. This announcement follows a prisoner exchange and Secretary of State Marco Rubio's frustration with stalled peace talks.</p>

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to open in 750 schools across England, offering half an hour of free childcare for parents before school starts. The program, part of a Labour initiative, aims to provide up to 95 additional hours of childcare per year, potentially saving parents £450 annually. However, teaching unions have raised concerns that government funding may not adequately cover the costs, potentially straining already tight school budgets. The headteachers union welcomes the expansion but stresses the importance of addressing funding issues before a national rollout.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers successfully detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen-based explosive device, triggering intense chemical reactions without nuclear materials. The 2kg bomb produced a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, far longer than TNT blasts. Developed by CSSC's 705 Research Institute, the device uses a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. When activated, the magnesium hydride rapidly decomposes, releasing hydrogen gas that ignites into a sustained inferno.</p>
