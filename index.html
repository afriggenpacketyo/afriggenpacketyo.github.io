          <p>The Indiana Fever were defeated by the New York Liberty with a score of 98-77 in their final game before the WNBA All-Star break. The Fever's star rookie, Caitlin Clark, was sidelined just before the game due to a groin injury, her second of the season. Her absence was felt as the Liberty, led by Breanna Stewart's 24 points, controlled the game from the start. Clark's availability for the upcoming All-Star weekend, where she is a team captain and 3-point contest participant, is now uncertain as the team prioritizes her long-term health.</p>

          <p>Israeli military forces conducted airstrikes in Damascus, hitting the Syrian defense ministry and other government targets for a third consecutive day. The strikes come amid deadly sectarian clashes in the Suweida province between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, which have reportedly killed over 350 people. Israel's Prime Minister stated the intervention aims to protect the Druze community, while Syria's interim government has accused Israel of a "large-scale escalation." The U.S. has announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to de-escalate the violence in the region.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Aims to Sell More Advanced Chips to China Following H20 Ban Reversal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 00:20:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has expressed his hope to sell more advanced semiconductors to China, beyond the recently reinstated H20 AI chip. This statement follows the company's decision to resume sales of the H20, a chip designed to comply with U.S. export controls. Huang emphasized that as technology advances, the chips available to China should also improve over time. The move highlights Nvidia's strategy to navigate U.S.-China trade tensions and recapture market share in the significant Chinese AI market, which it estimates could be worth $50 billion.</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that a key federal grant program for fentanyl overdose prevention, which is currently underfunded by $140 million, will be paid out in increments rather than a single annual payment. This announcement for the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program, run by the CDC, comes after internal concerns were raised about potential delays or the disappearance of funds. While the administration insists the program is not threatened, some CDC staff and state health officials worry that the lack of a clear timeline and contractual commitment could disrupt essential public health services and planning.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers are expressing that a new push to modernize equipment fails to address more critical underlying problems like chronic staffing shortages, low morale, and grueling work schedules. Despite recent government initiatives to upgrade technology and hire more staff, many controllers feel their core concerns about stagnating pay and mandatory six-day workweeks are being ignored. The staffing crisis, which forces many facilities to operate with thousands fewer controllers than needed, leads to exhaustion and stress. Controllers argue these quality-of-life issues are paramount to ensuring the safety and efficiency of the U.S. air travel system.</p>

For instance, the entire Office of Casualty Assistance, which supports families of employees who die overseas, was reportedly fired.

Automobile exports to the U.S. were hit particularly hard, falling 26.7% as carmakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share.

Governor Gavin Newsom vowed to fight the action, stating the state is "putting all options on the table." The project, which aims to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, has faced significant delays and its cost has ballooned from an initial $33 billion to a projected $128 billion, becoming a point of political contention.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the murders of "American Idol" executive Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, both 70. The couple was found shot to death in their Encino, California, home during a wellness check. Police believe the suspect, Raymond Boodarian, gained entry through an unlocked door and a confrontation occurred when the couple returned home. The incident appears to be a random attack, and investigators used surveillance video and facial recognition software to identify and apprehend the suspect, who was booked on suspicion of murder.</p>

          <p>A massive afforestation project in northern China, known as the 'Green Great Wall,' has successfully eased desertification but may be an unintended cause of widespread hay fever. Chinese scientists have confirmed that pollen from the artemisia plant, which is used extensively in the project due to its low cost and ease of cultivation, is a primary allergen. A new study identified five specific volatile components in the plant's pollen that can trigger allergic reactions. This research provides a scientific basis for developing treatments for the growing number of people suffering from pollen-related allergies in the region.</p>

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging a coordinated effort to unlawfully arrest and deport people attending their own immigration court hearings. The lawsuit claims that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have colluded to turn courthouses into traps, violating due process rights. The plaintiffs, many of whom were seeking asylum from persecution, argue this policy strips them of a fair hearing and instills fear, discouraging compliance with legal obligations. This legal challenge targets what advocates call a weaponization of the immigration court system.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to sustainable energy, used electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to power energy-intensive AI data centers. Companies like Crusoe and Redwood Materials are creating systems where old EV batteries, which may have lost some capacity but are still functional, store solar energy to provide a reliable, 24/7 power source. This strategy addresses the AI industry's growing demand for electricity while providing a second life for batteries that would otherwise be discarded. This innovative solution could help mitigate the environmental impact of the AI boom by creating a more circular and renewable energy economy.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized President Trump's deployment of the National Guard for immigration enforcement, calling it a costly effort to appear "tough" while terrorizing communities. His comments came after the Pentagon ordered the withdrawal of half the troops from Los Angeles, a move Newsom claims was made after realizing the absurdity of the deployment. Newsom argued the operation's main goal was not pursuing violent criminals but instilling fear, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars. The governor also repeated a threat to redraw California's congressional districts to favor Democrats in response to similar GOP efforts.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria have drawn attention to the Druze, an Arabic-speaking ethno-religious minority central to the escalating conflict. The violence began with deadly clashes between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin fighters in southern Syria, prompting Israel to intervene, stating it aims to protect the Druze community from pro-government forces. This article explains that the Druze have a unique identity and have historically navigated a precarious position in Syria. Israel's intervention is also a strategic move to prevent Islamist fighters from establishing a presence near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, creating a complex geopolitical situation.</p>

This issue was highlighted by a recent raid on a Nebraska meat processing plant where over 70 workers were arrested, despite the owner's reliance on the system. While the government promotes E-Verify for providing "peace of mind," critics say it primarily vets paperwork, not people, allowing fraudulent documents to pass.
