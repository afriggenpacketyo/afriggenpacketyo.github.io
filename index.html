          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to phase out the remaining eight artificial food dyes from America’s food supply within two years, targeting their use in common foods like cereal, ice cream, and snacks. This initiative follows the previous administration's move to ban Red No. 3 due to cancer concerns in rats, with Kennedy seeking to remove all other petroleum-based dyes approved by the FDA. The move comes amid growing concerns about the potential health effects of these dyes, including allergic reactions and hyperactivity in children, and aligns with similar bans or warning labels in other countries.</p>

          <p>A swimmer is missing after a rare shark attack off the coast of Hadera, Israel, marking the first such incident since the country's founding in 1948. Witnesses reported the attack near a power plant where sharks are known to gather due to the warm water discharge. Police have closed the beach and initiated a search for the missing individual. The incident is unusual as sharks in the area are generally considered harmless, raising concerns among local authorities and beachgoers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's beer exports have decreased by 6% over the past decade, while domestic consumption has significantly dropped by 15.1%, as revealed by the Federal Statistical Office. Despite this decline, the number of breweries in Germany has increased, although not as high as in 2019. The statistics were released ahead of German Beer Day, which celebrates the Reinheitsgebot or Purity Law adopted in 1516, emphasizing the use of only water, barley, and hops in beer production. The decline in beer consumption may be attributed to a growing awareness of the negative health consequences of drinking.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar briefly fell below 140 yen for the first time since last September after former President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. The yen was also bought on speculation that the U.S. administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness against the dollar when the Japanese and U.S. finance ministers are expected to meet in Washington this week. Trump's comments raised concerns about the central bank's independence, accelerating dollar selling. Tokyo stocks ended mixed, while the benchmark price of gold hit an all-time high in yen terms as investors sought safe-haven assets.</p>

The move comes as Chinese companies seek alternative funding sources amid domestic economic challenges and increased regulatory scrutiny.

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has been ordered by a U.S. District Court in Georgia to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose statuses were unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively ending the students' statuses and making them deportable. The judge also ordered the government not to use the identities of the plaintiffs outside of the lawsuit, with a hearing set for Thursday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists indicates a growing concern that the United States is shifting away from liberal democracy toward authoritarianism. The survey, conducted by Bright Line Watch, reveals a significant decline in the perceived performance of American democracy since President Trump's election. Scholars point to attempts to expand executive power, attacks on the media, and the erosion of checks and balances as indicators of this trend. While some disagree, many experts worry about the potential for competitive authoritarianism, where a leader undermines democratic institutions after coming to power democratically.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) have reported promising results from a phase 1 trial using stem cells to treat advanced Parkinson’s disease. The therapy involves transplanting nerve cells created from donated stem cells into the brains of patients, aiming to produce dopamine and alleviate symptoms. After 18 months, the injected cells had successfully integrated into the brain with no serious side effects, and participants experienced noticeable improvements, particularly those receiving a higher dose. Based on these findings, the FDA has approved a phase 3 clinical trial with a larger patient group.</p>

The lawsuit claims that the withholding of federal funding violates Harvard's constitutional rights and is being used to control academic decision-making.

          <p>Thousands of properties in west Devon, including homes, schools, and leisure centers, remain without water supplies following a burst water pipe. South West Water (SWW) is working to restore water supplies, but the process is complex and may take time. Schools have been forced to close, and bottled water stations have been set up for residents. SWW has prioritized support for its most vulnerable customers and will offer compensation payments to those affected as a gesture of goodwill.</p>

          <p>Reports suggest that Russia is using Libya's infrastructure for human trafficking and smuggling to further its interests in the Mediterranean and exert pressure on the European Union. Russian ships and mercenaries, including the former Wagner Group, are allegedly involved in transporting weapons and migrants from Asia and Africa to Libya, from where they are smuggled into Europe. The situation is exacerbated by the involvement of figures like Saddam Haftar, who facilitates the smuggling operations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft to address concerns about player agency and franchise parity. Proposals include flipping the draft order to reward teams closer to the playoffs, implementing a lottery system for non-playoff teams, waiving the eligibility rule to allow players to enter the draft earlier, and creating a salary pool for rookies to negotiate contracts. These ideas aim to balance the league's desire for parity with giving players more control over their careers and preventing struggling franchises from consistently benefiting from top draft picks. Each system has its potential drawbacks and benefits, prompting a discussion on how to improve the draft process.</p>

          <p>The climate crisis is intensifying the global affordable housing shortage, with extreme weather events and natural disasters eroding housing stock and driving up prices. Climate gentrification, where high-income individuals move to higher-elevation areas to escape climate risks, is displacing low-income residents. Post-disaster housing becomes even more expensive, with insurance costs also skyrocketing. Experts argue that increasing housing supply, shifting density to low-risk areas, and implementing climate-resilient retrofitting are crucial for addressing both affordability and climate risks.</p>
