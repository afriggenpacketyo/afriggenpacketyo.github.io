          <p>Karolina Zurawska, a mother with paranoid schizophrenia, received an indefinite hospital order for the manslaughter of her six-year-old son, Alexander Zurawski, in Swansea. Zurawska admitted to the crime on the grounds of diminished responsibility, claiming she was being "instructed by a demonic force" at the time of the incident. The court emphasized that the order was for medical help, not punishment, acknowledging Zurawska's deteriorated mental state due to concerns and care for Alexander. The boy was found with a significant neck injury, and a post-mortem examination confirmed a complex sharp force injury to the neck area.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's calls for a quick resolution in Ukraine, President Putin is intensifying Russia's attacks, including airstrikes on civilian targets, while maintaining talks with the White House envoy. Putin openly admitted to bombing a restaurant, claiming it housed individuals "deserving the most serious punishment." This creates a tense negotiation dynamic with Trump, who has expressed his disapproval of the attacks, but Putin remains confident that energy deals and sanctions relief could still be in Moscow's favor. The situation presents a high-stakes game of chicken between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>As part of ongoing negotiations with the U.S. regarding tariffs, the Japanese government is considering increasing imports of U.S. soybeans and corn. This move aims to absorb excess supply resulting from decreased U.S. exports to China due to trade friction. Japan hopes that by increasing imports, they can secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum. The U.S. has expressed dissatisfaction with the number of U.S.-made cars imported into Japan and is pushing for greater access for U.S. rice, meat, and potatoes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts predict that annual energy bills in the UK will fall by £166 in July, potentially reversing three consecutive increases in Ofgem's price cap. This would bring a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to £1,683, the lowest level since last September. However, analysts caution that significant uncertainty surrounds these forecasts, as the market is vulnerable to geopolitical and market shifts. The predicted fall is attributed to a drop in the wholesale cost of energy, influenced by US tariffs policy and warmer-than-expected weather in Europe.</p>

          <p>Amherst College, historically known for its diversity, is facing an identity crisis after Black enrollment in the freshman class dropped to 3 percent, a significant decrease from the overall Black student body of 11 percent. This decline has sparked concern and reflection within the Amherst community, particularly among Black students who feel a shift in engagement and participation. The decrease in Black enrollment raises questions about the college's commitment to diversity and inclusion, especially in the wake of changes to affirmative action policies.</p>

          <p>A recent episode of Joe Rogan's podcast, featuring British writer Douglas Murray, has exposed a growing divide within the Roganverse, a collection of comics and podcasters. Murray criticized Rogan's decision to platform guests with controversial views, particularly regarding World War II. This has sparked a broader debate about the responsibility of influential platforms to moderate discourse and the role of expertise in political and historical discussions. The conflict highlights a deeper fissure within the American right, particularly regarding foreign policy and the role of the United States in safeguarding freedom abroad.</p>

          <p>Ryan Hemphill, a private equity executive, has been indicted on 116 counts, including predatory sexual assault, for allegedly torturing six women in his New York City apartment. Prosecutors described the apartment as a "torture chamber of grotesque sexual violence," where Hemphill allegedly punched, waterboarded, and shocked victims with a cattle prod, recording the assaults. Hemphill, who met the women through websites, faces a potential life sentence if convicted, and investigators believe there may be more victims, as his apartment contained numerous surveillance cameras and a large amount of drugs. The arraignment happened down the hall from Harvey Weinstein's rape retrial.</p>

This amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill aims to align cycling offenses with driving offenses, increasing penalties for serious injury or death caused by dangerous or careless cycling. The government estimates that four deaths last year were caused by cyclists, and the new legislation seeks to ensure that those who recklessly disregard others face the full force of the law.

          <p>Ukraine's delegation reaffirmed its core principles for ending the war with Russia during a meeting with allies in London. These principles include refusing to recognize any Ukrainian territory as Russian, opposing any country's veto power over Ukraine's alliances, and rejecting restrictions on its armed forces. President Zelenskyy emphasized the constructive nature of the talks, while reiterating Ukraine's desire to join NATO. The US has pushed for a quick end to the war, but Ukraine insists on maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, has indicated that Ukraine may need to cede territory as part of a peace agreement with Russia, amidst growing pressure from President Trump. Klitschko stated that giving up territory could bring "temporary peace," but emphasized that Ukrainians would "never accept occupation" by Russia. His comments come after a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv, highlighting the ongoing conflict. Klitschko's statement marks one of the most senior Ukrainian politician to suggest the possibility of territorial concessions, while noting his political opposition to Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>Germany is considering phasing out 1 and 2-cent euro coins, following similar moves by other European nations. The National Cash Forum, supported by the Bundesbank, argues that these coins are not needed due to cost savings, efficiency, and reduced environmental impact. The proposal involves rounding cash payments to the nearest 5 cents, while electronic payments would still allow for precise accounting. While many countries have dropped low-denomination coins, Germans still prefer cash transactions.</p>

The industry also fears that other administration policies, such as cuts to vocational training and immigration restrictions, will hinder the growth of the domestic apparel sector.</p>
