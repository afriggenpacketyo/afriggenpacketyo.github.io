          <p>OpenAI has announced that its nonprofit arm will retain control of the company as it restructures into a public benefit corporation, a decision influenced by civic leaders and former employees. This move comes after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware, and aims to ensure the company's mission remains consistent despite commercialization efforts. CEO Sam Altman expressed satisfaction with the decision, emphasizing the alignment of the nonprofit and PBC missions, but the company is currently engaged in a legal dispute with Elon Musk, who opposes the conversion to a for-profit structure. Musk is attempting to keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit company as he competes in the generative AI market with his own startup, xAI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article reports that European consumers are increasingly avoiding U.S. goods and services due to President Trump's trade war, according to a study by the European Central Bank. The shift appears to be a decisive and potentially long-term trend, with consumers actively seeking alternatives to American products, even if they can afford the higher prices. This change in consumer behavior is fueled by President Trump's tariffs and treatment of America's allies, leading to grassroots boycotts and the development of apps that identify American-made products. Even if trade deals are reached, the newfound wariness of the U.S. may not easily be reversed, indicating a possible long-term structural shift in consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details how Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant flight disruptions due to staffing shortages, runway construction, and bad weather. Air traffic controllers temporarily lost communication with planes, leading to absences and exacerbating existing delays. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation into the problems, blaming mismanagement at the FAA and cuts imposed by the Trump administration. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey attributes the issues to staffing shortages at air traffic control centers, while United Airlines CEO cited equipment failures and controller walk-offs as contributing factors, leaving travelers frustrated and stranded.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, while the national average is over $3. Sources suggest Trump is referencing RBOB gasoline futures, which did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract does not reflect what consumers pay at the pump. RBOB tracks wholesale, unfinished gasoline before taxes, transportation, and other costs are added, making it irrelevant to consumers. Experts emphasize that the RBOB price excludes taxes, tariffs, transportation costs, and credit card fees, meaning it does not accurately reflect what drivers pay at the pump.</p>

UK filmmakers have warned that freelancers in the industry risk being "jobless" if US productions are pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a "knock-out blow". The uncertainty surrounding the specifics of the tariffs is causing concern within the UK film industry, which often collaborates with US firms on major productions.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a plan for a "forceful entry" into Gaza, involving the relocation of Palestinians to the south. This escalation follows stalled cease-fire talks and continued blockades and bombardments of Gaza, which has drawn criticism for endangering hostages and not fundamentally changing the conflict's dynamics. Critics argue that the expanded military campaign will not achieve Israel's goals of destroying Hamas or releasing all hostages, while Israeli officials claim the offensive will increase pressure on Hamas and destroy its infrastructure.
