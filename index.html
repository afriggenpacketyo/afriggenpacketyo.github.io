          <h2>Russian Soldiers Express Skepticism About Peace Talks and Demand Territorial Gains in Ukraine</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 06:20:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article reveals that many Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine are deeply skeptical of diplomatic efforts and peace proposals, viewing them as insufficient. They insist on conquering all four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions claimed by the Kremlin, fearing that any cease-fire short of this would render their sacrifices meaningless. The soldiers voiced bitterness towards Russian officials and civilians, accusing them of benefiting from the war while ignoring frontline hardships. The interviews highlight the domestic challenges Vladimir Putin would face in ending the war on terms that don't meet his maximalist goals, as the hasty annexation of Ukrainian regions may have limited his negotiation options. The soldiers expressed exhaustion with the war, with an estimated million casualties on both sides, and the desire for demobilization as their only realistic chance of returning home.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses a range of current events, including the Supreme Court's decision to extend the ban on the Trump administration's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelans while a lower court re-examines the case. The article also covers intelligence agencies undercutting the White House’s justification for deporting Venezuelan migrants, and the Department of Homeland Security considering participating in a reality TV show where immigrants compete for American citizenship. In addition, Senate Democrats oppose more than $3 billion in proposed weapons sales to Qatar and the U.A.E. due to financial ties to Trump, and several Republicans blocked their party’s megabill due to deficit concerns. A tornado struck St. Louis, a statue of Melania Trump was stolen, and Moody's downgraded the United States’ credit rating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Fox News article discusses President Trump's Middle East tour and its implications for Israel. Despite skipping Israel during his visit, experts argue that Trump advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests, presenting a strategic opportunity for Jerusalem. Trump condemned the October 7 Hamas attacks, called for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warned Iran over its nuclear ambitions. Some Israeli commentators expressed discomfort at Air Force One flying over Israel en route to other countries, but others emphasized Trump's continued support for Israel. Experts suggest Israel should seize this moment to shape events, urging Washington to demand that Qatar stop funding Hamas and address Al Jazeera's incitement. It is also suggested that Israel anchor itself in a regional bloc with the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, who share similar fears of a Muslim Brotherhood resurgence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Guardian reports on a proposal by US House Republicans to impose new fees on immigrants seeking to remain in the United States, which advocates warn will create insurmountable financial barriers. The proposed legislation could require immigrants to pay fees for asylum applications, caring for minors in government custody, and applying for humanitarian parole. Republican lawmakers claim these fees are necessary to offset the costs of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, but experts argue that they could drain immigrants' resources, force them into exploitative work arrangements, or push them to leave the country. The bill allocates significant funds to construct a border wall and increase immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian discusses how US cancer researchers are exploring the use of fecal waste to understand how the microbiome affects cancer treatment. The Mayo Clinic biobank is studying stool samples to personalize medicine by uncovering how the microbiome influences patients' reactions to cancer medications. Researchers hope to identify which drugs patients are most likely to respond to based on their microbiome and genes. The biobank's work is part of broader efforts to understand how the gut microbiome mediates patients' responses to cancer treatment, with experiments involving fecal transplants and other methods. This research comes amid concerns about the Trump administration's proposed cuts to scientific institutions, highlighting the importance of both private and public funding for scientific advancements.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian discusses the Trump administration's efforts to deport international students over their pro-Palestinian speech, which has faced setbacks in court. Federal judges have ordered the release of several students, deeming their detention unconstitutional. However, the fundamental legal question of whether the government can detain and deport noncitizens for their political speech remains unresolved. Despite the court wins, the arrests have prompted widespread anxiety among international students and scholars, contributing to a climate of fear and repression on US campuses. The administration continues to pursue coercive investigations into universities, further chilling free speech.</p>

          <p>This Los Angeles Times article reviews "Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again" by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. The book depicts President Biden as shockingly frail and forgetful, with a ferocious pride blinding him to his limitations, assisted by a protective inner circle. The authors suggest that disturbing signs of Biden’s diminished capacities emerged as early as 2015, but were dismissed. The article discusses concerns about Biden's behavior and the alleged efforts to conceal his condition from the press, public, and top Democrats. The authors conclude there was a conspiracy to conceal Biden’s symptoms, and that his decision to run for reelection was followed by aggressive efforts to hide his cognitive diminishment.</p>

The recommendations for the proposed 2025-26 budget now head to the full council.

          <p>This Los Angeles Times opinion piece argues that the Lakers should prioritize drafting a mature, experienced player who has already navigated the temptations and pressures of fame and money. The article suggests that the NBA's economic shifts, including rookie contracts, eligibility rules, and NIL policies, have made maturity and resilience more valuable qualities in a draft pick. The author proposes that the Lakers should seek a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on his shoulders, rather than focusing solely on potential and athleticism. The article suggests that such a player is more likely to contribute to the team's success and avoid the pitfalls that can derail younger, less experienced players.</p>

The justices sent the case back to a lower court to examine claims that the migrants could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The court's order will remain in place until the appeals court rules and the Supreme Court considers any appeal. The ruling deals a blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the wartime law to pursue deportations.

          <p>This New York Times article reports that the Israeli military has begun mobilizing its forces in preparation to advance farther into Gaza and seize more land. Intense airstrikes have been conducted in Gaza, killing dozens of people. The escalation comes as mediators seek to broker a new truce to halt the war that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel. The United Nations has warned of a growing risk of famine in Gaza after an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid. Hamas is refusing to release the remaining hostages unless Israel agrees to a permanent end to the war and a withdrawal of its forces from Gaza.</p>

Trump has made it clear that he wants to avoid war and reach a negotiated settlement with Iran. However, significant gaps remain between the two sides, with Trump insisting that Iran must halt enrichment of uranium, while Iran maintains its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. The article discusses potential compromises and challenges, including the need for guarantees that the United States will adhere to a new deal. The success of these efforts will test the efficacy of Trump's foreign policy and the future direction of the Republican Party.</p>

A team from Homeland Security Investigations conducted a work-site enforcement action at Abby’s Bakery, arresting undocumented workers. The owners face potential prison terms, loss of their legal status and deportation if they are found guilty of harboring illegal immigrants.</p>
