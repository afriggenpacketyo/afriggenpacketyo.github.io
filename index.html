          <p>Downtown Los Angeles is dealing with a strange crime spree where over a dozen mature trees were destroyed with a chainsaw, costing an estimated $347,000 in damages. A man was apprehended on Earth Day for the bizarre eight-day spree, which saw elm and ficus trees vandalized near City Hall. This incident occurs in a downtown area already facing issues like homelessness, violent crime, and pandemic recovery. The area remains a central location for protests and large gatherings, highlighting its resilience despite ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>BBC Verify investigates claims made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which purports to have saved billions in US government spending. The analysis reveals a lack of evidence to support some of the agency's largest claimed savings, finding accounting errors and overstated figures. The investigation questions the methods used to report savings, particularly concerning cancelled contracts and grants. While Doge claims to be working on transparency, the BBC found discrepancies between claimed savings and actual documented evidence. </p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to the murder of a health insurance executive in Manhattan, a case in which the U.S. attorney general is seeking the death penalty. The judge cautioned the attorney general to avoid politicizing the case to ensure a fair trial.

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, concerning potential failures to fully disclose significant funding received from foreign sources. The investigation focuses on the university's past partnership with China's Tsinghua University and its compliance with Section 117, which mandates the disclosure of foreign gifts and contracts exceeding $250,000. UC Berkeley denies the government's claims and states it has been cooperating with federal inquiries regarding reporting issues. The Department of Education cited reports of UC Berkeley failing to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign government, believed to be China.</p>

While the plan avoids explicit demands for Ukraine to regain all seized territory or join NATO, major obstacles remain, and the Kremlin might reject key provisions.

          <p>Small businesses are requesting relief from new U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, citing the disproportionate impact on their operations. Senator Ed Markey has called for exemptions for smaller enterprises, noting that they lack the financial cushion to absorb rising costs. The Trump administration defends the tariffs as a means to protect domestic manufacturing and foster economic growth. Some small business owners report that the tariffs are already threatening their livelihoods, as they struggle to compete with larger corporations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused UC Berkeley of failing to disclose millions of dollars in foreign funding, initiating an investigation into potential violations of Section 117 of the Higher Education Act. This action follows a similar investigation into Harvard and aligns with the administration's efforts to scrutinize foreign financial ties of top universities. The investigation revives concerns about the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, a partnership between UC Berkeley and China's Tsinghua University. UC Berkeley states it has been cooperating with federal authorities on this issue.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, this article provides an overview of the major militant groups operating in the region, including The Resistance Front (TRF), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Al Badr, and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH). These groups aim to challenge control over Indian-administered regions of Kashmir and, in many cases, merge the region with Pakistan. Some have ties to global jihadi networks and have previously fought alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The militant landscape is fluid, with factions frequently changing allegiances and sharing fighters.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has revoked a Biden administration policy that restricted subpoenas of reportersâ€™ phone records in criminal investigations, raising concerns about press freedom. Bondi argues that federal employees who leak sensitive information are engaging in potentially treasonous conduct. The new policy allows the Justice Department to seek records and compel testimony from journalists to identify and punish sources of improper leaks. Critics fear this move will escalate attacks on the US media landscape.</p>
