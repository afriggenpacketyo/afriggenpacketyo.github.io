          <p>Qualcomm is set to re-enter the data center market with new processors designed to work with Nvidia's GPUs, targeting the growing demand for AI computing power. This move signifies Qualcomm's strategy to diversify beyond smartphones into chips for cars and PCs. The new CPU is custom-designed and based on Arm architecture, stemming from Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. By linking with Nvidia's GPUs and software, Qualcomm aims to compete in the competitive data center CPU market, currently dominated by Intel and AMD, and also sees big cloud computing players like Amazon and Microsoft designing and deploying their own custom CPUs.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, falling short of expectations, indicating continued concerns about domestic consumption. Industrial output exceeded forecasts, suggesting resilience despite U.S. tariffs, but the statistics bureau cautioned about external uncertainties. Fixed-asset investment also saw a slight decrease, and the real estate sector continues to struggle. Despite trade tensions with the U.S., China's exports surged due to increased shipments to Southeast Asia, offsetting declines in U.S.-bound exports. The article notes that the reduction in mutual tariffs would benefit trade for both sides, while cautioning that domestic demand, including consumption, still lacked momentum.</p>

          <p>Moody's downgrade of the United States' credit rating has amplified worries about government debt and the economic impact of President Trump's policies. The downgrade, influenced by concerns over the fiscal deficit and tax cut legislation, led to declines in stock futures and Asian markets. The U.S. dollar weakened, while gold prices rose. The downgrade could further destabilize financial markets by shaking the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, potentially leading to higher premiums for U.S. debt. The NYTimes article notes that the rise in Treasury bond yields reflects broader anxieties about Trump's tariff agenda and its effects on the American economy.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine has claimed that Indiaâ€™s new Prachand combat helicopter would be easily defeated by Chinaâ€™s Z-10 attack helicopter. The Indian Ministry of Defence approved an order for 156 of the helicopters for high-altitude operations along the Himalayan border with China and the Kashmir region with Pakistan. The LCH Prachand, Indiaâ€™s first domestically designed attack helicopter, is designed for air-to-ground attack roles. Its first flight was in 2010, and the first batch was introduced in 2022, with the new order expected between 2028 and 2033.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed widespread child sexual assault in South Africa's illegal mines, with some children recruited for cheap labor and others for sexual exploitation. Miners reported seeing underage miners, some as young as 15, being sexually assaulted by adult miners in exchange for money or protection.

The illegal mining industry, estimated to cost South Africa's economy billions, continues to thrive despite efforts to curb it, leaving vulnerable children at risk. The BBC article mentions that Save the Children South Africa confirms that many of the rescued miners were sexually exploited.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism for stating he does not need to buy rice due to receiving ample amounts from supporters, amid rising rice prices. The comments were made during a fundraising party as the ministry considers measures to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has roughly doubled from the previous year due to a poor harvest. A recent survey indicated public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the price surge. The Kyodo News article mentions that the government has been releasing stockpiled rice to address the issue.</p>

Speaker Mike Johnson said some changes had been agreed to, but specifics were not provided. The bill extends existing income tax cuts and adds new ones, while also proposing increased spending for border security and defense. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.
