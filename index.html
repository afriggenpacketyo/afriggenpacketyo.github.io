          <p>Following his victory in the 200-meter final at the U.S. track and field championships, sprinter Noah Lyles was shoved by rival Kenny Bednarek, who finished second. The incident, caught on video, escalated into a tense verbal exchange on the track and continued during a post-race interview. The confrontation adds another layer to the intense rivalry between the two top American athletes, who are both expected to be strong contenders at the upcoming World Championships in Tokyo. Lyles appeared to demand an apology during the on-track argument.</p>

          <p>China has firmly rejected U.S. demands to cease purchasing oil from Russia and Iran, stating it will protect its national interests despite the threat of a 100% tariff from the Trump administration. The defiance comes amid otherwise optimistic trade negotiations between the two economic powers, highlighting energy security and foreign policy as non-negotiable for Beijing. U.S. officials acknowledged China's firm stance on sovereignty but maintained that a broader trade deal is still possible. Analysts suggest the U.S. tariff threat may be a negotiating tactic.

          <p>In response to record-high infection rates, the UK's National Health Service has begun rolling out a national vaccination program for gonorrhoea, a world-first initiative. The vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, will initially be offered to high-risk groups, primarily gay and bisexual men with multiple partners. Health officials hope the program, which is 30-40% effective, will prevent up to 100,000 cases and help combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of the infection. Sexual health charities have praised the move as a significant advancement for public health.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian American man, Khamis Ayyad, has died from smoke inhalation following a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank village of Silwad. The U.S. State Department confirmed the death and condemned the violence, which reportedly involved settlers setting fire to homes and vehicles. This incident marks the second death of a Palestinian American in the region in three weeks amid escalating violence between settlers and Palestinians.

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, with officials pointing to downward revisions in recent jobs reports as justification. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett claimed the revisions were "hard evidence" of issues, though he provided no proof of the data being "rigged" as Trump alleged. The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn that the move undermines the credibility and independence of the government's crucial economic data.

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have charged a fifth individual in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in June, where two military aircraft were damaged. Muhammad Umer Khalid, 22, faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place.

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old army veteran suspected of killing four people in a shooting at a bar in Anaconda. The victims have been identified as a barmaid and three customers. Authorities describe the suspect as unstable and dangerous, believing he fled into the dense, mountainous terrain nearby after the attack on Friday morning. The suspect was reportedly a regular at the bar and lived next door, making the crime particularly heinous. A reward has been offered for information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent court filing, Trump administration lawyers denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements from White House officials. Senior adviser Stephen Miller had previously stated a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day. However, the Department of Justice filing, part of a lawsuit over unconstitutional immigration sweeps, asserts that no such numerical quota or target has been issued as official policy to ICE. This discrepancy arises as the administration continues to publicly champion its commitment to a large-scale deportation operation.</p>

          <p>More than 3,200 unionized Boeing workers in Missouri and Illinois are set to go on strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, who build fighter jets and other defense systems, argue they deserve a contract that better reflects their skill and dedication. Boeing expressed disappointment, stating its offer included 40% average wage growth and resolved key issues. The company has activated a contingency plan to ensure non-striking employees can continue to support customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, a first for the state. This growth is driven not by rooftop panels but by large-scale projects from utilities like Florida Power & Light, which find solar to be cheaper than natural gas. A state rule that fast-tracks approvals for smaller projects has also accelerated development. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing grid constraints, even as communities like Babcock Ranch prove the model's resilience.
