            <p>In response to increased tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, China has announced retaliatory tariffs of 84% on U.S. goods. This escalation intensifies the trade war between the two economic powerhouses, threatening to disrupt global markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed disappointment in China's unwillingness to negotiate, emphasizing the potential negative consequences for their economy. The trade war has already impacted global equity markets, with major indices experiencing significant declines, indicating investor unease and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
