            <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 7% this week, marking its best performance since 2022, as investors grappled with market volatility triggered by tariff uncertainties. Megacap technology stocks, led by Nvidia's 17% jump, also had a strong week, with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla all experiencing significant gains. The market's rollercoaster ride included a Wednesday rally following a tariff pause announcement, followed by a Thursday reversal as Trump focused on China. This wild week underscores the market's sensitivity to trade policy developments and their potential impact on the technology sector.</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to block the death penalty, arguing it is a "political stunt." U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi had previously ordered federal prosecutors to pursue the death penalty, describing the murder as a premeditated assassination. Mangione is accused of fatally shooting Thompson in December as the CEO entered a Hilton Hotel in Manhattan. The defense contends that seeking the death penalty is politically motivated and intended to advance President Trump's agenda on violent crime.</p>

            <p>An immigration judge in Louisiana has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with the deportation of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil. The judge deemed the government's determination that Khalil poses "adverse foreign policy consequences" to be "facially reasonable." Khalil is being targeted for deportation due to his role in campus protests against Israel, with the government arguing his presence undermines efforts to combat anti-Semitism. Khalil's lawyers claim the government is violating his right to free speech, arguing the executive power to deport someone based on dissent is limitless.</p>

Her decision has opened up what is expected to be a competitive Republican primary in 2026, with potential candidates including the state attorney general and members of Iowa's congressional delegation.

            <p>The UK government is recalling Parliament for an emergency Saturday session to pass legislation aimed at preventing the closure of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. This action follows the Chinese owner's announcement that its blast furnaces are no longer financially sustainable. The legislation would allow the government to order raw materials and direct the company's board and workforce. While not a full nationalization, this move signifies the government's commitment to preserving the UK's steel industry, deemed essential for national security and economic stability.

            <p>An immigration judge in Louisiana has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, can be deported based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his activism is antisemitic and undermines U.S. foreign policy. The judge stated she had no authority to question Rubio's determination. Khalil's attorneys plan to appeal the ruling, arguing it violates his rights. This case highlights the use of a rarely used federal statute from the 1950s, the McCarran-Walter Act, which allows the secretary of state to deport non-citizens deemed a threat to U.S. foreign policy goals.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates have risen above 7% as tariffs impact the bond market, reaching the highest level since mid-February. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 7.1% due to spiking bond yields following President Trump's new tariffs. Consumer sentiment has also declined, with inflation expectations rising to the highest level since 1981. This development occurs during the crucial spring housing market, potentially impacting affordability and demand. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Wells Fargo reported mixed first-quarter earnings, with revenue misses offset by lower expenses and better provisions, leading to a trimmed price target from analysts. Total revenue fell 3.4% year over year to $20.15 billion, missing analysts' expectations. Despite the mixed results, the analyst expressed confidence in the bank's turnaround under CEO Charlie Scharf, citing improvements in investment banking, credit cards, and the auto business. The analyst is waiting on the removal of the asset cap and believes Wells Fargo should be in a relatively better position to weather the storm. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A glitch in U.S. Customs and Border Protection's system is delaying the collection of tariffs on freight shipments, including those from China and nations under the 90-day pause. The entry code used to exempt freight from tariffs is not working, causing confusion and uncertainty for U.S. shippers. Customs is advising importers to file cargo release forms separately and follow up with financial papers later, meaning tariffs are not currently being collected. The glitch raises questions about Customs' ability to handle the new tariff policies and collect revenue effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is dismantling the legacy of progress made in combating HIV, cutting funding and programs for research, treatment, and prevention. This reversal is seen as a vindictive move against the public-health establishment that emerged during the AIDS era. Experts fear that these cuts will lead to a resurgence of HIV infections and undermine the public-health principles that guided the fight against AIDS. Highly effective treatments can decrease the risk that pregnant women living with HIV will pass the virus to their baby to less than 1 percent. Skip drugs for just a few weeks, though, and those rates rise to roughly 30 percent.</p>
