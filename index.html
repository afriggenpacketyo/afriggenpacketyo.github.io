          <p>An inquiry is underway in Australia to investigate the Bondi mass killing, focusing on how Joel Cauchi, a man with a history of mental illness, was able to commit the attack. The inquiry seeks to identify systemic failures that contributed to the tragedy, with families of the victims providing emotional testimonies about their loss and the horror of learning about the event. The focus is on the interactions Cauchi had with police and mental health professionals, scrutinizing whether opportunities to intervene were missed. The coroner aims to provide recommendations to prevent similar events in the future.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, signaling support for the Japanese company's investment in the American producer, while also stating that U.S. Steel would continue to be controlled by the USA.

          <p>Former President Trump touted an agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, claiming it would keep the company in Pittsburgh and under U.S. control, despite previous opposition to the merger. Trump announced plans to double steel import tariffs to 50% and said Nippon would invest $14 billion, creating jobs and modernizing facilities. He emphasized that U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and promised a $5,000 bonus for workers. While hailing the deal, Trump later stated he had not yet seen the final details.</p>
