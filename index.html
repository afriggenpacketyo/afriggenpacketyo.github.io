          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 to 2025 due to an issue where door trim pieces may detach while driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warned that these detached parts could create a road hazard, increasing the risk of a crash for other vehicles. The company, which is unaware of any related accidents or injuries, stated the problem stems from a vehicle assembly issue rather than a parts defect, and dealers will perform inspections and replacements at no cost to owners.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino asserts that despite public perception, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events, citing an average price of $72. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the soaring post-pandemic demand for live events and noted that touring has become the primary revenue source for artists, with some tours resembling a "Super Bowl" production every night. He also mentioned that technological advancements, such as AI-driven ticketing, could improve the purchasing experience for consumers in the future.</p>

          <p>The startup Tensor is developing what it calls the world's first "personal robocar," a luxury electric vehicle designed for consumer ownership with Level 4 autonomy. The vehicle aims to allow drivers to take their eyes off the road, featuring a steering wheel that can fold away to create a mobile lounge or office space. Packed with numerous sensors like cameras, lidars, and radars, the car's AI is designed to mimic human driving decisions without constant cloud support, enhancing privacy. The company plans to begin selling the vehicle, manufactured in partnership with VinFast, by 2026.</p>

The company priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, raising $800 million, but the stock price dropped after an initial opening pop. This long-awaited IPO follows previous delays due to market volatility and comes amid a resurgence in the live events market, which has boosted the company's revenues. StubHub reported 10% revenue growth in the first quarter but also saw its net loss widen compared to the previous year.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Enacts First Interest Rate Cut of the Year Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:57:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the first cut this year in an effort to support a slowing labor market. The move comes after a sustained pressure campaign from President Donald Trump, though the size of the cut was smaller than he had demanded. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the challenge of addressing both rising unemployment risks and a recent inflation uptick, stating the central bank remains committed to its independence. The decision was made amidst ongoing controversy surrounding Trump's attempts to reshape the Fed's board of governors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's Waymo is partnering with Lyft to introduce its autonomous ride-hailing service to Nashville, Tennessee, next year, causing Lyft's stock to climb over 10%. Under the agreement, Lyft will manage the fleet's operations, including vehicle maintenance and depot management. While riders will initially book through the Waymo app, the robotaxis will eventually be integrated into the Lyft platform. This marks Waymo's first commercial deal with Lyft and expands its significant presence in the U.S. robotaxi market, where it competes with services from Tesla and Amazon's Zoox.</p>

Researchers estimate that up to 35,000 children could be in this system, which spans from the Black Sea to Siberia. The findings have prompted alarm among European officials and reinforce Ukraine's demand for the children's return as part of any peace agreement.</p>

          <p>California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii have formed a regional alliance to issue their own joint vaccine recommendations, breaking from the federal government's guidance. The move comes as California's governor signed a law empowering the state to create its own immunization schedules based on local health experts. This effort is a direct response to what the states describe as a politicized U.S. Centers for Disease Control under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The alliance aims to provide clear, science-based vaccine guidance to protect families amid growing public uncertainty over federal health policies.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz described how North Korean IT professionals are using generative AI to create fake resumes and online profiles to infiltrate companies covertly. Once hired remotely, these operatives gain access to a company's network, at which point Kurtz says it is "game over." He emphasized that AI is "democratizing destruction" by making it easier for adversaries to launch sophisticated attacks, and that companies need AI-powered defenses to combat these emerging threats. The cybersecurity firm recently announced the acquisition of Pangea, a startup focused on securing the autonomous AI agents that represent the next wave of cyber defense.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Lithuania have announced the disruption of a Russian-led plot to carry out bomb attacks across Europe using mail parcels. The plan involved concealing homemade incendiary devices containing thermite inside items like massage cushions, which were then shipped via carriers such as DHL and DPD. Several parcels exploded at facilities in Germany, Poland, and the UK, while others were intercepted. An international investigation involving multiple countries led to the identification of suspects with ties to Russian military intelligence, who were reportedly recruited via Telegram and offered payment in cryptocurrency.</p>

Local leaders from the LDS Church attended the opening ceremony, highlighting interfaith support in the community.

          <p>Despite Inter Miami's success in the regular season, the club's ultimate objective is to win the MLS Cup, the league's championship title.

The team has already seen massive increases in broadcast subscriptions and sponsorship revenue since Messi's arrival. While other titles like the Supporters' Shield are prestigious, the MLS Cup holds the most significance for fans and would capstone the Messi era in Miami, especially as the club prepares to open a new stadium next year.</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral diabetes pill, orforglipron, proved superior to Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus, in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The highest dose of Eli Lilly's drug reduced hemoglobin A1c levels by 2.2% and helped patients lose an average of 9.2% of their body weight over 52 weeks. The results position orforglipron as a strong future competitor in the lucrative market for GLP-1 drugs, offering a needle-free alternative without dietary restrictions. Eli Lilly expects to apply for regulatory approval for the drug in 2026.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama stated that the U.S. is at an "inflection point" regarding political violence following the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Speaking in Pennsylvania, Obama condemned the violence but criticized President Donald Trump's response, arguing that Trump rushed to "identify an enemy" and deepen political divisions rather than unite the country. He contrasted this with his own approach after the 2015 Charleston church shooting, emphasizing a president's role is to remind citizens of their shared bonds. The White House responded by calling Obama the "architect of modern political division."</p>
