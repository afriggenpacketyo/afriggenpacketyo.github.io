          <h2>UK Government to Extend Bereavement Leave for Miscarriage at Any Stage of Pregnancy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 02:17:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill, extending the right to bereavement leave for parents who experience a miscarriage at any point during a pregnancy. This marks a significant change from the current law, which only grants leave for pregnancy loss occurring after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that the new policy ensures individuals can take time off to grieve without resorting to sick leave, which many feel is inappropriate for such a loss. The move has been praised by advocates and MPs, who see it as the law finally catching up to the reality that a miscarriage is a form of bereavement, not an illness.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called upon BRICS member nations to take collective action and uphold independence in response to potential new tariffs from the United States. Speaking at a summit, Li emphasized the need for the bloc to build consensus and stand firm in preserving global peace and stability through the peaceful settlement of disputes. His remarks are widely interpreted as a direct challenge to the Western-led global order and a strategic push for improved global governance. This call to action comes as a temporary tariff truce between the US and China is set to expire, raising concerns about escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A highly advanced British F-35B fighter jet has been grounded at an airport in Kerala, India, for over three weeks after experiencing a technical snag during a sortie. The aircraft was forced to divert due to bad weather and has since been unable to return to the HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier. A specialized 14-member engineering team from the UK has now arrived with specialist equipment to assess and repair the $110 million stealth jet. The prolonged stay has generated significant public curiosity and online humor in India, with the aircraft being guarded around the clock by Royal Air Force personnel.</p>

          <p>The United States has removed a ban on selling American jet engine components and technology to Chinese buyers, a move expected to significantly aid China's aviation ambitions. This decision allows the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to import critical parts for its homegrown C919 narrowbody aircraft, enabling it to fulfill hundreds of existing orders. While this development is a positive step for bilateral trade and Comac's European market goals, analysts note that previous US restrictions have likely strengthened China's resolve to accelerate the development of its own indigenous engine technology to reduce future reliance on foreign suppliers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The threat was made via a post on Truth Social and did not specify which policies he considered anti-American, but it followed a BRICS joint statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. This move escalates trade tensions and introduces a new layer of geopolitical pressure, directly targeting the bloc of developing nations that seeks to challenge the Western-dominated global economic order. The announcement coincides with the impending expiration of a 90-day pause on previously announced US tariffs.</p>

The owners face charges of negligence and keeping a wild animal without a proper license within city limits, which is illegal. The practice of keeping big cats as status symbols is prevalent in Pakistan, but this event has prompted authorities in the Punjab province to launch a crackdown on illegal wildlife possession, leading to more arrests and the recovery of other lions.</p>

Trump asserted that a third party only creates "disruption and chaos" and also took aim at Musk's previous support for electric vehicle mandates, which the president's new legislation effectively ended by eliminating tax credits for EV buyers.</p>

After a nine-week trial that captivated the nation, the jury concluded that Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests during a lunch at her home in 2023. The prosecution argued she lured her victims to the meal and then attempted to cover up her actions by disposing of evidence and lying to police. While prosecutors did not offer a specific motive, they highlighted strained family relations, and Patterson now faces a potential life sentence for the murders and one count of attempted murder.</p>

However, significant obstacles remain, particularly Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war, which Israel has consistently rejected. The recent Israeli-US offensive against Iran is seen by some analysts as having created more favorable conditions for a deal, potentially giving Netanyahu more leverage to agree to terms over objections from his far-right coalition partners.</p>

While this shift has some benefits, such as a drop in teenage births, economists worry about the long-term consequences, including depopulation, labor force shortages, and the sustainability of social safety nets like Social Security.

          <p>An analysis argues that the increasing financialization of housing across Europe has created a severe crisis, fueling political disenfranchisement and inequality. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have treated housing as a lucrative asset class, driving up prices and rents while pushing home ownership out of reach for many. This shift has been enabled by government policies that privatized public housing and liberalized mortgage credit, empowering investors at the expense of residents. The article contends that this system, which profits from housing shortages, is a primary cause of suffering and is becoming a central issue in European politics.</p>

The therapy, detailed in Nature Medicine, delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, correcting a mutation that prevents the transmission of sound signals to the brain. Researchers reported that hearing improved rapidly within a month, with younger children showing the best response; one seven-year-old girl regained almost full hearing. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope for future therapies for other common forms of genetic deafness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on its trading partners to finalize new trade deals by a Wednesday deadline, warning that higher tariffs could be implemented on August 1 for those who do not comply. The White House plans to send letters to dozens of countries, particularly those with which the U.S. has a significant trade deficit. Additionally, President Trump announced a new policy to charge an extra 10% tariff on any country aligning with the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This strategy creates further uncertainty in the global economy as nations scramble to negotiate deals to avoid the steep import taxes.</p>

          <p>Campaigners in the UK are calling on the government not to abolish Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities. In a letter to The Guardian, they warn that removing these legally binding protections could deny thousands of children vital support or even access to education altogether. The government has not ruled out scrapping the plans as part of an overhaul of the special needs system, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson calling it a "complex and sensitive area." This has drawn criticism from the opposition, who accuse the government of broken promises regarding the support for vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>A top police official in South Africa has accused the country's police minister, Senzo Mchunu, and other senior officers of interfering in investigations into political assassinations to protect connected individuals. The allegations, made by KwaZulu-Natal's provincial commissioner, have been described by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a matter of "grave national security concern." The accusations have sparked outrage across the political spectrum, with calls for an urgent parliamentary debate and an independent inquiry. This scandal erupts amid a documented rise in targeted political killings in South Africa, raising serious questions about the integrity of the nation's law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched air strikes on three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, stating the attacks were a response to repeated Houthi aggression. One of the targets was the commercial ship Galaxy Leader, which Israel claims the rebel group was using for maritime surveillance after hijacking it in 2023. The Iran-backed Houthis have been launching missiles at Israel and attacking Red Sea shipping in solidarity with Palestinians since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Following the Israeli strikes, the Houthis reported that their air defenses confronted the attack with surface-to-air missiles.</p>

          <p>A research team from Fuzhou University in China has developed a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light more rapidly than the human visual system. The new system is also capable of memorizing light settings to improve its adaptation speed for future encounters with similar conditions. This breakthrough technology aims to overcome issues present in current vision systems by providing faster computation while consuming less energy. The innovation mimics and enhances the adaptive capabilities of the human retina, optic nerve, and brain's visual cortex, potentially leading to advancements in machine vision and imaging.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, author Jessie Cole reflects on her childhood relationship with her younger brother, who rarely spoke, and how she often acted as his translator to the outside world. After their family was struck by grief and trauma, her brother became almost mute but found a powerful new voice through playing the guitar. Cole describes how his instrumental music became a rich language, expressing the joy, sadness, and history that words could not capture. She writes about learning to be quiet and listen, realizing that in his melodies, he was sharing his own unique story and inner world with her.</p>

          <h2>Questions Raised Over Adequacy of Warnings Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of the devastating Texas floods that have killed nearly 80 people, questions are emerging about whether officials provided adequate warnings to residents. Local officials in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, stated they had no reason to expect a flood of such magnitude, describing it as a "water wall of almost 30ft high." Challenges such as lack of cell coverage in some areas and the expense of a county-wide warning system have been cited as contributing factors. While the National Weather Service defended its forecasts and warnings, the tragedy has highlighted potential systemic issues and the public's desensitization to frequent weather alerts.</p>
