        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official data reveals that the UK's inflation rate has climbed to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over a year, primarily driven by increased household bills. Economists had anticipated a rise to 3.3%, but the actual figure exceeded expectations, surpassing the Bank of England's 2% target. The surge in water, gas, and electricity prices on April 1, along with a rise in employer National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage, contributed to the inflationary pressure. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment, while Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride voiced concerns for families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' a sweeping legislative package encompassing tax cuts, increased military spending, and adjustments to social programs. Despite Trump's urging, divisions within the party persist, with conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts and moderates advocating for state and local tax deduction increases. Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to reconcile these factions, but the bill's fate remains uncertain.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased as investors grew concerned that a new tax bill could worsen the country's deficit, exacerbated by a recent Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. The 30-year Treasury bond yield surpassed 5%, while the 10-year yield hit 4.5%. Investors are closely monitoring budget bill discussions, with Republicans pushing for larger state and local tax deductions, potentially increasing the government's deficit.

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration maintain custody of immigrants deported to South Sudan, amid concerns that their removal may be unlawful. The ruling comes after lawyers argued that the deportations violated a court order ensuring migrants have a 'meaningful opportunity' to prove that deportation to a third country would be unsafe. South Sudan, founded in 2011, faces escalating armed conflict, mass displacement, and severe food insecurity. Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously announced visa revocations for South Sudanese passport holders due to the government's failure to accept repatriated citizens.</p>

          <p>Despite cultivating ties with right-wing populist leaders globally, President Trump's recent foreign policy actions have left some of his allies disappointed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, despite years of close relations with Trump, was reportedly dismayed by Trump's direct negotiations with Hamas and Iran. Similarly, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's supporters were angered by Trump's remarks on the India-Pakistan ceasefire. Even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n has appeared frustrated, maintaining close economic ties with China despite Trump's pressure. This indicates that political affinity may not be the primary driver of Trump's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has affirmed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners seeking to restrict public access. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to open-air recreation. Judges stated that this right naturally includes camping. The decision is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England. Dartmoor National Park covers a 368-square-mile area and is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights on private land in England.</p>

          <p>UK health officials have reported the first detection of West Nile virus in mosquitoes in the UK. Fragments of the virus were found in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes. While there have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date, the virus is endemic in several regions across the world. The UK Health Security Agency said that the risk to the general public is 'very low'. Experts recommend getting rid of standing water sources and using mosquito repellent to avoid mosquito bites.</p>

          <p>A Vietnamese court has sentenced 23 officials and business people to prison for illegally exploiting and exporting rare earth minerals. The case involved the unlawful granting of a mining license to Thai Duong Company for rare earth exploitation in Yen Bai province. The defendants sold rare earths and iron ore from the mine for nearly $30 million, with much of it going to China. The U.S. Geological Survey recently revised down its estimate of Vietnam's rare earth reserves, impacting the country's ambitions to compete with Beijing in the high-tech sector.</p>

Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, warned that volatility in the Treasury market could add to uncertainty. Investors are concerned that the administration's tax bill will add to the federal deficit, requiring more borrowing and potentially leading to higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's announced plan to cap drug prices by pegging them to lower prices in other developed countries has been revealed to be largely symbolic. The executive order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify a 'price target' and asks pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily comply, lacking any enforcement mechanism. Experts view the plan as unlikely to succeed without congressional legislation and express concerns about the administration's approach to drug innovation. A more viable path to lower drug costs would be to expand the federal government's ability to negotiate drug prices. (not investment advice)</p>
