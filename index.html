          <p>Opposition activists from Kenya allege they were detained and tortured in Tanzania, raising concerns about cross-border human rights solidarity. Kenyan economist James Shikwati suggests the actions stem from a fear of protests similar to those in Kenya. The situation highlights tensions within the East African Community, particularly regarding political opposition. The Tanzanian government denies the accusations of torture and maintains that the activists violated law and order.</p>

Protesters criticized the Italian government's perceived silence on the conflict and called for a clear stance against the Israeli offensive. The march attracted a diverse crowd, including families, who voiced concerns about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Italy's Prime Minister was recently urged to publicly condemn Netanyahuâ€™s offensive, but her criticism was considered insufficient by many.</p>
