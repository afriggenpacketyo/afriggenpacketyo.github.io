          <p>XRP cryptocurrency experienced a significant price surge after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC is dropping its lawsuit against the company.  This follows a partial victory for Ripple in 2023, where XRP was deemed not a security when sold to retail investors. The development is seen as positive for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5%, a decision largely anticipated by market analysts. While rate cuts are expected later in 2025, borrowing costs will remain elevated, impacting consumer spending.  Higher rates, however, do benefit savers through increased interest on savings accounts.</p>
