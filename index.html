          <p>The United Kingdom has been temporarily exempted from Donald Trump's executive order that doubles tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%. While the order raises import taxes for US-based firms buying from other countries, the levy remains at 25% for the UK due to the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal signed last month. However, this agreement is yet to fully come into force, meaning UK steel exporters will still face tariffs until it does, and could face the higher amount if the pact falters. The UK government has stated its commitment to protecting British business and jobs and will continue to work with the US to fully implement the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's number of births fell below 700,000 for the first time in 2024, marking a 5.7% decrease from the previous year and highlighting a continued trend of delayed marriages and childbirths. The country's total fertility rate also declined to a record low of 1.15, exacerbating concerns about Japan's aging population and shrinking workforce. While the number of marriages saw a slight increase, the number of deaths reached a postwar high, resulting in a record natural decrease in population. This accelerated decline is occurring 15 years faster than government projections, underscoring the urgency of addressing the country's demographic challenges.</p>

Her lawyers at Public Counsel expressed gratitude to USCIS for acting swiftly to ensure she can continue receiving her specialized IV treatments, which can only be administered in the United States, according to the equipment manufacturer.

          <p>Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50% in an effort to secure the future of the American steel industry. Critics of the move argue that these protections could negatively impact steel producers outside the US, spark retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American users of the metals. The UK has been granted a temporary carve-out from the measures, leaving duties on its steel and aluminum at 25%, reflecting ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists predict that the US economy could also face damage as prices rise as a result of the new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill, known as the "Big Beautiful Bill," has passed the House but faces opposition in the Senate from Republicans seeking further spending cuts. Musk's comments were echoed by Bernie Sanders, who also criticized the bill for providing tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while cutting food aid for the impoverished.

          <p>Police have launched an investigation into the deaths of patients following heart operations at Castle Hill Hospital, an NHS hospital, after concerns were raised about the care provided. Documents suggest that patients suffered avoidable harm during TAVI procedures, and death certificates failed to disclose the procedure's contribution to their deaths. The hospital's TAVI mortality rate was reportedly three times higher than the UK average, and staff concerns led to multiple reviews, none of which were made public to the patients' families. One case involved an 87-year-old woman whose operation went wrong due to the use of an inappropriate access site, resulting in significant complications and her subsequent death.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's recent drone attack on military airfields and critical assets deep inside Russia has highlighted the vulnerability of even the most advanced militaries to small, inexpensive drones. The mission, dubbed Operation Spider's Web, destroyed strategic bombers and demonstrated how swarms of off-the-shelf drones can evade ground defenses and inflict serious damage. This attack serves as a reminder that military bases, ports, and command headquarters worldwide are at risk, and the innovative use of inexpensive technology will likely inspire similar asymmetric attacks in the future.</p>

The move comes amidst increasing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind long-established cross-shareholding ties, with Japan's Financial Services Agency advocating for a reduction in such arrangements.

Critics argue that excluding this defining issue of our time goes against the nation's commitment to freedom of expression and democratic participation. The governing parties justified the ban by claiming the issue was too explosive for classroom deliberations, but critics suggest that the real reason is that politicians are projecting their own failures onto Danish pupils. The government's reluctance to address the issue exposes a flaw in its current order, where it supports human rights in Ukraine but not in Palestine.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team has made the strategic decision not to call her to the witness stand in her second murder trial, a gamble that could significantly impact the outcome of the case. While the prosecution played damaging interview clips in her second murder trial, the defense team fears that cross-examination could open the door to days of tense questioning from the state. Legal experts note that keeping Read off the stand prevents her from providing her own explanations for potentially damaging statements, but also avoids the risk of her appearing defensive or negatively impacting the jury's perception of her personality. The jury's verdict will reveal whether the defense's silence was a calculated success or a missed opportunity.</p>

However, experts in the US and Canada dispute this claim, pointing to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a near-identical orbit in 2011.</p>

          <p>The US has implemented doubled tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports, raising them to 50% despite criticism from key trading partners. Donald Trump asserts this measure aims to revitalize the American industry and counter low-priced imports. The increase applies to all trading partners except Britain, which maintains a 25% rate due to a preliminary trade agreement with the US. Canada and Mexico, major steel exporters to the US, are expected to be significantly affected by the higher tariffs, with both countries engaged in negotiations to have the tariffs removed.

          <p>Australia's economy grew less than expected in the first quarter of the year, expanding 1.3% year-on-year, which is lower than the estimated 1.5% growth. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports. Extreme weather events also negatively impacted domestic final demand and exports, particularly in mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia previously cut rates to 3.85% in May to bolster growth amid rising global trade risks. (not investment advice)</p>
