          <p>The Tall Ships Races have commenced in Aberdeen, Scotland, an event expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors and be the largest of its kind in the country this year. Dozens of historic vessels from across the globe are participating in the four-day festival, which features musical performances by bands like Deacon Blue and Kaiser Chiefs. Organizers aim to create a "party city" atmosphere, though a Met Office weather warning for heavy rain poses a potential challenge. The event, Europe's largest free family festival, celebrates international friendship and provides sailing training for young people before the fleet departs for Norway.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 04:11:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovenia's parliament has passed a law legalizing medically assisted suicide, making it the first country in Eastern Europe to do so. The legislation, approved with a 50-34 vote, follows a referendum where 55% of voters supported the right to end-of-life autonomy. The law applies to mentally competent, terminally ill adults who are suffering unbearably and have exhausted all treatment options, excluding those with only mental illnesses. While hailed as a landmark decision for compassion, implementation is pending as detailed procedures are finalized, and a civil rights group has pledged to challenge the measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has indicated it will not offer compensation to thousands of Afghans whose personal details were leaked in February 2022 but who were not evacuated to Britain. The MoD stated it would "robustly defend" against legal claims, citing an independent review that found it "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked spreadsheet. This decision comes after a super-injunction on publicizing the leak was lifted. Over 1,000 affected Afghans are preparing a lawsuit, while those with family members on the list express deep concern for their safety under Taliban rule.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being celebrated as a significant moment for South Asian and Muslim communities. His campaign, built on a platform of affordability and Palestinian rights, mobilized a diverse coalition of voters, challenging traditional notions of who can represent New York. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise reflects a broader shift within the Democratic base, where issues like the Gaza conflict and economic justice are top priorities. Supporters see his success not just as an identity victory but as a sign of growing political power for working-class and immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has described media reports about the cause of the fatal Air India Boeing Dreamliner crash as speculative and premature. The statement follows the release of a preliminary report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which noted a conversation about engine fuel cutoff switches on the cockpit voice recorder. This led to widespread media speculation about pilot error or intentional action, which the AAIB and Indian officials have condemned as irresponsible.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from injury, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing was a positive step, showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective use of his curveball and sinker. The right-hander has been working on simplifying his mental approach to stay healthy and dependable, a crucial factor for the Dodgers' rotation. His solid performance provides hope that he can become a key contributor for the team in the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China next week. The hearing will focus on countering what is described as China's "economic coercion against democracies." Morrison's government faced significant trade pressure from Beijing, including tariffs on key Australian commodities, after calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 in 2020. His testimony comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, concludes a visit to China aimed at warming diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries, highlighting a shift in approach.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which passed with strong bipartisan support, is a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clear rules to legitimize the technology for payments and finance. Proponents argue the law will bolster the dollar's global status and increase demand for U.S. Treasuries. Critics, however, express concern that the law lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, can sometimes awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings, observed in mice, help explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after their initial tumor has been successfully treated. The research team also identified that combining specific drugs with chemotherapy could inhibit this process. A clinical trial based on these findings is already underway with breast cancer patients, aiming to mitigate this detrimental side effect.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew. The restrictions were imposed amid fears he might flee the country while facing trial for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn the 2023 election results. The order also bans him from social media and from communicating with his son and foreign diplomats. The decision follows a raid on his home and comes amidst rising tensions with the U.S., where President Trump has threatened tariffs on Brazilian goods to pressure authorities.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is suing The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, for at least $10 billion in damages over an article detailing his relationship with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit claims defamation regarding a report about a sexually suggestive birthday letter Trump allegedly sent to Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter. The newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones, has stated it stands by its reporting. The legal action comes as the Trump administration faces pressure to be more transparent about the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the complete elimination of its scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), a move expected to impact over 1,500 employees. The agency stated the closure would result in $748.8 million in savings and is part of a broader reduction in force that has cut the EPA's staff by 22%. Critics, including a former EPA science administrator, argue the cuts dismantle a world-renowned research organization and will leave the public more vulnerable to pollution. The ORD conducts critical research on environmental pollutants and public health risks.</p>

          <p>China's disciplinary authorities are highlighting a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City" project, intended as a major health tourism hub, has been condemned as a "severe waste of resources" after being left largely abandoned due to a broken capital chain and poor decisions. Originally planned with a 1.65 billion yuan investment, the project saw only a fraction of that spent, leaving multiple buildings idle. The case is being used as a warning to other local officials against pursuing unrealistic and poorly planned development projects.</p>

          <p>Scientists at China's Army Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, a world-first, is limited by the amount of power it can handle before its metal components liquefy, capping projectile weight. The new design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which the researchers claim would increase bore pressure enough to fire a 30kg projectile at Mach 7. This advancement aims to overcome the current weapon's power limitations, making it more effective for military applications and addressing a key technological hurdle.</p>
