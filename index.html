          <p>The FDA is set to review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, following a request from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This review comes amid concerns, particularly from Republican Senator Josh Hawley, about the drug's safety, although experts like Dr. CÃ©line Gounder argue that these concerns are often misguided and based on flawed reports. Mifepristone was initially approved in 2000 after extensive review and has been used by over 5 million patients since then, with medication abortions accounting for more than half of all abortions in the U.S. healthcare system in 2023. Despite previous Supreme Court rulings preserving access to the drug, restrictions exist in 28 states, highlighting ongoing debates about its availability. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing travel bans and restrictions on several countries, citing national security risks. The ban fully restricts entry from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and Iran, while partially restricting entry from seven others, such as Burundi, Cuba, and Venezuela. The White House justifies the action by pointing to inadequate vetting processes, high visa overstay rates, or failures to share identity and threat information from the targeted countries. Exceptions will be made for lawful permanent residents, adoptions, dual nationals, and those traveling on diplomatic, U.N., or NATO visas, among others. </p>

          <p>Munchkin, a popular baby products company, is facing significant challenges due to increased tariffs on steel and aluminum, impacting the cost of several of its products. The company's CEO, Steven Dunn, notes that the tariffs, which have doubled to 50%, along with existing tariffs on Chinese imports, are making products like baby spoons unaffordable. These tariffs are affecting almost all of Munchkin's 500-plus products, most of which are made in China, and have already led to layoffs at the company. Dunn argues that the tariffs are hurting parents and small to medium-sized businesses, as manufacturing in the U.S. is currently not a feasible alternative. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Colorado attack. This order came after the family was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), with the White House indicating they could be deported quickly. Judge Gordon Gallagher cited the potential for irreparable harm if the deportation occurred without due process. Soliman's family, who are Egyptian citizens, entered the U.S. in 2022 and were allowed to remain until February 2023, with Soliman applying for asylum on their behalf. </p>

Denmark's policies include processing asylum seekers outside the continent, tightening rules on family reunions, and making refugees' stays temporary. While asylum claims are down, critics argue these policies damage Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law and alienate citizens with migrant backgrounds. </p>
