        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers fell after the European Commission announced plans to increase steel tariffs to 50% and reduce import quotas by 47%. The proposal, intended to protect the EU's domestic steel industry, has sparked concern within the automotive sector about rising input costs and inflation. Industry groups like the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association argue the measures are excessive and threaten the competitiveness of carmakers, who source about 90% of their steel from within the EU. The news contributed to a significant drop in shares for companies like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors have concluded that their case against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly making false statements to Congress is likely untenable, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The central witness, law professor Daniel Richman, reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information anonymously and, in fact, advised against it on multiple occasions. This testimony undermines the core allegation that Comey lied to Congress about authorizing anonymous media sources. Internal memos suggest prosecutors recognized "insurmountable problems" with the case before a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney proceeded with the indictment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Animal Welfare Institute indicates that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has increasingly issued warnings instead of meaningful penalties for violations of the Animal Welfare Act over the last five years. Despite documented cases of severe neglect at facilities like dog breeding operations and primate research labs, businesses often face no significant consequences. Critics attribute the weak enforcement to understaffing at the USDA, legal challenges, and a tendency to reduce fines, which many violators treat as a mere cost of doing business. The report suggests this trend has worsened, undermining a law that already provides limited protection for animals.</p>

The deal, announced Wednesday, will leverage Verizon's 850 MHz spectrum to offer connectivity in areas where traditional terrestrial networks are unavailable. This partnership expands on a previous collaboration and is set to begin next year, following successful tests of AST's space-based network.

          <p>Despite a slight drop in interest rates, overall mortgage application volume fell last week, with demand for refinancing decreasing by 8%. However, a growing number of borrowers are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial interest rates, with the ARM share of applications rising to 9.5%. These loans are considered riskier because their rates can increase significantly after the initial fixed period expires. The trend indicates that homebuyers and refinancers are actively seeking ways to reduce their monthly payments in a high-cost housing market, even if it involves taking on more long-term financial uncertainty.

          <p>Financial experts are emphasizing the benefits of qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) as a highly effective tax-saving strategy for retirees aged 70½ and older. This move allows for a direct, tax-free transfer of up to $108,000 in 2025 from a traditional IRA to an eligible charity. While not a deduction, the amount is excluded from the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI), which can help lower Medicare premiums and prevent phaseouts of other tax breaks. Additionally, QCDs can be used to satisfy annual required minimum distributions (RMDs), providing a way for philanthropic retirees to give to charity while managing their tax burden.

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, though weakening, continues to churn off Mexico's Pacific coast as a powerful Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm is moving parallel to the coast of Baja California Sur, prompting a tropical storm watch for the peninsula from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. While Priscilla is expected to remain offshore and continue weakening, it is generating large, life-threatening swells, surf, and rip currents for coastal areas of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated the new Navi Mumbai International Airport, a major infrastructure project built by the Adani Group for an estimated $2.2 billion. The airport is expected to begin operations in December and will serve as a second international hub for the financial capital, easing congestion at the city's existing busy airport. With an initial capacity of 20 million passengers annually, the project is a key part of India's push to modernize its aviation network to support a fast-growing economy. The country's airport count has more than doubled in the last decade.</p>

          <p>A trend known as "locking in" has gained popularity among Gen Z on social media, describing a period of intense focus on personal goals, often related to fitness, finance, or habit-building. The movement is seen as a reaction to the distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing the generation, including the rise of AI and a competitive job market. While it shares roots with millennial hustle culture, "locking in" is more focused on self-improvement than on climbing a corporate ladder. Critics note the performative aspect of the trend and question whether this constant drive for productivity leaves room for unstructured fun.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has voted in favor of a ban that would prevent plant-based food products from being marketed with names like "burger," "sausage," or "schnitzel." Proponents from the center-right European People's Party argued that using these terms for non-meat items is misleading to consumers and harms traditional farmers. The decision has drawn criticism from Green party members, consumer protection organizations, and major supermarkets, who contend that consumers are not confused by such labels and that the move stifles innovation in the growing plant-based market. The final decision on the ban will now rest with the heads of EU member states.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived at an Army Reserve Training Center near Chicago, a deployment authorized by President Trump that has been strongly condemned by Illinois officials. Governor JB Pritzker labeled the move an authoritarian power grab and vowed to resist what he called the use of military troops against American communities. The deployment follows weeks of heightened immigration enforcement and protests in the Chicago area. Chicago's mayor accused the Trump administration of intentionally fomenting chaos, describing the situation as one of the most dangerous times in the nation's history.</p>

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa acknowledged that the behavior of some U.S. fans at the recent Ryder Cup "crossed the line," but he denied that his own pre-tournament comments were to blame. Morikawa had previously said he hoped for "absolute chaos," which he now clarifies was a call for high energy and national pride, not rudeness toward European players. During the event at Bethpage, European team members faced verbal abuse, and Rory McIlroy's wife had beer thrown at her. Morikawa stated that while fans can say what they want, a line needs to be drawn between appropriate support and unacceptable conduct.</p>

          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. This requirement became critical following a legal precedent set in another spy case. Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements from the government that met this new, higher legal threshold, forcing them to drop the charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry. The failure has prompted criticism and questions about the government's official stance on China.</p>

Drawing parallels to historical figures like Isaac Newton and the "deaf gain" movement, the article posits that neurodivergence contributes valuable perspectives to society. The author concludes that conversations about "curing" autism are debates about whether people like them should exist, asserting that difference is not a defect.</p>
