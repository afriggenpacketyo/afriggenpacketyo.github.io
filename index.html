          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is temporarily suspending shipments of UK-made vehicles to the United States in response to the imposition of tariffs by Donald Trump. The company is assessing strategies to mitigate the financial impact of the 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks. This pause raises concerns about the broader implications for Britain's car industry, which relies heavily on exports to the US, the second biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union. Keir Starmer is consulting with foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Friday in which the leaders agreed that an all-out trade war would be “extremely damaging”.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's tariff announcement has caused confusion among global leaders and prompted financial markets to consider the implications of a significant shift in America's international trade policy. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed the potential consequences of the tariffs, with some arguing that trade has not benefited blue-collar workers as promised. While adjustments to trade policy might be necessary, Trump's tariffs are described as "shambolic" and unpredictable.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted a large-scale missile defense test in the Gobi Desert, firing as many as 16 ballistic missiles at a single target. The test aimed to assess a new radar system's ability to counter saturation attacks. The unprecedented scale of the test signals China's growing confidence in its military capabilities. The system successfully detected and tracked all missiles, achieving critical metrics for neutralizing advanced threats.</p>

          <p>Inactive investors who adopt a "buy and hold" strategy often achieve better investment returns than active traders. Active trading typically incurs higher costs and taxes and is often driven by impulsive, emotional decision-making. Data shows that the average stock investor's return lagged the S&P 500 stock index by 5.5 percentage points in 2023. Market moves can trigger a fight-or-flight response, leading to behavioral mistakes that can result in major losses. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3Ci&#x3E(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E</p>
