        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania, coinciding with ongoing discussions about a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Trump described the deal as a "partnership" that would keep U.S. Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment by Nippon. However, details remain scarce despite Trump's assurances that the deal will be controlled by the USA, with concerns raised about national security and supply chains. Senator Dave McCormick indicated the U.S. government would have a "golden share" to ensure production levels are maintained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams was awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages following a libel case against the BBC over a 2016 story alleging his involvement in the murder of Denis Donaldson. Adams, who denies any involvement, stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable, while the Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder. The BBC expressed disappointment, arguing they had defended their journalism, while Adams' solicitor criticized the BBC for leaving the false allegation online for nine years. The trial included testimony from Adams and a BBC reporter, with the jury finding the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court ruling against President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative trade policy options. While the tariffs remain in place due to a temporary halt on the ruling, the administration is considering using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. These options offer varying degrees of authority, with some requiring investigations or being limited to specific sectors or countries. The White House maintains its commitment to addressing national emergencies and trade deficits through available legal authorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for identifying and separating transgender troops, instructing personnel to address them according to their medical assignment at birth rather than their preferred pronoun. The guidance outlines criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria, including past requests for grooming standard exemptions or initiation of medical treatment. This policy has been criticized as being worse than the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, overtly targeting transgender service members, with Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer, facing separation. The Army spokesman stated that pronoun usage must reflect biological sex and that all soldiers will be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging his executive order to cut off federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the broadcaster over perceived political slights in news coverage. PBS argues that the order violates the Constitution's protections of speech and press freedom and unlawfully interferes with its editorial independence. The White House defended the order, stating that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was creating media to support a particular political party on taxpayers' money. PBS contends that Trump is legally barred from meddling with the broadcaster's funding or its content.</p>

South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year break due to a shortage of lethal injection drugs.</p>

Sajet had emphasized the gallery's efforts to be even-handed in its portrayals of American presidents.

          <p>Elon Musk deflected a reporter's question about a New York Times article detailing his alleged drug use during President Trump's campaign, as well as family legal drama. During a White House press event, Musk dismissed the question by questioning the credibility of *The New York Times*, referring to their Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Russia-gate. Trump sat next to Musk as he avoided answering the question. Musk had led the DOGE government job-slashing initiative for Trump since January.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel are waiting for Hamas to respond to a 60-day Gaza ceasefire proposal, the White House said Thursday. The proposal outlines a phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a cessation of military activities. Hamas is asking the U.S. for clear guarantees that Israel will not attack Gaza within the 60 days of the ceasefire. The proposal says that President Trump will personally announce the ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <h2>Denying Visas to Chinese Students Could Backfire on America</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece in *The New York Times* argues that denying visas to Chinese students, particularly those pursuing STEM degrees, could harm America. While protecting borders from espionage is essential, the article suggests that a blanket denial based on nationality and field of study is counterproductive. The author argues that limiting access to American universities for talented Chinese students could ultimately weaken America's competitive edge.</p>

          <h2>Senator Defends Medicaid Cuts at Town Hall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 16:37:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst defended proposed cuts to Medicaid at a town hall, responding to concerns that people would die by saying, "Well, we all are going to die." Audience members expressed fears that the cuts would threaten access to healthcare and food benefits. Ernst stated that the focus would be on those most vulnerable and that those who are not eligible should receive benefits elsewhere. The bill would add about $3.8 trillion to the federal government's debt over the next decade.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Sabrina Cervantes, accused of driving under the influence after a car crash, will not face criminal charges after a blood test showed no signs of drugs or alcohol. Sacramento police cited Cervantes on suspicion of DUI after interviewing her at a hospital, where she was being treated after the crash. Prosecutors reviewed all evidence and concluded not to charge her, as the toxicology results tested negative for alcohol or drugs. Cervantes strenuously denied driving while impaired after news of her citation became known.</p>
