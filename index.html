          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in what appears to be a targeted attack. The incident occurred on F Street, near the FBI's field office, and prompted responses from U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi, who were both on the scene. Law enforcement is currently searching for the suspect, while the FBI is assisting the Metropolitan Police Department with the investigation.

          <p>President Trump publicly dressed down South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office, based on a fringe conspiracy theory about the persecution of white South Africans. Trump claimed white people were being 'executed' and questioned Ramaphosa's efforts to address the issue, despite police statistics showing that white people are not more vulnerable to violent crime. This confrontation highlights Trump's views on race and his tendency to elevate claims of white grievance, contrasting with Ramaphosa's appeal for civility and racial reconciliation. Trump even presented a video purporting to show burial sites of murdered white farmers, despite the lack of evidence supporting his claims.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa remained composed during a meeting with President Trump, where he faced accusations and a video presentation about the alleged persecution of white South Africans. Trump's actions were viewed as a choreographed attempt to provoke and humiliate Ramaphosa. Despite the pressure, Ramaphosa maintained his composure and tried to correct the record.

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are decrying as 'the nuclear option.' These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including the 'EV mandate' requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked and will sue if Congress proceeds. The auto industry supports revoking the waivers, while environmental groups warn it undermines pollution control.</p>
