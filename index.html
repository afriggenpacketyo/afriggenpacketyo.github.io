          <p>A new digital reconstruction of a crushed, million-year-old skull found in China suggests a more complex human evolutionary history. The study, published in the journal Science, posits that our ancestors may have diverged 400,000 years earlier than previously believed and potentially in Asia rather than Africa. While the findings could resolve long-standing debates, some experts urge caution, emphasizing the need for more evidence like genetic data to confirm these provocative conclusions. The research highlights the evolving understanding of our origins.</p>

She admitted to seven counts and was convicted of an additional 14 following a trial at Kingston Crown Court. Her actions at two separate nurseries were described as "gratuitous" and "sadistic." The abuse was discovered after she was sent home for pinching children, leading to an investigation and her subsequent conviction and sentencing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than $220 million worth of cocaine from multiple drug-smuggling vessels in the Pacific Ocean. Operations in August and September resulted in the confiscation of nearly 30,000 pounds of narcotics. The drugs were offloaded in San Diego and Florida. As part of the operations, the Coast Guard also released an image of one of the alleged drug boats on fire, though details on how the fire started were not provided. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to combat illicit narcotics trafficking at sea.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Preferred Inflation Gauge Remained Steady in August</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, held steady at a 2.9% annual rate in August. The overall headline PCE rate rose slightly to 2.7%, with both figures aligning with economists' expectations. The Commerce Department report also showed personal income and spending increased, suggesting consumer resilience despite economic pressures like tariffs. These stable inflation readings are unlikely to alter the Federal Reserve's course, with markets still anticipating further interest rate reductions this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The three-week festival, which originated as a harvest celebration in 1818, features fairground rides, parades, and food stalls, hoping to attract millions of visitors.

          <p>Car dealers across the U.S. are reporting significant delays from the IRS in approving and reimbursing federal electric vehicle tax credits, creating financial strain and hindering sales. The issue has become critical as the popular tax credit program is set to expire on September 30. Dealers, who typically front the rebate of up to $7,500 to customers at the point of sale, are now waiting weeks for repayment, forcing some to stop offering the upfront discount. The unexplained delays are creating anxiety and uncertainty for both dealers and consumers rushing to purchase EVs before the deadline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service, a foundational American institution, faces an uncertain future due to persistent financial losses and political pressure from the Trump administration. Having lost over $100 billion since 2007, the agency is undergoing a 10-year modernization plan that includes service slowdowns, particularly affecting rural areas. Meanwhile, President Trump's past calls for privatization and recent reports of absorbing the agency into the Department of Commerce raise concerns about the potential loss of its universal service mandate. This could disproportionately harm rural and low-income communities that rely on the USPS for essential services.</p>

This power would revert to an independent commission in 2031. The proposal is a strategic response to a similar measure in Texas that is expected to create five new Republican-leaning seats. If passed, California's redistricting effort could potentially create up to five new Democratic seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, directly countering the political move made by Texas.</p>

          <p>Community members and immigration advocates in Chicago are rallying in support of Laura Murillo, a well-known tamale vendor who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Supporters gathered to sell her tamales to raise money for her family, highlighting the community's response to the enforcement action and the impact it has on local families and businesses.</p>

          <p>Although President Trump's new 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals target branded and patented drugs, largely sparing India's generic-focused export market, stocks of major Indian drugmakers still fell. Analysts suggest the market reaction reflects broader investor anxiety over escalating U.S.-India trade tensions, not the direct impact of this specific tariff. A recent series of U.S. protectionist measures, including other tariffs and H-1B visa fee hikes, has created a climate of uncertainty. Investors fear further escalations, even though India's competitive position in generic pharmaceuticals provides some insulation from the immediate policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill advancing in Congress, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, aims to make Social Security's retirement benefit options easier for Americans to understand by changing key terminology. The proposal would rename "early eligibility age" to "minimum benefit age" and "full retirement age" to "standard benefit age" to better reflect the financial consequences of claiming at different times. This legislative effort comes amid ongoing debates about the program's long-term solvency and whether the retirement age itself should be raised, a move that currently lacks broad political and public support.</p>

Immigration attorneys report a surge in interest from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India, who see the visa as a bargain for access to the U.S. The program, which promises residency in "record time," is expected to issue 80,000 cards and generate substantial federal revenue. However, the program faces potential legal challenges as it was created via executive order and uses workarounds of existing immigration law set by Congress.</p>

The storm caused widespread flooding, destroyed infrastructure, and halted tourism, leading to significant financial losses for small businesses. Many businesses are still struggling with debt and a 20% drop in vacation rental demand since the hurricane.

          <p>An intellectual property attorney advises that anyone starting a side hustle should, at a minimum, secure a trademark to protect their brand. Darlene Harris, a managing attorney, explains that a trademark acts like a deed to a house, establishing legal ownership of a business name, logo, or slogan. Failing to do so can expose an entrepreneur to lawsuits and financial claims from others who may have a similar brand. She recommends consulting an attorney to develop a broader intellectual property strategy, including copyrights and forming an LLC, to protect both current work and future growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve lowering its benchmark rate, which affects loans like credit cards and auto financing, fixed mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high. This is because mortgage rates are more closely tied to the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, not the Fed's short-term rate. Currently, the gap, or "spread," between Treasury yields and mortgage rates is wider than usual. Economists attribute this to persistent inflation concerns and the Fed's reduced purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, which decreases demand and pushes rates higher for homebuyers.</p>
