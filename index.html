This positive outlook overshadowed a slight miss on quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, with remaining performance obligations increasing dramatically.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the legality of the Trump administration's extensive global tariffs, scheduling arguments for November on an expedited basis. The case challenges whether the president had the authority to impose the levies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Lower courts have previously ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority, a decision which, if upheld, could test the limits of presidential power and potentially require the U.S. to refund billions in collected tariffs.</p>

          <p>House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith stated that Congress would "respond accordingly" if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's global tariffs. While affirming his close work with the administration on the policy, Smith did not commit to passing the tariffs through congressional legislation, a move that could prove divisive among Republicans. The comments highlight the political tightrope for lawmakers who might have to choose between supporting a president popular with their base and constituents who are largely unfavorable toward tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" commission released a report on chronic illnesses in children that stopped short of recommending direct restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods. The report, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., focuses instead on overhauling the vaccine injury system and reviewing psychiatric prescriptions for children. Critics from scientific, health, and environmental groups condemned the report as a "gift" to large agricultural and chemical corporations, arguing it ignores key environmental health drivers and promotes industry-friendly deregulation.</p>

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing the decision subjects countless people to indignities based on their appearance, a stark contrast to the court's previous rulings against using race in college admissions.</p>

          <p>An Italian journalist has defended herself against accusations of racism after she pointedly excluded actress Ayo Edebiri from a question about the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements. During a press event, the journalist directed her question about the "politically correct era" only to Edebiri's white co-stars, Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. Edebiri interjected to state that the work of these movements is not "done," a response that drew widespread praise, while the journalist later claimed she was being cyberbullied and that her question was misunderstood.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a federal criminal charge against Decarlos Brown Jr., the man accused of the fatal stabbing of 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a light rail train in Charlotte. The charge of causing death on a mass transportation system makes him eligible for the death penalty. The unprovoked attack, captured on surveillance video, has drawn national attention, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating her office will seek the maximum penalty for the "horrific murder."</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has issued a temporary stay on a lower court ruling that would have compelled the Trump administration to unfreeze over $4 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid. The administrative stay gives the Supreme Court more time to consider the administration's emergency request to halt the order. The case centers on the president's attempt to cancel the funding through a rare "pocket rescission" maneuver, a move that opponents argue is an unconstitutional overreach of executive power and a violation of Congress's power of the purse.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials report that Russia is escalating its air attacks, using larger and more frequent waves of missiles and drones to target critical sites and overwhelm air defenses. A recent strike on a government building in Kyiv was identified as a Russian Iskander cruise missile, which fortunately failed to detonate, limiting the damage. In a separate, deadlier attack, a glide bomb killed more than 20 civilians in the Donbas region, prompting President Zelensky to condemn the "savage" act and renew calls for international support.</p>

          <p>Israel's targeted strike on Hamas leadership in Doha is being interpreted as a strong signal that its government remains committed to a military victory over a negotiated ceasefire. The attack, which occurred as Hamas leaders were reportedly discussing a U.S. ceasefire proposal, suggests a diminished interest in diplomacy and could jeopardize Qatar's role as a key mediator. The move has been praised across Israel's political spectrum, but families of hostages have expressed fear that it has endangered their loved ones and sabotaged any chance of a deal.</p>

          <p>The recent Israeli strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha has put a spotlight on Qatar's complex and often controversial role as a key international mediator. The Gulf state leverages its vast wealth and relationships with a wide array of actors, including the U.S., Iran, and Hamas, to broker deals in global conflicts. While this strategy has elevated its diplomatic standing, it also carries significant risks, as demonstrated by the attack on its soil, which challenges its ability to operate as a neutral ground for sensitive negotiations.</p>

          <p>Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who led controversial immigration raids in Southern California, has been deployed to Chicago to lead a new enforcement surge. This move is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to use Border Patrol agents for interior enforcement, targeting immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, far from the border. Bovino's operations in California were criticized and legally challenged for allegedly using racial profiling, and his arrival signals an escalation of the administration's crackdown in the Chicago area.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump in July will have varied impacts across different states. Residents of high-income states like Wyoming are projected to receive the largest average tax cuts, while those in lower-income states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest benefits. The law's structure, which provides larger cuts to high-earners and includes provisions like a higher cap for state and local tax deductions, contributes to this geographic disparity.

          <p>Hamas has announced that an Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, killed six people, including the son of a senior official, but stated that its negotiating team survived the assassination attempt. The attack targeted a residential compound where leaders were meeting to discuss a U.S. ceasefire proposal, prompting condemnation from Qatar and concern from the White House. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the strike as "fully justified," stating it targeted those responsible for the October 7th attacks, further complicating diplomatic efforts to end the war.</p>
