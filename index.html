          <h2>Germany's New Government Faces Challenges in Addressing Climate Crisis</h2>

          <p>Germany's new coalition government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, faces significant challenges in tackling climate change amidst pressing economic and international issues. While the coalition agreement commits to climate neutrality by 2045, experts express concern that environmental protection is not a top priority. Conflicts between the environment and economy ministries could resurface, potentially hindering progress. The new environment minister, Carsten Schneider, an SPD politician, is largely unknown in the climate sphere and will be responsible for international climate negotiations, a role previously held by the foreign ministry. The country faces an uphill battle to meet its emission reduction targets, with considerable room for improvement in the building and energy sectors.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings per share exceeded analysts' expectations, but revenue fell short, causing the company's shares to dip. While revenue grew 14% year-over-year, gross bookings in both the ride-hailing and delivery segments increased. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi remains optimistic, projecting strong gross bookings and EBITDA for the current quarter. The company is also expanding into autonomous vehicles, with 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. The company is dealing with a lawsuit from the FTC regarding its Uber One subscription service, which the CEO has defended.</p>

          <p>A global resurgence of measles is occurring due to declining vaccination rates, with outbreaks reported in every region of the world. Measles is highly infectious, requiring a 95% immunization rate to achieve herd immunity, but vaccine uptake has fallen in recent years due to misinformation and disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health experts emphasize that misinformation campaigns have contributed to lower vaccine confidence, and that improved access to healthcare and political commitment are crucial for sustaining high vaccination rates. Measles is preventable through vaccination, and immunization efforts have averted millions of deaths globally, so increasing vaccine uptake is essential to control the disease.</p>

          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora has cautioned that U.S. tariffs could lead to sweeping price increases across the affordable jewelry industry. CEO Alexander Lacik noted that current tariffs are manageable, but higher reciprocal rates would significantly impact manufacturers who rely on Asian production. Pandora, heavily dependent on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, previously warned of a potential hit to group revenues due to President Trump's tariff policies. The ultimate impact on consumer pricing is expected to be industry-led, depending on the level of tariffs imposed.</p>

          <p>A Republican plan to extend the 2017 tax law, spearheaded by House Speaker Mike Johnson, aims to provide an economic boost amidst concerns over President Trump's tariffs. However, the article argues that this strategy may not be effective in counteracting the economic damage caused by the tariffs. The author, Brendan Buck, a former counselor to House Speaker Paul Ryan, suggests that voters may not reward Republicans for simply preserving existing tax rates, especially if the tariffs continue to negatively impact the economy. Buck emphasizes that congressional leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policy to achieve a stable economic footing.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) began enforcing Real ID requirements, meaning that IDs not compliant with Real ID standards will no longer be accepted at airport security checkpoints. The TSA will accept other forms of identification, such as U.S. passports and military IDs. Travelers without acceptable identification may undergo additional screening to verify their identity, but Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has assured that people will be allowed to fly, though additional delays may be possible. TSA urges travelers to arrive early and be prepared for advanced screening.</p>

          <p>Disney is partnering with Miral to open a new theme park resort on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. The resort will offer signature Disney entertainment, themed accommodations, unique dining and retail experiences, and storytelling that celebrates both Disney's heritage and Abu Dhabi's cultural essence. The resort will be fully developed and operated by Miral, with Disney providing creative design and operational oversight. The location is expected to be a major tourist destination due to the United Arab Emirates being within a four-hour flight of one-third of the world's population.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea for the second time in just over a week, but the pilots sustained only minor injuries. The official said in a statement that the Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman Tuesday "when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard." The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since it deployed to the Middle East in September 2024.</p>

          <p>India launched strikes on what it claimed were terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan, following a deadly attack in Kashmir. Pakistan's military reported that the strikes killed at least 26 people and launched a retaliatory attack, shooting down five Indian aircraft. The strikes hit multiple locations, and the Indian Defense Ministry said the actions were measured and non-escalatory, while Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war. The U.N.

Around 45 Labour MPs and senior figures, including Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan, are urging the government to reconsider the move, which has been partly blamed for the party's poor performance in recent local elections. Starmer stated that the government's priority is to restore financial order, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the decision and urged him to listen to his own party.</p>
