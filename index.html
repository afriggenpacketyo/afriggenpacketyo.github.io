          <p>President Trump signed executive orders intended to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors in the United States. The orders seek to streamline the licensing process for nuclear reactors, mandating decisions within 18 months, and encourage uranium mining and enrichment. The administration aims to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors on federal land for national security purposes and to power critical defense facilities. These actions are part of a broader effort to boost investment in nuclear power, which has faced financial challenges in recent years due to competition from cheap natural gas. </p>

          <p>Eight individuals were found guilty in a Paris court for their involvement in the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian during Paris Fashion Week, where millions of dollars' worth of jewelry were stolen. The defendants, comprising three pensioners and one man in his 30s, faced charges ranging from direct participation in the heist to aiding the plot. Kardashian testified that she feared for her life during the robbery, which prompted her to increase her security measures and limit real-time personal information shared online. The stolen jewelry, including a diamond engagement ring, was never recovered, but Kardashian received an insurance payout of approximately $6 million. </p>

The move follows a weakening of Iran-backed militias in the region after recent wars with Israel. There are approximately 222,000 Palestinian refugees residing in 12 camps across Lebanon, where security is often managed by armed factions, leading to internal clashes and civilian deaths. </p>

          <p>New Jersey's upcoming gubernatorial election is drawing national attention as a potential indicator of the country's political mood ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Experts suggest the race could reflect voter sentiment toward President Trump and the strength of his endorsement of Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.

DOGE claims that it has terminated five "wasteful" surveys, but it did not specify which surveys were ended.

The bill also includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime pay. However, some policy experts say that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear, as almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax. </p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the European Union, citing slow progress in trade negotiations. He also threatened to impose a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in America. These announcements have sparked worries globally, as they will make it more expensive and difficult for foreign businesses to sell goods in the world's largest economy. Shares in the U.S. and EU fell after the latest threats, with Apple's stock also declining. </p>

TJX is better insulated from tariff pressure, as only about 10% of its merchandise is directly imported from China, due to its brand-driven product mix. TJX also benefits from a vast network of vendors across over 100 countries, enabling it to source products at the best possible prices. Management believes it can offset tariff pressures, which is why they reaffirmed their full-year outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students. The ruling came after Harvard filed a lawsuit, arguing that the administration's decision was a "blatant violation" of the law and free speech rights. The Trump administration claims Harvard has not done enough to fight antisemitism and change its hiring and admissions practices, allegations that the university has strongly denied. The judge's order pauses the Department of Homeland Security's move to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). </p>
