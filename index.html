          <p>A Russian drone strike on a passenger bus in the town of Bilopillia, located in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, resulted in the deaths of nine people and injuries to four others, according to local Ukrainian officials. Emergency services and medical personnel are currently at the scene providing assistance. This incident occurred shortly after reports emerged that Russia and Ukraine had engaged in their first direct peace talks since 2022, although those talks failed to result in a ceasefire agreement, indicating the ongoing intensity of the conflict despite diplomatic efforts. The attack underscores the continued risk to civilian populations in the region.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that President Trump's supporters interpreted as a veiled threat. The post featured seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some Trump supporters saw as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, emphasizing his opposition to violence. Despite Comey's explanation, Trump and top administration officials rejected his defense, labeling Comey a "dirty cop" and accusing him of calling for the "assassination of the president."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent gang under the Alien Enemies Act while the matter is litigated in the courts. The ruling suggested that a majority of the justices were skeptical of whether the migrants had been afforded enough due process protections. The justices sent the case back to an appeals court, directing it to examine the migrants' claims that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act and to consider how much notice the government should be required to provide migrants so they have an opportunity to challenge their deportations. The article also covers a New Jersey Transit strike that left commuters scrambling and the investigation of James Comey over a social media post.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the controversy surrounding Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about President Joe Biden's mental acuity. The report, based on interviews from October 2023, cited memory lapses and a halting tone in Biden's speech. Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy questioned Biden about the report's characterization of him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." Biden responded defiantly, asserting his competence and dismissing the need for Hur's recommendation. The article also mentions the political fallout from the report, with Republicans seizing on it to question Biden's fitness for office.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, significantly reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its second-ever dust storm warning for the region. The storm, driven by winds of 60 to 70 mph over dry farmlands, caused near-zero visibility in some areas, forcing drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and halting flights at Midway International Airport for about an hour. The dust storm also impacted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois, where attendees experienced blowing debris and dirt. While dust storm warnings are more common in rural parts of central and southern Illinois, this event marked the first time such a warning included the city of Chicago itself.</p>

          <p>The trial against Sean "Diddy" Combs hinges significantly on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura, who alleges years of abuse and coercion into unwanted sex acts. Ventura's emotional account detailed beatings and drug-fueled encounters with prostitutes, painting a picture of a controlling and violent relationship. Prosecutors aim to prove that Combs was not just an abuser but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise. The defense concedes abuse but argues that it does not equate to sex trafficking, while the prosecution seeks to establish elements of force, fraud, or coercion, crucial for a sex trafficking conviction.</p>

          <p>Ammunition manufacturers in Gorazde, Bosnia, face an uncertain future due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods exported to the United States, their largest market. These companies, which survived the Balkan wars, now worry that the tariffs will halt exports and force them to scale back expansion plans. The tariffs have also disrupted the U.S.A.I.D. projects, further clouding Gorazde’s economic prospects. While Bosnia has increased exports to the U.S. in recent years, the tariffs threaten a vital lifeline for Gorazde, a town heavily reliant on ammunition production.</p>

While the charges against Joseph were eventually dropped, the case underscores the complexities and potential for federal overreach when immigration enforcement intersects with state judicial proceedings.

Mitsuo Hosaka, a worker at a child welfare center, took charge of 53 children, many of whom were hostile and brainwashed, demanding to be returned to the cult. Over time, through nourishment, play, and re-pampering, the children began to regain their childlike selves, breaking free from the cult's indoctrination.

          <p>Audio recordings from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden, conducted as part of a Justice Department investigation, have been released, highlighting instances of memory lapses and a halting tone of voice. The recordings, obtained by Axios, feature Biden struggling to recall key dates and milestones, including the year his son Beau died and the year President Trump was first elected. The release of the audio provides additional context to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which described Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory," and comes amid renewed scrutiny of Biden's cognitive abilities.</p>

          <p>An audio clip from President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s 2023 special counsel interview, released by Axios, reveals him speaking softly and haltingly as he struggled to recall key dates. The clip, part of an investigation into Mr. Biden’s handling of classified documents, captures Mr. Biden stumbling over the years his son died, Donald J. Trump was first elected, and when he left office as vice president. This release follows Mr. Hur's decision not to seek charges, citing Mr. Biden's likely sympathetic appearance to a jury as an older man with a poor memory, and occurs amid new revelations about Mr. Biden’s health while in office.</p>
