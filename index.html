            <p>China's economy grew by 5.4% in the first quarter, surpassing expectations despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S. This growth, fueled by policy stimulus, builds on the recovery that started in late 2024. Retail sales and industrial output also exceeded forecasts, although investment banks have lowered China's growth outlook due to the ongoing tariff war. The Chinese leadership aims for around 5% annual growth, but achieving this goal may be challenging given trade uncertainties and weak domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has finalized a $150 million grant to construct a new port of entry facility on the San Diego-Baja California border.

            <p>Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion financial impact due to tightened U.S. export regulations on AI chips to China. The new rules require licenses for exporting the H20 AI chip, a popular product in China. The U.S. government cites concerns that the chips may be used in Chinese supercomputers. Analysts believe this move is part of the escalating trade war and could lead to a complete decoupling of U.S. and China AI semiconductor supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge warned Trump administration officials that "nothing has been done" to return a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, giving them two weeks to submit evidence of their efforts. Judge Paula Xinis accused officials of inaction and threatened contempt of court. The Supreme Court ordered the administration to "facilitate" the man's release, but El Salvador's president refused to return him. The case highlights a constitutional showdown between the administration and the judiciary.</p>

            <p>A study has found that the use of disposable e-cigarettes, or vapes, is declining in the UK ahead of a government ban scheduled for June 1, 2025. Researchers believe users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban. A University College London study showed a nearly half drop in the percentage of 16-24 year olds who mainly use disposable vapes, from 63% to 35% in the last year. Overall vaping use stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16, after several years of significant growth.</p>
