          <h2>Japanese Public Servants Face Abuse from Residents, Survey Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 01:14:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government survey in Japan indicates that 35% of local government officials have experienced abusive behavior from residents, a figure significantly higher than that of private-sector workers. This suggests that public officials, who are constitutionally obligated to serve the entire community, frequently encounter unreasonable demands from taxpayers. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications suggests this disparity may arise because local governments cannot choose their constituents, unlike private companies. Consequently, both local governments and companies are increasingly implementing measures to protect their employees from customer harassment.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan migrants facing deportation under the Alien Enemies Act are reportedly given only 12 hours to decide if they wish to contest their removal, according to recently unsealed court documents. The government argues this complies with a Supreme Court ruling requiring a "reasonable" appeal time, while ACLU lawyers contend this timeframe is insufficient for migrants to seek legal counsel and understand their rights. The wartime act has been used to deport Venezuelans accused of gang affiliation to a prison in El Salvador. The ACLU is challenging the government's timeline, arguing that it violates due process.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers are seeking the return of approximately 140 Venezuelan migrants who were deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.

Judges have criticized the White House's use of the wartime statute, with one federal judge in Manhattan stating that "cows have better treatment now under the law." The lawyers have secured provisional orders in five states to halt further deportations under the act.</p>

          <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has indicated that Ukraine might need to cede territory to Russia as part of a potential peace agreement, amidst growing pressure from President Donald Trump to accept territorial concessions. Klitschko stressed that the Ukrainian people would "never accept occupation" by Russia, even if territorial concessions lead to a 'temporary' peace. His remarks came shortly after a devastating Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv, which resulted in numerous casualties. Klitschko's statement marks one of the most senior Ukrainian politicians to publicly suggest territorial concessions as a possible solution.</p>

          <p>The Post Office in the UK has spent over Â£600 million in public funds to continue using the flawed Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it over a decade ago. The original 1999 agreement with Fujitsu restricted the Post Office from owning the core computer code, preventing them from building a replacement and forcing reliance on Fujitsu's assurances. This dependence led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters for alleged financial discrepancies, based on the Horizon system's data. The Post Office finally obtained rights to the software in 2023 but continues to struggle with replacing the system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has voiced his disapproval of the deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv, stating that he is "not happy" and urging President Vladimir Putin to "stop." The attacks, which killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others, have complicated efforts to advance a peace deal. Trump indicated that he is putting pressure on both sides to end the war and that his special envoy will hold talks with Putin in Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for more forceful action from the U.S. to secure a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funds from cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The judge issued a temporary injunction, declaring that portions of Donald Trump's executive orders were unconstitutional. The ruling prevents the federal government from withholding, freezing, or conditioning federal funds. The plaintiffs argued that the orders amounted to overreach and an attempt to force cities to participate in mass deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's foreign minister has called for a "coalition" of countries to address the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump. The minister emphasized that Trump's tariffs have created uncertainty for everyone, including countries considered close to the United States. He touted Beijing as an important advocate for a multilateral world. Switzerland, with its small and open economy, is significantly impacted by Trump's protectionist measures.</p>

          <p>Robert Douglas, the founder of the Black Dog on Martha's Vineyard, has died at the age of 93. Douglas transformed the tavern's logo of his Labrador retriever mix into an international emblem for summertime. He moved to Martha's Vineyard in 1960 and initially designed a topsail schooner before opening the Black Dog restaurant. His Labrador-boxer mix, Black Dog, named after a pirate in "Treasure Island," became the restaurant's mascot.</p>
