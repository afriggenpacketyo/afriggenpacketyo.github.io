          <p>A federal appeals court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 individuals from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The court acknowledged the plaintiffs' case has merit but found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues, placing thousands at risk of deportation. Advocacy groups expressed alarm, warning that lives will be upended and allies could be forced into hiding. The administration argues the program is temporary and conditions in the home countries have improved, a claim disputed by critics and the State Department's own travel advisories.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing President Trump of creating deliberate distractions to shift public attention away from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Recent presidential posts on topics ranging from the Washington Commanders' name to the Bryan Kohberger case are seen by some political opponents as attempts to deflect from the administration's handling of the Epstein investigation. The Department of Justice's announcement that no "client list" exists has angered some of Trump's own supporters, increasing pressure on the White House. Figures like Senator Adam Schiff and Reverend Al Sharpton claim these actions are a transparent effort to manage the political fallout.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight bound for Minot, North Dakota, performed a sudden and "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military aircraft. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport, had not warned him about the bomber's presence. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair. The Air Force and the FAA are now investigating the incident, which highlighted a serious communication breakdown that could have led to a catastrophic accident, but was averted by the pilot's quick actions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The defunding measure was part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by Congress. Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the law likely unconstitutionally punishes Planned Parenthood affiliates that do not provide abortions and that blocking the funding cut poses minimal harm to the government while the lawsuit proceeds. Planned Parenthood argued that losing the funding would force clinic closures and severely impact access to non-abortion healthcare for over a million people.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs may have a "silver lining" by forcing other countries and trading blocs to confront their own protectionist policies. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is compelling nations like Canada and China to dismantle long-standing internal trade barriers and regulations that have hindered their own growth. The piece suggests this self-reflection and subsequent domestic reform could unlock economic potential that equals or exceeds the losses from the tariffs. However, it notes the European Union seems more focused on a war economy than on implementing similar free-market reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, Bessent argued that excessive capital requirements are stifling lending and distorting markets. He specifically called for abandoning a proposed Biden-era rule that would have required banks to comply with two different methods of measuring risk capital, arguing it was designed simply to increase capital aggregates without a principled basis.

          <p>The White House has retaliated against the Wall Street Journal by removing one of its reporters from the press pool for an upcoming presidential trip to Scotland. The move follows the newspaper's report on an alleged birthday letter from President Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which prompted a $10 billion libel lawsuit from Trump. The White House Correspondents' Association strongly condemned the decision, calling it a troubling attempt to punish a media outlet for its coverage that defies the First Amendment.

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth's rotation is currently speeding up, causing days to be marginally shorter. This trend, if it continues, could force global timekeepers to take an unprecedented step: subtracting a "negative leap second" from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep atomic clocks aligned with the planet's rotation. While factors like the moon's gravity and seasonal atmospheric changes influence the speed, one study suggests that melting polar ice due to climate change is actually counteracting the acceleration.

          <p>An in-depth analysis explores how the Trump administration is leveraging the judicial system and a flurry of executive orders to advance its agenda, creating an unprecedented level of confrontation with federal courts. Recent Supreme Court rulings have emboldened the administration, which has launched a "full-frontal onslaught" against district judges who have blocked its policies. This dynamic, coupled with rising threats against the judiciary, is raising questions about the balance of power in the U.S. government. The article examines whether this represents a permanent reshaping of presidential authority and how the judiciary might reassert its independence.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has asked the Justice Department to investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges the university uses diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as a proxy for race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby circumventing the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action. The group is calling for a federal investigation and a suspension of federal funding for the university. This action represents a new front in the conservative legal battle against DEI programs in higher education.</p>

          <p>A former Kentucky police officer, Brett Hankison, has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the fatal 2020 raid on her home. The judge rejected a controversial recommendation from the Trump administration's Justice Department for only a one-day sentence, stating that no prison time was inappropriate for the crime. Hankison was the only officer convicted in connection with the raid, which became a focal point for the Black Lives Matter movement. Taylor's family expressed gratitude for the sentence but noted it was a small piece of justice.</p>

The move is notable as the iconic burger chain was founded in California and has its largest presence there.

          <p>Amid heightened scrutiny of his past, a 2006 interview from "The Howard Stern Show" has resurfaced in which Donald Trump discussed his sexual "age limit." When asked by the host, Trump stated he had "no problem" with dating 24-year-olds and, when pressed on a lower limit, remarked he didn't "want to be like Congressman Foley, with, you know, 12-year-olds." The comments are regaining attention as Trump faces questions about his past association with Jeffrey Epstein and a recent Wall Street Journal report about a letter he allegedly sent the financier, which has since led to a major libel lawsuit.</p>

The letter follows revelations from defender Jess Carter that she has been a target of racist abuse throughout the recent tournament.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's governance is driven not by coherent policy but by a culture of anger, fear, and small-minded pettiness. The author cites numerous examples, from renaming military bases to feuding with the Fed chair and retaliating against former intelligence officials, as evidence of a vengeful and emotional approach to leadership. This style has been internalized by his administration, leading to decisions based on personal slights rather than national interest. The article suggests that this focus on grievance and culture-warring may appeal to his base but fails to address substantive national problems.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has received Pentagon approval to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana for detaining immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. The plan also includes expanding detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This measure, enabled by a national emergency declaration at the border, allows DHS to house up to 1,000 people at each of the new domestic sites. Critics, including the New Jersey Democratic congressional delegation, have condemned the move as an inappropriate use of military resources that jeopardizes military preparedness for political purposes.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese citizens are feeling a significant disconnect between the government's robust headline economic figures and their personal financial struggles. Despite official data suggesting a strong economy, many individuals, like an accountant in Chengdu who hasn't had a raise in five years, are facing wage stagnation and the threat of layoffs. Experts note that what people are experiencing in their daily lives—a weak job market and uncertainty about the future—paints a different picture from the rosy data. This sentiment gap poses a challenge for Beijing as it tries to manage economic expectations in the second half of the year.</p>

Notably, Judge Gayles also presided over a previous lawsuit Trump brought against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, which Trump voluntarily dropped after the judge scheduled a deposition. This assignment raises the possibility that Trump will again face being questioned under oath, this time regarding his past association with Jeffrey Epstein and the alleged birthday letter at the center of the lawsuit. Legal experts are divided on whether Trump will pursue the case or withdraw as he did previously.</p>

          <p>According to a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), President Trump's recently signed tax bill is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The legislation makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting corporations, while offsetting only a fraction of the cost with $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs. The CBO estimates these cuts will result in 10 million Americans losing health insurance by 2034. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects an even higher debt increase of $4.1 trillion when including interest costs. (not investment advice)</p>
