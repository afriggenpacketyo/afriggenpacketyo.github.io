          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that a significant majority (83.7%) of Japanese citizens are worried about the potential impact of the escalating Israel-Iran conflict on their daily lives, primarily due to Japan's reliance on the Middle East for oil. The poll also revealed a decline in public approval for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, falling to 32.5% from 37.0% the previous week, with disapproval rising to 50.9%. The survey also touched on topics such as tax policy and corporate donations. The poll surveyed 425 household members and 625 mobile phone users.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece asserts that the phrase "globalize the intifada" represents a dangerous, growing anti-Jewish movement in the United States, not merely solidarity with Gaza. The author, a former envoy to the Middle East, cites examples of violence against Jews and Israel supporters in America, including the firebombing of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's home and an attack on Israeli embassy staffers. The piece argues that these incidents should not be contextualized as byproducts of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but rather as expressions of deep-seated antisemitism. The author calls for deporting aliens who support violence to contain the problem.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's key nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have renewed their calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic and its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah, stated that the attacks were a result of the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons at the expense of the Iranian people. Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, echoed this sentiment, urging Khamenei to step down and advocating for a free, democratic, and non-nuclear Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, describing it as a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The U.S. claims the sites have been "completely and totally obliterated." Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, but Trump warned that any retaliation "WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT." The strikes have drawn mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers and international figures.</p>
