          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are preparing for their Rugby World Cup semi-final against France, aiming to extend their record-breaking 31-match winning streak. Despite England's statistical dominance, including 16 consecutive wins against France, the French team remains the only side to have come within seven points of them recently. France is dealing with key player suspensions and injuries, yet their captain emphasizes that past statistics are irrelevant in a World Cup semi-final. England, having settled on their team, is focused on securing a place in the final, highlighting the high stakes for both nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many individuals using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are experiencing significant loose skin after shedding substantial weight, leading to self-consciousness and a desire for cosmetic surgery. While the drugs effectively suppress appetite and aid rapid weight loss, the skin, once stretched, often remains so, especially after significant reduction. Medical experts note that surgery is typically the only effective solution for substantial loose skin, but these body contouring procedures are rarely available on the NHS due to cost and priority. Patients like Emilly Murray and Grace Parkin are saving for private or overseas surgeries, highlighting the financial and physical challenges that follow medical weight loss.</p>

          <p>The return to school has reignited discussions around parent WhatsApp groups, with some parents finding them helpful for school information while others are choosing to leave due to stress and competitive dynamics. Claire Berry, a mother of three, quit her groups after experiencing divisive chats and unnecessary anxiety caused by polarized opinions on school policies. Concerns also include the disproportionate burden on mothers for school admin and the constant stream of notifications. While useful for coordinating gifts or sharing schedules, these groups can also lead to public shaming and a platform for 'humble brags,' creating a complex communication environment for parents and schools alike.</p>

Spanberger is campaigning on affordability issues, while Earle-Sears aligns herself with Governor Glenn Youngkin's economic record and Trump's agenda. The Trump administration's federal workforce cuts, particularly the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are a significant issue in Virginia, a state with many federal workers.

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, a 37-year-old Chinese executive of Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a U.S. prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and his marketing manager, Yiyi Chen (sentenced to 15 years), were convicted of fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering. This case marks the first time the U.S. Justice Department has charged Chinese companies for directly trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals into the United States. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin, is a major contributor to overdose deaths in the U.S., making this a significant step in combating the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>Walmart's online marketplace is facing a significant issue with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers, as a CNBC investigation revealed. Shoppers, like Mary May who received fake brain supplements, are unwittingly purchasing potentially dangerous items from third-party vendors. The investigation found at least 43 sellers used stolen business identities, and former employees indicated that Walmart loosened its vetting processes to compete with Amazon. While Walmart states a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited products, critics argue its marketplace resembles a 'flea market' due to lax controls. This expansion has boosted Walmart's e-commerce profits but at the cost of consumer trust and safety.</p>

          <p>A columnist recounts a direct message from conservative activist Charlie Kirk, received the day before his assassination, in which Kirk invited him for a respectful conversation about crime and race. Despite their public disagreements, Kirk sought dialogue and civility, expressing a desire to "disagree about the issues agreeably." The article emphasizes the importance of condemning political violence unconditionally, especially in a country grappling with rising tensions and assassinations. The author urges both political sides to heed Kirk's last message for dialogue and de-escalation, rather than using his death to justify further division or censorship.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), established in 1934, is responsible for authorizing broadcasting frequencies and setting rules for local TV and radio stations, though it does not directly oversee national networks or online content. Recent controversies, such as FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's threats against ABC following Jimmy Kimmel's comments, have raised questions about the administration's power to revoke broadcast licenses. While the FCC generally aims to ensure broadcasting serves the public interest, it is legally barred from preventing the broadcast of specific viewpoints. Experts note that FCC rules are broad, theoretically allowing license rescission, but enforcement has been less frequent since the 1980s.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a productive phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during which they reportedly approved a deal regarding the future of TikTok's US operations. While Trump indicated a deal for TikTok's US business to be sold to American investors, China's state news agency Xinhua offered a more ambiguous statement, welcoming negotiations. A key sticking point remains the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm. Many US lawmakers, including Republicans, express unease over ByteDance's links to the Chinese Communist Party. Trump, who previously sought to ban TikTok, now views it as crucial for his 2024 campaign, with a formal signing process expected soon.</p>

          <p>Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old Sikh woman who has lived in California for over three decades, was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, sparking shock and sympathy within the Sikh community. Kaur, who unsuccessfully applied for asylum and had regularly reported to immigration authorities for years, was detained during a routine check-in. Her family describes her as distraught and facing difficult conditions, including alleged denial of medication and appropriate meals. Critics, including state senators and congressmen, condemn the detention, arguing it reflects misplaced priorities in Trump's immigration crackdown, targeting peaceful individuals without criminal records.</p>

The article humorously suggests finding optimism amidst political turbulence, such as the lack of arrests at Kimmel protests and the 'geography lesson' from Trump's mispronunciations. It also touches on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health initiatives and the administration's approach to cancer research, all framed with a sardonic tone. The piece concludes by proposing custom hats for everyone, including Kimmel, proclaiming their infallibility, as a nod to Trump's 'TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!' merchandise.</p>

          <p>Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have voted to shift Covid-19 vaccine recommendations towards shared clinical decision-making, meaning individuals must consult a healthcare provider. This move, however, did not include a prescription requirement, which was narrowly rejected. The committee specified that people 65 and older, and those aged 6 months to 64 at increased risk for severe Covid-19, should make vaccination decisions with a doctor. Experts warn this change could lead to confusion and decreased vaccine uptake, especially given disparities in healthcare access, potentially creating a patchwork of vaccine availability across states.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the US Supreme Court for a second time to intervene in a case concerning its bid to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. The Justice Department filed an emergency application to lift a federal judge's ruling that the Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem, lacked authority to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans. This move aligns with Trump's broader crackdown on immigration and aims to expand the pool of potential deportees. The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May, and lower courts have expressed confusion regarding emergency orders issued with minimal reasoning.</p>
