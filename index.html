          <p>During a press conference intended to honor the late professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, a heckler interrupted Florida Governor Ron DeSantis with a profane outburst. The individual criticized the governor's immigration policies, specifically referencing a $245 million detention center dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The governor, who had been sharing a personal memory of Hogan, directed authorities to remove the man from the room. The incident, which occurred just minutes into the event, highlighted the intense political division surrounding the state's approach to immigration, momentarily overshadowing the tribute to the iconic wrestler who had passed away earlier that day.</p>

          <h2>Fired Federal Immigration Judges Allege Terminations Were Arbitrary and Politically Motivated</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three federal immigration judges, recently fired via email, have publicly condemned their dismissals as arbitrary and an assault on the rule of law. The judges, who presided over thousands of cases in Chicago and Boston, revealed they experienced direct pressure from the Justice Department to rule in certain ways, creating a climate of fear that they believe compromises judicial impartiality. This situation unfolds as the nation's immigration court backlog approaches four million cases, with the judges' union reporting that over 100 judges have been fired or have departed since the current administration began, sparking profound concerns about due process within the immigration system.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Tallahassee Chuck E. Cheese was arrested while dressed as the chain's mouse mascot in connection with a debit card theft. Police allege the man stole a customer's card during a child's party in June and subsequently used it for multiple purchases. The victim reportedly conducted her own investigation, obtaining security footage that helped identify the suspect. Officers confronted the costumed employee at the restaurant, leading to an arrest where the stolen card was allegedly found in his pocket, an unusual scene that unfolded in front of children and other patrons.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service suffered a significant network outage on Thursday, affecting tens of thousands of users globally. The disruption, which lasted approximately 2.5 hours according to the company, came just after T-Mobile launched its new satellite-powered service using Starlink's network. While the cause of the outage was not immediately specified, it prompted an apology from Musk on X, who stated that service would be restored shortly.

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order aimed at establishing new federal rules for the compensation of college athletes, addressing the evolving landscape of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to prohibit what it terms "third-party, pay-for-play payments" while preserving athletes' rights to secure brand endorsements. It also mandates that revenue-sharing agreements must protect or expand opportunities in women's and non-revenue sports. The move represents a significant federal intervention into the NCAA's domain, aiming to create uniform standards and prevent the system from becoming, as the White House described it, "out-of-control."</p>

The move was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who argued it rewards terrorism.

This commentary comes as companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft plan to spend a combined $320 billion on AI and data centers in 2025.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, who is entering the third year of his modest rookie contract, is positioned for a significant payday as he becomes eligible for an extension next offseason. Following his record-setting rookie year and strong sophomore season, his market value has soared, especially as other young receivers secure deals worth over $90 million in guarantees. While Nacua states he is focused on the present, his continued high-level performance could lead to a lucrative, nine-figure contract. His development has been a major bargain for the Rams, who drafted him in the fifth round.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday designed to compel local authorities to remove unhoused individuals from public spaces and restore public order. The order aims to reverse judicial precedents that limit a city's ability to clear encampments and seeks to redirect funds toward long-term institutional treatment and rehabilitation, including through civil commitment. This move represents a significant federal push for a more punitive approach to the nation's worsening homelessness crisis. Civil liberties and housing advocates have condemned the order, arguing it criminalizes homelessness and will ultimately exacerbate the problem without addressing its root causes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the reasons why the Biden administration did not release the complete set of investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein, despite their potential political implications for Donald Trump. It posits that appearing in the files does not inherently imply wrongdoing and that releasing such sensitive information, particularly secret grand jury testimony, outside of a courtroom setting is highly unusual and legally complex. The government's standard practice is to protect individual privacy and ongoing investigations. Therefore, even if the administration had a political motive, it faced significant legal and procedural barriers to making the full dossier public.</p>

          <p>Federal regulators have officially approved the $8 billion merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global, a deal that has been mired in political controversy. FCC Chair Brendan Carr, appointed by President Trump, praised Skydance's commitments to address alleged conservative bias at CBS News and eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The approval followed a $16 million settlement paid by Paramount to Trump over a lawsuit he filed against the company. The lone Democratic commissioner dissented, calling the deal a result of "cowardly capitulation" that erodes press freedom and sets a dangerous precedent for corporate media.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has reached a deal with the Trump administration, agreeing to pay over $221 million and make other concessions to settle discrimination allegations and restore hundreds of millions in frozen federal research funding. The administration had targeted Columbia, citing alleged antisemitism on campus following high-profile pro-Palestinian student protests earlier this year. The settlement is seen as a victory for the administration's strategy of pressuring major American institutions, including universities and corporations, that it perceives as hostile.

          <p>Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer at tech company Astronomer, has resigned from her position.

The clip appeared to show the two executives embracing before abruptly hiding from the arena's large video screen. The incident gained massive social media attention and led to an internal investigation by the data and AI startup.

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be credible or reliable, and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The players had been accused of assaulting the woman after a Hockey Canada gala. The central issue of the closely watched trial was whether the woman, who was 20 at the time, had consented to the sexual acts that occurred with the group of players.</p>

The synthetic crystal, measuring 60 millimeters in diameter, is exceptionally durable and can efficiently convert laser beams to frequencies that travel long distances through the atmosphere. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based laser systems powerful enough to disable satellites in orbit. The development addresses a key technical hurdle—self-damage to optical components—that has historically limited the power and range of directed-energy weapons.</p>

This public promotion of his own brand while in office is highly unusual for a sitting president.
