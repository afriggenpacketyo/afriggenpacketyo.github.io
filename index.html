          <h2>Parenting Expert Cautions Against Overusing 'You're Okay' Phrase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 09:44:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting coach warns that the common phrase "you're okay," while intended to be comforting, can be damaging to children's emotional development. According to the coach, this phrase teaches children to doubt their feelings, invalidates their experiences, and interrupts emotional processing. Over time, this can rewire a child's stress response and make it harder to trust, regulate emotions, and feel safe expressing themselves. Instead, parents should validate their children's emotions and provide support.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identifies college majors that tend to result in the lowest median incomes five years after graduation. Education, social work, and arts majors are among those with the lowest earning potential, often falling below the U.S. median wage. While a college degree generally leads to better pay, the analysis shows that certain fields may not guarantee high salaries, particularly in the liberal arts.</p>
