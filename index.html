        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xpeng's Hong Kong-listed shares experienced a significant surge, climbing over 10% following the release of upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter, with analysts projecting profitability by the fourth quarter of 2025. The Guangzhou-based electric vehicle manufacturer reported a doubling of first-quarter revenue, driven by robust sales, and a narrowed net loss compared to the previous year, alongside an improved gross margin. Analysts at UOB Kay Hian maintain a buy rating on the stock, anticipating a strong product cycle to continue driving sales and projecting a target price with substantial upside from its current level. The company has been working on expanding overseas.</p>

          <p>Two young Israeli Embassy aides were fatally shot outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington D.C., with the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, expressing solidarity with Palestine after being detained, according to law enforcement officials.

Israeli Ambassador Yechiel Leiter identified the victims as a young couple about to be engaged, and President Trump condemned the killings as antisemitic.

          <p>The Indiana Pacers, channeling the spirit of Reggie Miller, mounted an improbable comeback to defeat the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers in the fourth quarter ignited the Pacers' rally from a 17-point deficit, while Tyrese Haliburton's buzzer-beater sent the game into overtime. Despite Jalen Brunson's 43 points, the Knicks couldn't hold off the Pacers, who secured their first lead since the second quarter with a late 5-0 run. The Knicks are hoping to win the series, as they previously did in the series where Miller hit them with his choke signal.</p>

          <p>Martin Kettle argues that the UK is increasingly divided economically and politically, posing a threat to its stability, and that public confidence in the government is at record lows. He discusses Keir Starmer's efforts to address these divisions, including the Council of the Nations and Regions, which aims to foster partnership between the UK government and devolved administrations. Kettle notes the challenges Starmer faces, including a resurgent SNP in Scotland and the rise of Reform UK in England, which complicate efforts at collaboration. He emphasizes the importance of collaboration for achieving policy goals and restoring public confidence in politics.</p>

          <p>An independent sentencing review in the UK suggests that violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence, contingent on good behavior. The review, chaired by former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, aims to address severe prison overcrowding by managing more offenders in the community and reducing short custodial sentences. The report also proposes increased funding for the Probation Service and greater use of electronic monitoring, drawing inspiration from Texas's "earned progression model." However, probation officers express concerns about the added pressure on an already strained system, while former prisoners emphasize the need for adequate community support.</p>

          <p>Richard Poplak, a journalist based in Johannesburg, critiques the narrative promoted by figures like Ernst Roets and amplified by Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump, which alleges that white Afrikaners in South Africa are victims of genocide. Poplak argues that there is no evidence to support claims of systematic civil rights violations or disproportionate violence against white landowners, who still control a significant portion of the country's land. He explains that while South Africa faces challenges like inequality and crime, the notion of a government-sponsored campaign against white farmers is a falsehood used to rewrite the country's history. The article highlights how Afrikaner lobbyists have exploited MAGA culture to elevate their cause.</p>

          <p>One year after their general election victory, the Labour government is employing a strategy of blaming the Conservatives for current challenges, including issues with the Chagos Islands handover and prison overcrowding. The government points to the previous administration's failure to secure a deal on the Chagos Islands and accuses them of neglecting prison infrastructure, leading to the current crisis. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is considering mandatory chemical castration for sexual offenders, and new data is expected on net migration and asylum seeker housing.

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers granted to California, a controversial action Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than the federal government, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers through the Congressional Review Act, while Democrats contend this move sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state's waivers have resulted in significant pollution reduction and vows to sue if the federal government proceeds.</p>

Scientists Konstantin Batygin and Fred Adams analyzed the orbital motions of Jupiter's moons, Amalthea and Thebe, to reconstruct the planet's early evolution. Their findings support the bottom-up method of planet formation, indicating a period of rapid, intense growth early in the solar system's history.

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is completely down, leaving users unable to browse, as the retailer continues to grapple with the aftermath of a cyberattack that occurred last month. The retailer estimates the cyber-attack will hit this year's profits by around ¬£300m and that its online services would continue to be disrupted until July. The company said that some personal customer data was stolen in the cyber attack, which could include telephone numbers, home addresses and dates of birth. Police are focusing on a notorious group of English-speaking hackers, known as Scattered Spider.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled House is poised to vote on President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill, following weeks of internal disagreements over spending cuts. The bill, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases spending on military and immigration enforcement, faces opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans concerned about its impact on the national debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the US's debt over the next decade. The bill proposes tightening eligibility for food and health programs to offset costs, but faces significant hurdles in the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies are creating uncertainty for India, which has been working to attract manufacturing away from China, particularly from companies like Apple. Despite India's efforts to reduce tariffs and provide infrastructure support, Trump has suggested Apple should move production to the United States instead. This demand is a setback for India, which has been promoting itself as a viable alternative to China for American businesses. Indian officials remain hopeful for a trade agreement but are unsure of the path forward amidst Trump's shifting tactics and demands.</p>

The funds would be invested on the child's behalf and could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house.

          <p>During a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Trump claimed there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa, a claim that has been widely refuted by officials and a South African court. While murders of farmers do occur in South Africa, statistics do not indicate that these are race-driven, and the country's crime statistics do not differentiate between the races of victims. The White House released a statement doubling down on Trump's claims, pointing to articles from conservative news outlets, while South Africa's Presidential Spokesperson denied any evidence of genocide.</p>

This action highlights the EU's commitment to maintaining the network's operations amid the Trump administration's efforts to undermine its finances and independence.

The government subsidy intends to decrease the wholesale gasoline price gradually, with a targeted reduction of 10 yen by mid-June.
