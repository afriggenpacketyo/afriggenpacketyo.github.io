          <p>Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, was executed in Florida for the 1994 sexual assault and murder of Michelle McGrath. Gudinas was convicted in 1995 and his appeals were rejected by the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. Gudinas's lawyers argued that evidence related to "lifelong mental illnesses" exempted him from being put to death, but the Florida Supreme Court denied the appeals. He is the seventh person put to death in Florida this year, with an eighth scheduled for next month, making 2025 the year with the most executions since 2015. </p>

The new guidelines list scenarios for drone use, including high-risk incidents, investigations, large-scale events, and natural disasters, transferring their command to the Office of Special Operations. Officials claim community support and reassure that the policy will not be used unconstitutionally, with a pilot program set to launch next month in four police divisions.

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a bill that would force the USPS to sell its new electric vehicle mail delivery trucks and cancel the contract for the remaining vehicles. Republicans argue this would cut costs and focus the USPS on delivering mail rather than environmental initiatives, but the Senate parliamentarian found that disposing of the USPS EVs violates the Byrd Rule. The USPS says replacing the revoked vehicles would cost over $450 million, and the potential for raising money at auction is negligible. The Postal Service says this action would seriously cripple their ability to replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet. (not investment advice)</p>

The dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago and will be the first new dinosaur to go on display at the Natural History Museum in London since 2014. Scientists determined it was a new species by examining the leg bones and comparing it to the original Nanosaurus specimen. The discovery helps scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs in the Late Jurassic period and how small dinosaurs evolved into larger ones.</p>

Concerns are also raised about the ultra-processed nature of lab-grown meat and its potential control by multinational companies. Singapore, the US, and Israel have already approved the sale of lab-grown meat, but mass production and affordability remain challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines how voters and politicians now treat scandal as just another factor in a cost-benefit analysis, rather than a simple disqualifier. The shift is illustrated by Andrew Cuomo's mayoral run despite past sexual harassment accusations and undercounting COVID deaths. Several factors contribute to this trend, including a shift in public views on sex scandals, the sheer number of accusations against politicians, and the polarized, partisan landscape of politics. While scandals can still hurt a politician, voters may be more willing to overlook them if they believe the candidate is more electable or if they strongly oppose their rival's worldview.</p>

          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, alleges that senior officials discussed defying federal court orders and withholding information from judges to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities. Reuveni says he was put on leave and then fired after pushing back against attempts to defy immigration-related court orders. The allegations include a claim that Emil Bove, a top Justice Department official, suggested the department "would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order." Reuveni's attorneys say the consequences of these actions have grave impacts on the safety and rights of individuals.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the Trump administration's postponement of a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, calling it "outrageous," "evasive," and "derelict." The briefing was postponed to allow for Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to attend. Schumer said senators deserve full transparency and real information, not just political talking points. The delay came as an early intelligence assessment showed the attack did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program and likely set it back only by months.</p>

If the relegation stands, Lyon will be replaced by Reims in the top flight. Lyon reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2020 and have not played in the second tier since 1989.</p>
