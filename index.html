          <p>In a New York Times opinion piece, Thomas Friedman asserts that President Trump's governing style is characterized by unchecked gut impulses, lacking homework and interagency coordination. Friedman suggests this approach could lead to disastrous outcomes, highlighting the potential risks of impulsive decision-making in governance. The article emphasizes the importance of informed and coordinated strategies in effective leadership, especially in complex political landscapes. The author warns that such a chaotic and unplanned approach to governance may result in severe negative consequences. </p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of ship names, including the USNS Harvey Milk, potentially stripping the name of the gay rights pioneer as a rebuke of Pride Month. CBS News obtained documents showing proposed timelines for the name change, with other vessels named after civil rights leaders also under consideration for renaming. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have condemned the move as a shameful erasure of those who fought to break down barriers. The USNS Harvey Milk, a John Lewis-class replenishment oiler, was christened in 2021 and represented a significant step toward inclusivity within the armed forces. </p>

          <p>At least 27 Palestinians were killed and 161 wounded while attempting to reach a food distribution center in Gaza run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. The Israeli military stated its troops fired warning shots near the aid hub after identifying suspects deviating from designated access routes. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called the situation "unconscionable" and demanded a prompt investigation into the deaths. The GHF has distributed over 7 million meals since starting operations, but the UN warns of a high risk of starvation in Gaza, with concerns raised about the militarized aid distribution system. </p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren's office has released a report detailing Elon Musk's "130 days" in President Trump's administration, alleging he used his role to benefit himself and his businesses. The report outlines over 100 instances where Musk purportedly abused his position as a "special government employee" overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). It accuses Musk of violating ethical norms and raising questions about corruption and conflicts of interest. Musk led DOGE in an effort to slash federal government spending, but the report suggests his actions were motivated by personal gain. </p>

          <p>An 88-year-old woman in the Czech Republic, initially declared dead by a coroner after being found unresponsive, was discovered to be alive while being placed in a coffin. Morticians made the startling discovery, prompting an ambulance to transport her to the hospital. This rare medical occurrence, known as the Lazarus Effect, involves a person showing signs of life after being clinically pronounced dead. The Cleveland Clinic notes that this phenomenon typically occurs after CPR ends, and there have been 74 confirmed cases in the U.S. from 1982 to 2022. </p>

Kennedy's directive excluded pregnant women from the recommendations, despite concerns about their higher risk of severe COVID-19.

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed an interim step in Iran nuclear talks that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels. This proposal aims to create a framework while a broader arrangement is worked out to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The interim agreement would allow some enrichment while establishing safeguards to block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. This approach reflects ongoing diplomatic efforts to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program. </p>

          <p>A 4-year-old Mexican girl receiving lifesaving medical care in Southern California has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother parole for one year, allowing her to continue treatment for short bowel syndrome. The decision reverses earlier notifications that their parole was being revoked, potentially subjecting them to deportation. The girl receives intravenous nutrition through a special backpack, a treatment necessary for her survival that is unavailable in Mexico. </p>
