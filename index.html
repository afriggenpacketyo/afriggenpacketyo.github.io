          <h2>Samsung Electronics Forecasts Over 50% Drop in Second-Quarter Profits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 21:32:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics anticipates its second-quarter operating profit will fall by 56% year-over-year, significantly missing analyst expectations. The decline is attributed to struggles in the memory chip sector, particularly in supplying high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips for AI applications, where competitors like SK Hynix have gained an edge with major clients like Nvidia. The company's foundry business also faces weak orders and intense competition, contributing to the disappointing financial outlook and a drop in its share price following the announcement.

          <p>The upcoming WNBA game between the Indiana Fever and the Dallas Wings is being moved to the American Airlines Center, which has a capacity of around 20,000, to accommodate immense fan interest. This decision reflects the significant draw of rookie stars Caitlin Clark of the Fever and Paige Bueckers of the Wings, whose previous matchup also sold out the larger venue. While Clark's participation is uncertain due to a recent injury, the move highlights the growing popularity and commercial power of the league's new talent.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology is severing ties with e-learning provider Simplilearn after a class-action lawsuit alleged the university misrepresented its connection to a cybersecurity boot camp. The suit claimed CalTech lent its prestigious name to a program that had minimal ties to its faculty and misled students about its quality. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students and implement more transparent practices, a move seen as a significant victory for consumer protection in the online education industry.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from the Los Angeles Times criticizes the Trump administration's priorities, contrasting increased funding for ICE and Border Patrol with budget cuts for medical and climate science. The article points to a recent show of force by federal agents in L.A.'s MacArthur Park as an example of a "political agenda of provoking fear." The author argues that while immigration is being treated as the nation's greatest threat, critical areas like the National Institutes of Health and the National Weather Service are being defunded, posing a greater long-term risk to public health and safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating the country must be able to defend itself against Russian aggression. This decision reverses a temporary pause on some weapons shipments that was confirmed by the White House just last week, a move reportedly made over concerns about depleting U.S. military stockpiles. The announcement followed recent phone calls between Trump and both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with Trump expressing disappointment in his lack of progress with Putin.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have eliminated up to 80,000 jobs. The VA now states that staff reductions achieved through a federal hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition have made the mass layoffs unnecessary. The department expects to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through these measures.

While the types of storms may differ, California's topography and history of floods and debris flows mean it could experience similarly catastrophic impacts, particularly from intense atmospheric rivers. Projections show flood risks are increasing due to climate change. Although California is considered to have stronger building regulations in floodways, many communities and homeless populations living along rivers remain highly vulnerable to sudden, dangerous inundations.</p>

          <p>Seraphine, the high-end maternity fashion retailer famously worn by Catherine, Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration. The company, which had struggled with "fragile consumer confidence" and rising costs, has made the majority of its 95 staff redundant. Administrators are now exploring options for the business and its assets, including a potential sale of the brand. The collapse marks a sharp downturn for the retailer, which had reached a peak in popularity and even listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2021.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to release the first part of its final report, which will focus on the human impact and compensation for victims. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system in one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice. While these initial findings will address the adequacy of redress schemes, the second part of the report, which will assign blame, is not expected until at least 2026, meaning a long wait for full accountability continues.</p>

The event aims to reinforce a crucial partnership on security, particularly regarding support for Ukraine, and to find common ground on contentious issues like stopping illegal small boat crossings, highlighting the King's significant role in "soft power" diplomacy.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting they are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than fixed policy. He noted the administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and believes the ultimate goal is to increase U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, Cramer argued that if the tariffs are indeed a negotiating ploy, they may not significantly impact inflation or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions as much as some fear.

          <p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism after it was reported he was vacationing in Greece as his state was being devastated by deadly floods.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that U.S. foreign and defense policy is currently being run without coherent leadership from the top of the Trump administration. The article suggests that with the President's interest being "capricious and episodic," key decisions are either not being made or are being driven by lower-level, unelected officials like Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby. This creates a dysfunctional process akin to an authoritarian state, where on most issues, "no one is in charge," leaving the nation's security in the hands of unknown appointees with their own agendas.</p>
