          <p>Parts of the southeastern United States are actively bracing for the significant impacts of a potential tropical storm, designated Tropical Depression 9, which is expected to make landfall early next week. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has already declared a state of emergency, warning residents of substantial wind, heavy rainfall, and widespread flooding across the entire state. The storm system is currently intensifying over the Caribbean and could potentially strengthen to hurricane intensity by the time it approaches the U.S. coast. This preparation follows previous years of intense storm seasons, with climate change contributing to more frequent and powerful hurricanes in the region.</p>

          <p>Representative Ashley Hinson, an Iowa Republican, has voiced strong concerns after her teen son's high school aired segments on its student-run television program promoting "Bisexual Plus Awareness Week." Hinson criticized the school for what she deemed inappropriate sexual content being broadcast to minors without parental knowledge or consent. As a result, she is calling for a federal investigation by the Department of Education and collaborating with the Governor to ensure accountability. The Linn-Mar Community School District is currently reviewing whether any existing policies were violated, while Hinson argues the school is "indoctrinating" rather than educating students.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning Amelia Earhart, the pioneering aviator whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has fueled decades of public fascination and speculation. While the prevailing theory suggests Earhart's plane crashed due to running out of fuel, various alternative theories, including a spy mission or capture by the Japanese, have long circulated. A lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. However, experts largely dismiss these alternative narratives, maintaining the high probability of a fuel-related crash.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired between 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling at a racial justice protest following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Media reports indicate that the termination letters cited a "lack of judgment" in their actions during the demonstration. The FBI Agents Association has publicly condemned these dismissals, arguing that the agents' rights were violated and that such politically motivated actions ultimately weaken the Bureau's operational effectiveness. This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to purge what it perceives as "left-wing" policies and officials from various federal agencies, sparking renewed debate over free expression within law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace delivered a truly commanding performance to defeat Liverpool 2-1, impressively extending their unbeaten streak to 18 games across all competitions and decisively exposing Liverpool's persistent defensive vulnerabilities. Ismaila Sarr netted an early goal, and substitute Eddie Nketiah secured a deserved winner in the 97th minute, dramatically responding to Liverpool's late equalizer. This historic victory, marking their first at home against Liverpool since 2014, propelled Palace to an impressive second place in the Premier League, just three points behind the reigning champions.

          <p>England's Red Roses delivered a dominant and assured performance to defeat Canada 33-13 at Twickenham, thereby securing their third Women's Rugby World Cup title. This momentous victory occurred in front of a record-breaking crowd of 81,885, laying to rest the ghost of previous final losses to New Zealand. Key tries from Ellie Kildunne, Amy Cokayne, Alex Matthews, and Abbie Ward firmly cemented England's control throughout the match. The triumph caps an already memorable year for women's sport in England, following the Lionesses' successful retention of their European football title earlier in July.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has launched a strong attack on Reform UK, warning that their proposed policies, particularly the plan to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, would fundamentally "tear this country apart." Ahead of the Labour party conference in Liverpool, Starmer aimed to position Labour as a patriotic alternative to what he termed Reform's "toxic divide and decline." He further criticized Reform leader Nigel Farage as "unpatriotic" for allegedly speaking negatively about the country while abroad. This intensified political rhetoric comes at a time when opinion polls show Labour trailing Reform UK, escalating the ongoing political debate in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to deploy federal troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing "full force" to protect ICE facilities from what he described as "Antifa and other domestic terrorists." This contentious move expands his administration's efforts to confront perceived political violence, following similar deployments in other U.S. cities. Oregon's Governor and Portland's Mayor swiftly criticized the decision, asserting there is no national security threat in their city and calling for residents to remain calm. Legal experts also questioned the designation of Antifa as a domestic terror organization, citing potential constitutional challenges under the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>An article analyzes how former President Donald Trump's unprecedented openness about actions typically concealed by politicians is profoundly reshaping the public's perception of political scandal. Observers suggest this brazen approach paradoxically earns him credit for authenticity while simultaneously desensitizing the audience to issues that historically ended political careers. Examples cited include his direct appeals to the Attorney General regarding political opponents and his past controversial statements. Critics argue this behavior normalizes misconduct and erodes the rule of law, whereas supporters often view it as genuine and a challenge to a rigged system, making him relatable to his base.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas resulted in one death and two critical injuries, with the FBI investigating the incident as a targeted attack. The shooter, identified as Joshua Jahn, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and the deceased victim was identified as detainee Norlan Guzman Fuentes. Evidence, including anti-ICE messages engraved on shell casings, strongly suggests a motive rooted in hatred towards the agency. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric, and has ordered immediate increases in security at ICE facilities nationwide.</p>

DW Fact check thoroughly debunked these claims, citing extensive scientific research that unequivocally confirms the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in significantly reducing HPV infections and precancerous lesions.

This significant settlement follows a similar confidential agreement recently reached with another former Trump attorney, Sidney Powell, who was also sued for leading a pervasive campaign of false election theories.

          <p>A groundbreaking new study published in Science reveals that chimpanzees regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from naturally fermented fruit in the wild, ingesting a daily dose equivalent to approximately one small bottle of beer for humans. Researchers observed chimps consuming fruits with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, suggesting that regular alcohol consumption may possess deeper evolutionary roots than previously understood. This compelling finding supports the idea that human alcohol use is not solely a cultural phenomenon but could be rooted in our shared evolutionary history. The study, building on previous research, indicates that alcohol consumption is far more common among wild animals than once believed.</p>

          <p>The Danish Defense Ministry has reported new drone sightings at several defense facilities overnight, following a series of similar incidents earlier this week that temporarily disrupted Danish airports. Drone activity was specifically observed at Skrydstrup Air Base and the Jutland Dragoon Regiment, with local media also reporting sightings near the military Karup Air Base. These unexplained and repeated incidents have significantly raised security concerns across northern Europe, especially after similar events in neighboring Norway and recent Russian incursions into other NATO airspace. NATO has publicly pledged a "resolute response" to such "reckless behavior," emphasizing strengthened air defense capabilities in the Baltic Sea region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse lower court injunctions and uphold its executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship in the U.S. This controversial order, signed in January, denies citizenship to children born to migrants who are either in the country illegally or on temporary visas, a policy the administration asserts is vital for national border security. Opponents vigorously contend that this executive action directly violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, which grants citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." The legal challenge hinges on the interpretation of "subject to the jurisdiction thereof," with the administration seeking a definitive resolution in the Supreme Court's upcoming term.</p>

          <p>After more than three decades, Austin police have finally identified Robert Eugene Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, as a suspect in the infamous 1991 murders of four teenage girls at a Texas yogurt shop. The victims—Amy Ayers, Eliza Thomas, and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison—were tragically bound, gagged, shot, and the shop subsequently set on fire, with at least one girl having been sexually assaulted. DNA testing ultimately led to Brashers, who possessed a lengthy criminal history involving violent crimes. The case, which saw previous wrongful convictions, remains an open investigation, but this breakthrough offers a significant step towards closure for the deeply affected families after years of tireless investigative work.</p>

          <p>A group of Minneapolis friends has become central figures in the fight against AI-generated explicit imagery after discovering their social media photos were used to create deepfake content on a "nudify" site. Jessica Guistolise and Molly Kelley learned of these disturbing deepfakes through an acquaintance, highlighting the alarming ease and accessibility of such AI tools. Despite filing police reports, they encountered limited legal recourse because the images had not been publicly distributed, only existing on a personal computer. This personal experience spurred them to advocate for stronger legislation, leading Minnesota State Senator Erin Maye Quade to introduce a bill aimed at holding AI companies accountable for creating nonconsensual explicit deepfakes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced steep new tariffs, effective October 1, 2025, imposing a 100% duty on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports unless companies commit to building manufacturing plants in the U.S. This significant policy shift, communicated via social media, explicitly exempts generic drugs and firms that have already begun U.S. construction. While some pharmaceutical giants have pledged domestic investment, experts widely anticipate considerable confusion over the precise exemption criteria and a substantial increase in costs for American patients. Critics argue these tariffs will severely disrupt supply chains and potentially limit access to life-saving treatments, with major exporters like Ireland, Germany, and Switzerland facing significant economic implications.

          <p>Robert Cary McNair Jr., the son of Houston Texans co-founders, has filed a lawsuit against the National Football League for "tortious interference," alleging a concerted conspiracy between the NFL and his brother, Cal McNair. The lawsuit claims that the NFL deliberately intervened in the McNair family business to remove McNair Jr. from his CEO position and systematically exclude him from meaningful roles. This alleged action, according to the complaint, aimed to silence him after he raised questions about player scandals that "potentially implicated the NFL, its personnel, and its decision-making process." The lawsuit seeks over $60 million in damages, contending the NFL orchestrated a restructuring of the family trust to install Cal McNair as the owner's representative.</p>

Zervos, a CNBC contributor, argues that the Fed should prioritize the labor market over inflation, citing AI experts who predict a loss of three to five million jobs in the next few years.
