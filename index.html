          <p>Two survivors of grooming gang abuse have resigned from a national inquiry panel in the UK, expressing concerns about the inquiry's direction and leadership. Fiona Goddard, one of the survivors, cited the selection of a former police chief and a social worker as potential chairs, services she believes failed victims in the past. Her resignation letter also mentioned a "toxic, fearful environment" and attempts to water down the inquiry's focus, prompting calls from politicians for a senior judge to lead the investigation to ensure impartiality and restore faith in the process.</p>

          <p>In response to a new critical minerals agreement between the United States and Australia, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that resource-rich nations should play a proactive role in stabilizing global supply chains. A spokesperson emphasized that the formation of these industrial chains results from market forces and corporate choices, not geopolitical maneuvering. This statement follows the announcement of a US-Australia deal aimed at countering Beijing's dominance in the rare earths market, and shortly after China itself imposed stricter export controls on these critical minerals and related technologies.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Australian rare earths and critical minerals companies experienced initial surges before retreating, following the announcement of a minerals deal with the United States valued at up to $8.5 billion. While some smaller miners held onto their gains, larger firms like Lynas Rare Earths saw their early rallies reverse. The agreement aims to bolster supply chains for materials crucial for defense and energy sectors, partly as a response to China's export controls. The deal includes significant investment and the development of a pricing framework to stabilize volatile global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following the resignation of Shigeru Ishiba. Her election was secured through a new coalition between her Liberal Democratic Party and the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. A protégée of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the pacifist constitution. Despite the historic appointment, she is not a proponent of gender equality measures, opposing same-sex marriage and separate surnames for married couples.</p>

          <p>Amazon has resolved a major outage of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform that caused widespread disruptions across the internet for most of a day. The issue, which Amazon attributed to its domain name system (DNS), affected thousands of online services, including social media, gaming, streaming, and financial platforms. The disruption impacted major companies and even Amazon's own services like Ring and Alexa, highlighting modern society's dependence on a small number of large cloud providers for critical internet infrastructure, which operated reliably until the sudden failure.</p>

The challenge comes after Trump publicly criticized Massie as a "Weak and Pathetic RINO" and praised Gallrein as a "Brave Combat Veteran."

          <p>The recent massive internet outage was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error within Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing giant that underpins about a third of the internet. A DNS acts as the internet's address book, and when it failed at AWS's largest data center in Virginia, it could no longer direct user traffic to countless websites and apps. This event underscored the significant risk of centralizing critical internet infrastructure with a few major providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as a single failure can have cascading effects across the global digital economy.</p>

Thieves escaped with eight valuable items in a robbery that took approximately eight minutes. Experts believe the professional gang will dismantle the pieces, melting down the gold and cutting the large gemstones into smaller, untraceable stones to be sold for a fraction of their true value. While French police have launched a major investigation, the prospect of recovering the historic items intact is considered increasingly unlikely as time passes.</p>

          <p>As the new NBA season approaches, sports analysts are making their predictions, with many eyes on Victor Wembanyama, who is a popular pick for MVP after showing flashes of his immense potential. Other key storylines include Kevin Durant's move to the Houston Rockets, which is expected to elevate the young team into a serious contender. The Eastern Conference is seen as wide open due to long-term injuries to stars like Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton. Bold predictions include the Oklahoma City Thunder potentially winning 70 games and the Los Angeles Lakers missing the playoffs entirely.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Protein Weakness That Could Aid in Prostate Cancer Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 02:00:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative research team from China and Australia has identified a potential new strategy for fighting prostate cancer by targeting two specific protein enzymes. These enzymes are crucial for helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist treatment by regulating the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which fuels the disease's progression. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uncover a key mechanism that could lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches. Prostate cancer is a significant global health issue, with an estimated 1.5 million new diagnoses each year worldwide.</p>

          <p>Australian scientists have discovered several new deep-sea species, including a tiny, bioluminescent lantern shark and a semi-transparent porcelain crab, in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia. The West Australian Lantern Shark grows up to 40cm and has a glowing belly, while the newly found porcelain crab is about the size of an almond. These discoveries were part of a research voyage that has so far unearthed about 20 new species, with researchers estimating that hundreds more specimens collected have yet to be formally described, highlighting how much of the ocean remains unexplored.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At China's Canton Fair, exporters are observing a growing trend of international clients requesting to use the yuan for trade settlements, particularly from countries in Southeast Asia and Central Asia. One company reported that yuan-settled orders now constitute 10 to 20 percent of its total exports, a significant increase from last year. This shift is partly driven by the expansion of Chinese-led infrastructure projects abroad, such as data centers in Singapore and Malaysia, which create a natural ecosystem for using the Chinese currency. The trend reflects Beijing's ongoing efforts to promote the internationalization of the yuan.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is facing a crisis of form after suffering four consecutive losses, dropping to fourth in the Premier League table. Despite a summer spending spree of nearly £450 million, manager Arne Slot is struggling to find his best starting eleven, with expensive signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak failing to make a significant impact. Key issues plaguing the team include a lack of goals from star forward Mohamed Salah, an unsettled defense, and a midfield that appears lethargic. The club must address these problems quickly to avoid a fifth straight defeat for the first time since 1953.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Russian soldiers are reportedly stranded in a perilous situation on a chain of islands in the Dnipro river delta, facing starvation and constant attacks from Ukrainian forces. The area, which has become a de facto front line south of Kherson, is described as a "death zone" by Ukrainian military officials, with nowhere for the troops to hide. Ukrainian drones monitor the labyrinth of marshes, targeting any attempts by the soldiers to escape in small boats. The conditions have made resupply and troop rotation exceptionally difficult for Russia, leading to significant losses and desperate survival situations.</p>

          <p>A new project called "Reefline" is set to create a seven-mile-long artificial reef and underwater art installation off the coast of Miami Beach. The reef will be composed of a series of sculptures made from marine-grade concrete, including an installation of 22 concrete cars arranged in a traffic jam, which will serve as habitats for marine life. The project aims to restore the area's coral habitat, which was lost decades ago, by transplanting resilient local coral species onto the structures. Funded by the city and private donations, Reefline will also function as an ecotourism attraction accessible to snorkelers.</p>

          <h2>Illinois and Chicago Ask Supreme Court to Block National Guard Deployment</h2>

          <p>Lawyers for the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a lower court's order that prevents the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard into Chicago. In their brief, they argue that the administration's request relies on "mischaracterizations" of the situation on the ground and that state and local law enforcement are capable of handling protest activities. The current order allows for the federalization of the Illinois National Guard but bars their deployment within the city, a balance they argue respects the constitutional division of power over the militia.</p>
