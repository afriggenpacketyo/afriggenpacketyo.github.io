          <h2>Aluminum Sector Struggles in the U.S. Despite Tariffs Due to High Energy Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 06:15:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite tariffs on imported aluminum intended to boost domestic production, the U.S. aluminum sector is facing challenges due to high electricity prices. These rising costs, particularly compared to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The tariffs are causing higher prices for U.S. consumers as companies pass through the increased costs, but domestic smelting is not reviving because U.S. smelters lack access to competitively priced, long-term power contracts. Competition with the tech sector for energy resources further exacerbates the issue, making it difficult for aluminum producers to secure affordable power for their energy-intensive processes.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin led Russia's Victory Day commemorations with a parade in Red Square, joined by China's Xi Jinping, signaling strengthened ties between the two countries. Putin used the occasion to link the war to today's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and said all of Russia was behind what he called the "special military operation" - now well into its fourth year. Xi's presence, along with Chinese soldiers marching in the parade, highlighted Russia's pivot to the east, further emphasized by military contingents from North Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia. This display of unity occurred amidst heightened security in Moscow following Ukrainian strikes, with Russia announcing a unilateral ceasefire, which Ukraine rejected.</p>

          <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been suspended for a week due to escalating conflict between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, a disputed territory. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) cited the need to act in the collective interest of stakeholders, expressing solidarity with the Indian government and armed forces. The Pakistan Cricket Board has also moved the remaining matches of its Pakistan Super League (PSL) to the United Arab Emirates, citing security concerns after claims that an Indian drone fell inside a stadium complex. The conflict has impacted cricketing relations, with teams not facing each other outside of global events and social media accounts of prominent players being blocked.</p>

Agreement on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs.

Animal behavior is shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including genetics, environment, and learning, and he believes that all those factors should be taken into account. The question of whether animals have awareness of their actions is also explored, suggesting that many behaviors are habitual and procedural, similar to human habits like brushing teeth.</p>

          <p>Experts are concerned about President Trump's cuts to federal funding for addiction treatment programs in Los Angeles County, which could jeopardize progress made in reducing fatal opioid overdoses. Preliminary data shows a decrease in overdose deaths in L.A. County, attributed to harm reduction efforts like increased naloxone availability. However, these efforts are threatened by the funding cuts, while local authorities are re-embracing stricter penalties for drug offenders.

The poll also found that most Californians support requiring a government ID every time a voter casts a ballot, though by a slimmer majority and despite most Democrats opposing the idea.

          <p>In response to recent ICE raids on restaurants associated with political figures, a contributor argues that law enforcement has become increasingly politicized, particularly under the Obama and Biden administrations. The author suggests that the Trump administration targeting political opponents is not a significant departure from this trend, and that both sides of the political divide must accept a paradigm of mutually assured destruction to restore normalcy. The key question is how to undo the damage and restore left-right prosecutorial and law enforcement relations to the pre-Obama status quo. A short-term escalation may be necessary to reach a long-term stasis.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Mother's Day, the White House is considering policies to boost the U.S. birth rate, including a baby bonus, but evidence suggests such bonuses have mixed results. Paid parental leave and expanded public child care are more effective in increasing birth rates and improving maternal health. A renewed expansion of the child tax credit would be a simple first step, as it allows some parents to stay home with their children and subsidize child care for those who work, drastically cutting the child poverty rate. Investing in mothers from pregnancy through childbirth and across the years of raising children is what will make a real difference.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent rhetoric about Americans needing fewer toys and pencils is being seen as an attempt to sell scarcity as a virtue, normalizing the consequences of his tariff policies. Critics argue that Trump, a wealthy figure, is an unlikely messenger for austerity, and that his message conflicts with his past promises to lower prices. The comments are viewed as damage control, attempting to recast inflation as moral clarity and consumer scarcity as character building. This approach is considered un-American, as it involves the government telling people what they need, rather than offering more choices.</p>
