          <p>Google Cloud experienced widespread global outages on Thursday, impacting various cloud-based services and causing disruptions for numerous users. The outages, which began in the late morning, affected several Google Cloud products across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. This incident is a setback for Google, which is striving to compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the cloud infrastructure market, particularly as demand for AI products and services grows. Services such as Amazon's Twitch, CoreWeave's Weights and Biases, Elastic, GitLab, LangChain, Microsoft's GitHub, Replit, Intuit's Mailchimp, Shopify, and Cloudflare were also affected, but Cloudflare confirmed the issue stemmed from Google Cloud. The situation prompted a spike in searches for "Firebase," a Google developer platform. </p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is aiming to move forward from the controversy surrounding David Hogg, who announced he would not seek re-election as vice chair after internal disagreements arose from his efforts to primary older incumbent Democrats. The DNC voted to redo the vice-chair election, leading to Hogg's decision to step back, allowing the party to refocus on more pressing matters. DNC Chair Ken Martin thanked Hogg for his activism but acknowledged the need to address the distractions caused by the internal conflict. The controversy stemmed from Hogg's pledge to support primary challenges against older House Democrats, which led to an ultimatum from Martin to either rescind his vice-chair position or forego his political influence. </p>

Padilla stated he was trying to obtain information about DHS's immigration enforcement actions in the LA area. Following his removal, Padilla claimed he was forced to the ground and handcuffed but not detained or arrested. The incident sparked immediate reactions from politicians, with Gov.

The bill's cuts to Medicaid and food stamps are cited as reasons for the reduced resources for low-income individuals. In contrast, the CBO found that the bill would boost government resources for the highest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $12,000 per year. President Trump has urged lawmakers to support the budget measure, while critics argue that the legislation favors the wealthy at the expense of vulnerable households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of a 16th-century merchant ship more than 1.5 miles underwater off the coast of southern France, the deepest such find in French waters. The ship, believed to be sailing from northern Italy, was found by chance by an underwater drone during a military operation to explore the seabed. The wreck site, dubbed "Camarat 4," is largely preserved intact due to its depth, which prevented looting. The discovery includes ceramics, metal bars, cannons, and other artifacts, offering a unique opportunity to study a 16th-century wreck. </p>
