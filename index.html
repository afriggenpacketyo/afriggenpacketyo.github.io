          <p>China's industrial profits saw a second consecutive month of growth in April, accelerating from 2.6% in March to 3%, despite ongoing U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. This improvement is largely attributed to Beijing's policy measures aimed at supporting businesses, particularly in the private sector, which offset some of the tariff impacts. High-tech manufacturing, including biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing, experienced significant profit increases. However, certain sectors like automobiles and apparel faced headwinds due to price competition and shifting demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by Chinese group Geely Holding, is set to cut around 3,000 white-collar jobs, primarily impacting office-based positions in Sweden, as part of cost-cutting measures. CEO Håkan Samuelsson cited the "challenging period" faced by the global motor industry, including U.S. tariffs, higher material costs, and slower sales in Europe, as reasons for the layoffs. This move follows Volvo's earlier announcement to scale back its ambition for all-electric cars by 2030 due to various uncertainties, including tariffs. The broader industry faces cutthroat rivalry, with Chinese EV giant BYD recently announcing price cuts.</p>

Six people have also been arrested and charged for assisting two of the escaped inmates. The escape occurred on May 16 after the inmates removed a toilet and sink, cut steel bars, and exited through a loading dock, with officials suspecting internal assistance.
