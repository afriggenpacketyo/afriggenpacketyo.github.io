        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has formally summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen following credible reports that American citizens are conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. These alleged activities are aimed at promoting Greenland's secession from Denmark and fostering closer ties with the United States, a proposition Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has unequivocally declared "unacceptable." This diplomatic incident is set against a backdrop of previous statements by US President Trump, who has openly expressed a desire to annex the autonomous Danish territory, and earlier reports of US spy agencies focusing on Greenland's independence movement. The Danish government remains vigilant about sustained external attempts to influence the Kingdom's internal affairs and Greenland's strategic future, emphasizing the seriousness of such interference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US President Donald Trump has implemented a broad program of tariffs, taxes on imported goods, with particularly high rates on countries with political grievances. Trump argues these tariffs protect American jobs and manufacturing, aiming to reduce the trade deficit, though critics say his policy creates global economic volatility and raises consumer prices. A US trade court initially challenged his authority to impose some tariffs under national emergency powers, but an appeals court allowed them to remain. The article details specific tariffs on goods like steel, aluminum, and cars, as well as varying rates applied to countries like India, Brazil, and Japan, while the UK secured a lower 10% rate. This complex, evolving strategy reflects Trump's use of trade policy as a negotiating tactic to secure deals beneficial to the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two police officers, Detective Neal Thompson (59) and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart (35), were fatally shot in Porepunkah, Australia, while executing a warrant for alleged sexual offences. A third officer was seriously injured but is recovering. A massive manhunt is ongoing for the suspect, 56-year-old Dezi Freeman, who is heavily armed and familiar with the dense bushland where he absconded. The incident has deeply affected the tight-knit community and the broader policing family, raising questions about how authorities address extremist views, as Freeman previously identified as a "sovereign citizen" disavowing Australian laws. Authorities are urging residents to stay indoors until the suspect is apprehended.</p>

Simultaneously, new US tariffs of 25%, bringing total duties to 50%, kicked in on Indian shipments, raising concerns about India's export competitiveness. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw slight gains driven by Nikon, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced declines, with some economists warning of "irrational exuberance" in the latter. Improving liquidity and a dovish Fed could make any market correction shallow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, this article explores the profound and lasting impact on its youngest survivors, now adults. Many children experienced severe trauma, displacement, and mental health issues, with limited access to support, leading to a generation often silent about their experiences. Filmmaker E'jaaz Mason's documentary "Katrina Babies" highlights these untold stories and the disruption of community bonds, especially for the disproportionately affected Black neighborhoods. Despite levee upgrades, New Orleans remains vulnerable due to coastal erosion and climate change, with concerns raised about reduced federal agency funding, shifting responsibility from authorities to a narrative of community resilience.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to discuss a new draft law on military service, primarily focusing on voluntary recruitment for the Bundeswehr, the country's armed forces. This move comes as Germany, a NATO member, aims to upgrade its defensive capabilities following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and needs to recruit approximately 80,000 additional professional soldiers and 140,000 reservists. Ahead of the discussion, an anti-war alliance, "Rheinmetall Entwaffen," staged a blockade at a careers center in Cologne, protesting against potential reintroduction of compulsory service and criticizing government spending priorities. The reintroduction of conscription, suspended in 2011, remains a possibility if voluntary recruitment proves insufficient.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly criticized Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, labeling them "incompetent" for their handling of Chicago's crime rates, particularly after a deadly weekend. Trump suggested they should call him for federal assistance, an offer previously met with strong opposition from the Democratic leaders. Pritzker and Johnson have rejected the idea of deploying the National Guard, calling it an "overreach" and stating the city does not need to be "occupied." While Chicago's crime statistics show some categories are down year-over-year, overall crime has increased significantly since 2021, fueling the political disagreement over the city's safety strategy. The White House has accused Illinois Democrats of "whining" while crime rages.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their annual gas and electricity bills rise by £35 under the latest energy price cap announced by regulator Ofgem, bringing the typical yearly cost to £1,755. This 2% increase, slightly higher than anticipated, takes effect in October, prompting concerns among campaigners about another winter of high energy bills. The rise is attributed to increased wholesale energy costs, transportation expenses, and government-mandated support measures for consumers. While some support, like the £150 Warm Home Discount, will be expanded, all billpayers will contribute through higher standing charges, leading consumer groups to advise shopping for fixed-price deals.</p>

The pilot ejected safely with minor injuries. This article reported that if a 2024 maintenance newsletter on cold weather sensor problems had been referenced during the call, different advice might have prevented the crash.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a remarkable miniature 10th-century figurine, believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking. Carved from walrus tusk, the 1.2-inch piece depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and a neat hairstyle, challenging the common perception of Vikings as savage. Curator Peter Pentz suggests the figure, possibly representing a king like Harald Bluetooth, signifies wealth and status through its detailed grooming. Originally found in Norway in 1796 and forgotten in archives, its unique, smiling expression and individual details contrast sharply with other, simpler Viking-era human depictions, making it a significant archaeological discovery.

While Hamilton is 40, the analysis posits that biological aging, affecting adaptability and brain processing, could be a factor, questioning if he can regain dominance without a car better suited to his ingrained style.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system designed to make its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants more meltdown-proof. This breakthrough, announced by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, is a significant step in developing fourth-generation nuclear plants with a closed-loop fuel cycle. Unlike conventional reactors, fast reactors use high-energy neutrons for greater fuel efficiency and can act as breeders, converting consumed fuel into more fissile material for reuse. Integral fast reactors, which use liquid metal coolants, are characterized by reprocessing spent fuel within the same facility, enhancing safety and sustainability in nuclear energy production. This technology represents a major advancement in nuclear safety.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, with declines narrowing to 1.5% year-on-year, a significant improvement from previous months. This positive shift is attributed to Beijing's intensified campaign against "involution" or excessive competition and price wars, which had previously strained company profitability. While overall profits for major industrial firms still fell by 1.7% in the first seven months, manufacturing and utilities sectors showed improvements, contrasting with a sharp plunge in mining industry profits. The government's policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels and curbing aggressive price-cutting are beginning to show early effects, although analysts suggest sustained recovery may require further industry consolidation.

          <p>Donald Trump's imposition of a 50% tariff on Indian goods, including an additional 25% over its Russian oil purchases, has significantly threatened India's $434 billion merchandise exports to the US.

Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which heavily rely on the US market, are particularly vulnerable. While some electronic goods currently have exemptions, Trump has also threatened high tariffs on pharmaceuticals, leaving a large portion of India's exports exposed and forcing a re-evaluation of its global trade competitiveness.

The Central Bank of Russia forecasts meager growth for 2025, raising the risk of prolonged recession. Inflationary pressures, driven by defense spending and labor shortages, are also a concern, forcing the central bank to adjust interest rates.
