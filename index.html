          <p>China has responded to accusations from the U.S. regarding violations of the Geneva trade agreement by asserting that the U.S. is the party undermining the terms of the deal. A spokesperson for the Chinese commerce department stated that recent U.S. actions, including export restrictions on semiconductor design software and the revocation of visas for Chinese students, are serious breaches of the agreement. China vowed to take measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues to act in ways that damage them, and they have maintained control over rare earth exports. This exchange signals a worsening of relations between the two economic superpowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as the new president of Poland, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. The state electoral commission announced Nawrocki's victory with 50.9% of the votes, marking a significant shift from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to impede Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, and this result is likely to energize the national conservative Law and Justice opposition. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic and family values and advocates for Polish sovereignty within the EU.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the distribution of bonuses from participating in the Club World Cup, wearing shirts reading “Club World Ca$h Grab” during warm-ups. The MLS Players Association expressed solidarity, stating that the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of the large FIFA payments to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team. The players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes to the arrangement, but the league has not presented a reasonable proposal.</p>
