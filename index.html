        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump revoked the Secret Service protection for Kamala Harris, initially extended by Joe Biden. Harris, as a former vice-president, was legally entitled to six months of extended security, but Biden prolonged it by another year through an executive directive. Trump's memo, dated Thursday, instructs the Secret Service to discontinue security procedures for Harris starting September 1, beyond what is legally mandated. A senior advisor to Harris stated her gratitude to the Secret Service for their dedication to safety, reflecting the importance of their role in protecting high-profile individuals. The action comes ahead of Harris's book tour for her memoir about her 2024 presidential campaign, adding a layer of complexity to her public appearances. Optimism remains low regarding the protection of former officials. </p>

          <p>Recent Ukrainian drone and rocket strikes on the Druzhba pipeline in Russia have disrupted Hungary's oil supply, leading to increased tension between the two countries. Hungarian politicians, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban, have strongly condemned the attacks, with Orban even involving Donald Trump, who expressed anger over the strikes. Hungary issued an entry ban against a Ukrainian commander involved in the pipeline attack, further escalating the conflict, and Ukraine's President Zelenskyy views the ban as an attempt to shift blame. Experts suggest that Ukraine's actions are aimed at undermining Russia's war economy by targeting its fossil fuel revenues, despite the impact on Hungary, which relies heavily on Russian oil imports. The situation highlights Hungary's risky dependence on Russian energy and the broader geopolitical implications of the conflict. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is attempting to remove Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook from her position, prompting a legal challenge. Trump asked a judge to deny Cook's request for an injunction that would prevent her firing, while the Federal Reserve took no stance on Cook's lawsuit but requested a prompt ruling. The filings occurred shortly before a scheduled hearing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., concerning Cook's request for a temporary restraining order. The legal battle underscores the tension between the executive branch and the independence of the Federal Reserve. The matter is under judicial review. </p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a Mass attended by young students resulted in the deaths of two children and injuries to eighteen others. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, acted alone and died by suicide at the scene, having legally purchased the weapons used. Police Chief Brian O'Hara stated that the shooter was deranged, obsessed with past shootings, and had a wide range of hate towards various individuals and groups. The families of the victims, 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, have issued statements expressing their grief and requesting privacy. The event is being investigated as a possible act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. </p>

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.8% in the June quarter, surpassing expectations due to strong performance in manufacturing, construction, and services. Despite the positive GDP figures, economists note signs of a potential slowdown, with nominal GDP growth falling to 8.8% compared to 10.8% in the previous quarter. The implementation of U.S. tariffs on Indian imports is expected to further soften growth in the coming quarters, and the Indian rupee has fallen to record lows amid these concerns. However, some economists believe that India's economy is still on track to expand by 7% this year, despite the challenges posed by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The de minimis exemption, which allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has officially ended, impacting retailers globally. This change, enacted by President Trump, is expected to cause significant disruption to supply chains and potentially increase prices for consumers. The exemption had been widely used by e-commerce companies, particularly Chinese retailers like Shein and Temu, and its removal is anticipated to cost U.S. consumers billions. The end of de minimis could benefit larger retailers like Amazon and Walmart, while smaller businesses and online marketplaces face challenges in adapting to the new regulations. </p>

Concerns over the potential tax led to significant drops in the share values of NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays on the London Stock Exchange.

Venezuela responded by deploying warships and drones to patrol its coastline and recruiting militia members.

Musk's lawyers argue that the lawsuit is a waste of time and resources, as there was no investor harm or ongoing violation. They also accuse the SEC of targeting Musk in a relentless pursuit. </p>

However, adjusted earnings in its core e-commerce business fell due to heavy investments in quick commerce initiatives.
