          <p>House Democrats have publicly released a controversial letter and drawing, purportedly from Donald Trump, that was part of a "birthday book" for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. The document, obtained from Epstein's estate via a subpoena by the House Oversight Committee, contains a suggestive message. The White House has vehemently denied the letter's authenticity, claiming the signature is not Trump's and that he did not create the drawing, while continuing to pursue a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for its initial reporting on the matter.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release a significant downward revision of U.S. jobs data, potentially showing that hiring was weaker than initially reported by hundreds of thousands of jobs through March 2025. This annual benchmark revision, which provides a more accurate count of employment, could indicate that the labor market's slowdown began earlier than recent monthly reports suggest. The adjustment comes as the Trump administration questions the validity of BLS data and could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rate cuts amid a stalling job market.

          <p>The federal trial of Ryan Routh, who is accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump in September 2024, began with jury selection in Fort Pierce, Florida. Routh, who is representing himself, posed a series of bizarre questions to potential jurors concerning topics like the war in Gaza and turtles on the road, which the judge dismissed as irrelevant and politically charged. The trial is expected to last up to four weeks, with Routh facing charges that carry a potential life sentence if he is convicted of the assassination attempt at Trump's golf club.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate approaching a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better loan terms. Experts recommend focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher scores qualify for significantly lower interest rates over the life of a loan. Additionally, increasing the down payment to 20% or more can reduce the lender's risk and lead to a better rate, while also avoiding private mortgage insurance. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge, jumping more than 15% after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index. This long-anticipated move, effective September 22, is a major milestone for the company, which went public in 2021. Inclusion in the benchmark index typically leads to increased demand for a company's stock from passive index funds, which are required to hold shares of all S&P 500 constituents.

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy appeared on the Royal Courts of Justice in London, depicting a judge using a gavel to beat a protester. Banksy authenticated the politically charged artwork via his Instagram account, which activists have interpreted as a commentary on the U.K. government's recent ban of the protest group Palestine Action. Despite the attention, authorities quickly covered the piece and announced its removal, citing the building's protected historical status which requires its original character to be maintained.</p>

          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances where enrollment can be delayed or assistance can be obtained. Individuals who are still working past age 65 and have creditable health insurance through an employer with 20 or more employees can typically delay Part B enrollment without penalty. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the premium costs. However, skipping Part B enrollment can restrict access to supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

          <p>For individuals with a significant amount of cash, such as $40,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account requires careful consideration of current economic conditions. A key factor is the long-term interest potential, as a CD locks in a fixed rate, protecting against future declines, whereas savings account rates are variable. Savers must also assess their ability to leave the funds untouched, as CDs penalize early withdrawals, making high-yield savings a better option for those needing liquidity. Both options, however, offer substantially higher returns than traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

Recognizing the limited preparation time for the tournament, Tuchel and his staff see specialized set-piece strategies like the long throw as an efficient way to gain a competitive edge, a view supported by throw-in coaches who argue the technique is an underestimated part of the game.</p>

The guide also lists numerous legal aid organizations and community resources available to provide assistance, legal representation, and "know your rights" workshops for those affected by the renewed enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, traders in financial markets are now pricing in a small but notable possibility of the Federal Reserve implementing a half-percentage-point interest rate cut. While a quarter-point reduction at the upcoming meeting is still considered the most likely scenario, with an 88% probability, the chance of a more aggressive 50-basis-point cut has risen to 12%. This market sentiment reflects growing concerns about the labor market's health and increasing pressure on the central bank to take decisive action to stimulate the economy.

          <p>A legal analysis explores the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision to lift an injunction on immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles, effectively allowing federal agents to resume stops based on a combination of factors including apparent ethnicity and occupation. The ruling, issued on the emergency "shadow docket," was criticized in a dissent by Justice Sotomayor for essentially legalizing racial profiling of Latinos. The article examines the legal precedents, such as *City of Los Angeles v. Lyons*, that make it difficult for courts to issue broad injunctions against law enforcement, even when faced with evidence of unconstitutional practices.</p>

          <p>France is facing a new political crisis after Prime Minister François Bayrou and his government were defeated in a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's push for an unpopular budget aimed at tackling France's massive national debt, which included proposals to scrap holidays and freeze pensions. Lacking a majority, his government was brought down by a coalition of left-wing and hard-right parties. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint the country's fifth prime minister in under two years, with options including dissolving parliament and calling for new elections.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has increased its settlement offer in its bankruptcy case to a minimum of $230 million for over 600 survivors of clergy sexual abuse. This new figure, a $50 million increase from the previous offer, is an attempt to secure the necessary two-thirds approval from claimants after many were advised to reject the initial amount. Survivors may also be able to pursue additional funds from the archdiocese's primary insurer, which has not yet settled but is reportedly in active negotiations. The case has been contentious, involving accusations of cover-ups by church leadership.</p>

          <p>A recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to an all-time low. The August Survey of Consumer Expectations showed a significant drop in the perceived probability of securing new employment after a job loss, reaching its lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This finding aligns with other data showing a dramatic slowdown in hiring, suggesting the "Great Resignation" trend has ended as employees now feel more compelled to stay in their current roles due to a less favorable job market.</p>
