          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 15:08:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Health Secretary RFK Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon advocate for eliminating mental health screenings in schools, arguing they "medicalize" normal childhood behavior and create new stigmas. They propose focusing instead on "natural sources" of well-being like strong families, nutrition, and fitness. However, mental health experts interviewed by NPR strongly disagree, asserting that such screenings actually reduce stigma by normalizing conversations around mental health and provide crucial early detection of struggles. These experts emphasize that screenings are not diagnostic tools but rather awareness-starters, helping schools implement supportive programs and connect vulnerable children to care before issues escalate into crises, much like vision or hearing tests.</p>

          <p>A growing number of affluent consumers, defined as households earning over $169,751 annually, are now frequenting discount stores like Walmart and Aldi, a trend that has accelerated since the pandemic. Data from GlobalData Retail indicates a significant increase in this demographic shopping at budget retailers since 2021, primarily driven by persistent inflation that has eroded savings and increased the cost of living across all income brackets. These higher-income shoppers are seeking better value for money, particularly in grocery and household essentials, to stretch their dollars further. Discount retailers are actively responding by refurbishing stores, improving presentation, and expanding brand selections to appeal to a wider customer base, offering competitive prices in more aesthetically pleasing shopping environments.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Eritrean man, who arrived in the UK by small boat, successfully obtained a High Court injunction to temporarily block his removal to France. This case marks the first legal challenge against the UK-France "one in, one out" returns pilot scheme, where the UK agreed to send migrants back to France in exchange for accepting a refugee. The man's lawyers argued for more time to present evidence that he might have been a victim of modern slavery, a claim the Home Office had not yet assessed. This injunction raises significant questions about the scheme's legal robustness and whether other migrants allocated for return flights will use similar grounds to delay or block their transport out of the UK.</p>

          <p>Eleven candidates vying for California governor in 2026 offered their assessments of Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure and outlined their own policy agendas. Democratic candidates like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's efforts in redistricting and strengthening the state's economy, while also identifying areas for improvement such as high-speed rail and the housing crisis. Republican hopefuls, including Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton, were generally more critical, with Bianco suggesting Newsom acts like a Republican for political gain and Hilton prioritizing solutions for rising housing costs. The article reveals a diverse range of opinions on current state leadership and potential future directions for California, covering issues from healthcare and education to fiscal accountability.</p>

Despite not carrying a weapon, Zinn continued his false claims while being arrested, later admitting he wanted to "draw attention from the real shooter" and "be a martyr." During the subsequent investigation, a search of Zinn's phone allegedly revealed images of child sexual abuse material, leading to the additional, severe charges against him.</p>

Generation Z is particularly affected, with 14% experiencing drops of 50 points or more. While homeowners appear more stable, younger Americans struggle with unsecured debt.

          <p>State terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, were dismissed by a New York City judge during a pre-trial hearing. The judge ruled that prosecutors failed to present evidence of a desire to "terrorize the public" or engage in a broader campaign of violence, concluding that the "heinous, but targeted and discrete killing of one person" did not meet the legal definition of terrorism. Despite this dismissal, Mangione still faces nine other state counts, including second-degree murder and eight weapons-related charges, which carry a potential sentence of 25 years to life.

          <p>Cybersecurity firm Netskope is targeting a $7.3 billion valuation in its upcoming initial public offering, having raised its planned price range for shares. The company aims to sell 47.8 million shares between $17 and $19 each, potentially raising as much as $908 million at the top end. This planned debut on Nasdaq comes amid an influx of significant cybersecurity deals and during a broader resurgence in IPO activity, after soaring inflation and interest rates had previously dampened appetite for tech investments. Netskope, founded in 2012, specializes in cloud access security, helping firms protect against cyber threats, and is looking to capitalize on the market's renewed enthusiasm for technology companies.

          <p>Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B sat down with Gayle King to discuss her upcoming album, "Am I the Drama?" and her long-standing reputation for being outspoken and attracting conflict. The Bronx-born artist, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, pushed back against the notion that she genuinely enjoys drama, stating that her "big personality" and "whatever aura that I give" often make her an "easier target" for public scrutiny. She revealed that her reputation for drama dates back to high school, where she was notably voted "most dramatic" in her yearbook. Cardi B candidly shared that the constant drama in her life, despite her public image, often causes her significant stress and emotional toll.</p>

          <p>Alphabet-owned Waymo has obtained a permit to begin testing its robotaxis at San Francisco International Airport, marking a significant expansion of its commercial service in the Bay Area. The rollout will occur in phases, initially involving human safety drivers onboard before transitioning to fully driverless operations for Bay Area riders. Waymo already operates its service in San Mateo County, where the airport is located, and in nearby San Francisco, having also secured permits for Phoenix Sky Harbor and San Jose Mineta International Airports. This development positions Waymo to offer crucial airport transportation, enhancing convenience and expanding its presence in a competitive market that also sees Tesla testing its own robotaxi service.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a federal safety probe into reports of faulty electronic door handles on 2021 Tesla Model Y SUVs. Nine reports detail instances where owners were unable to enter or exit their vehicles, with particular concern for parents unable to access or remove children from the back seat. Some owners even resorted to breaking a vehicle's window to regain entry. The Office of Defects Investigation noted that while Tesla vehicles have internal manual door releases, these cannot be operated by small children, exacerbating entrapment risks, especially in hot vehicles. The investigation, covering 174,290 vehicles, suggests the handles become inoperable due to insufficient voltage from the vehicle.</p>

          <p>House GOP leaders have unveiled a short-term spending bill to fund the government until November 21, aiming to avert a looming shutdown by the September 30 deadline. The legislation proposes maintaining current funding levels, with additional allocations for lawmaker security following Charlie Kirk's assassination, and a budget fix for the District of Columbia. Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a quick House vote, but the bill faces significant opposition from Democrats who demand an extension of enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance. With a narrow Republican majority in the House and a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, bipartisan support is crucial, making the bill's passage uncertain amid political divisions.</p>

He urged the UK government to be a "critical friend" to the US, advocating for stronger action on Ukraine, addressing the climate emergency, and ending tariff wars that disrupt global trade. Khan emphasized London's inclusive, multicultural identity as a bastion against hate, determined to defend its liberal, democratic values despite increasing political polarization.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a substantial $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and Penguin Random House, alleging a concerted campaign to damage his reputation ahead of the 2024 election. The lawsuit claims that a series of articles about Trump, including reports on his former chief of staff's warnings and the making of "The Apprentice," amounted to libel. Trump's attorneys argue the Times has become a "fullthroated mouthpiece of the Democrat Party," engaging in "industrial-scale defamation and libel against political opponents." A New York Times spokesperson stated the lawsuit lacks any legitimate legal claims and is an attempt to stifle independent reporting, vowing to vigorously defend against these intimidation tactics and uphold journalistic integrity.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes President Donald Trump's inconsistent and ineffective Ukraine strategy, arguing his "talking tough" has not translated into decisive action against Russia. Despite initial Moscow unease over his intentions, Trump has failed to implement "bone-crushing" sanctions or secure a ceasefire, instead pressuring European allies. The article highlights Russia's continued aggression, including drone incursions into Polish territory, as evidence of Trump's strategy undermining European security. It suggests Trump's demands for increased EU imports of US liquefied natural gas and tariffs on China and India are diversionary tactics, designed to bully allies rather than genuinely confront Putin.</p>

It emphasizes the importance of depositing only funds one can comfortably part with due to early withdrawal penalties. While online banks often offer the most competitive CD rates, savers also have the option to consider variable-rate alternatives like high-yield savings accounts, balancing flexibility against guaranteed returns in a changing rate environment.

The project's estimated cost ballooned from an initial $50 million to over $95 million due to inflation and a dramatic drop in airport revenue during the pandemic when passenger numbers plummeted. With the help of federal support and a recovery in passenger traffic, construction has finally commenced. The larger Concourse E aims to attract more international flights, as the airport currently offers only seasonal direct flights to Cancún and a few Caribbean cities, necessitating connecting flights for most other international destinations.</p>

          <p>Pregnant women are facing confusion and reduced access to COVID boosters due to recent Trump administration policy changes and conflicting guidance, raising significant concerns for maternal and newborn health. The FDA narrowed eligibility, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. inaccurately stated the CDC would no longer recommend vaccines for healthy pregnant women, causing chaos for pharmacies and patients. Experts from ACOG and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly reaffirm the importance of vaccination for both mother and child, as newborns are particularly vulnerable. States are now taking independent action to expand access, but vaccine hesitancy, fueled by political rhetoric, remains a challenge.</p>
