          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a veteran aide, as the first-ever vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a move widely interpreted as designating a successor. While the appointment doesn't guarantee al-Sheikh the presidency, it positions him as the frontrunner to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas. This decision comes amidst pressure from Western and Arab allies for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to reform and take on a greater role in governing the Gaza Strip after the war. The move is unlikely to improve Fatah's image among Palestinians, who view the party as corrupt and out of touch.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, often called the "Godfather of AI," expresses growing concern about the rapid development of artificial intelligence, estimating a 10% to 20% risk that AI could eventually take control from humans. While he acknowledges AI's potential to transform education, medicine, and address climate change, Hinton criticizes major companies for prioritizing profits over safety. He advocates for AI companies to dedicate a significantly larger portion of their computing power to safety research, suggesting a third of their resources, rather than the current smaller allocation. Hinton is particularly disappointed with Google, where he previously worked, for reversing its stance on military AI applications.</p>

          <p>Support for Canada's two major parties, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, is converging as Election Day approaches, according to recent polls. While Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party maintains a lead, it has narrowed significantly from the start of the campaign. Pollsters suggest that the Liberal Party is still likely to win, potentially securing Carney a full term as prime minister due to the distribution of votes across the country. Even if the national vote were tied, the Liberals would likely win more seats in the House of Commons.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders' slide in the NFL Draft ignited a heated debate about the role of race in sports, with some drawing comparisons to Colin Kaepernick's situation. Stephen A.

Other voices, including former Congressman Jamaal Bowman, suggested Sanders' perceived image contributed to his draft position. The Sanders family has not commented on the racial aspects of the situation, instead focusing on faith and gratitude after Shedeur Sanders was drafted.</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" and "sex" as biological. The guidance states that transgender women (biological men) should generally not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals and restaurants, while ensuring trans people are not left without any facilities. The EHRC emphasizes that identifying as trans does not change a person's sex under the Equality Act, and exclusions should be considered on a case-by-case basis, ensuring no trans person is left without access to facilities.</p>

The incident occurred as Iranian and U.S. officials met in Oman for nuclear program talks.

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett suggests that plans to shift U.S. iPhone assembly to India may be unrealistic, as the iPhone components would still be made in China. Moffett contends that it's not so easy to diversify to India, and Apple's supply chain would likely face resistance. He notes that a global trade war impacts both costs and sales, and moving assembly to India might only help with the former. Moffett also points out that Apple isn't getting help from its carriers to cushion the blow of tariffs, and backlash against Apple in China over U.S. tariffs will hurt iPhone sales.</p>

          <p>A third round of talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran’s nuclear activities concluded Saturday after several hours of indirect negotiations, partly in writing, between senior officials and teams of technical experts from both sides. Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, said in an interview with Iran’s state television that the talks were “very serious” and focused on details of a potential agreement. Mr. Araghchi said the negotiations would resume next Saturday with Oman continuing to mediate the talks, which include Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special envoy, and the teams of experts.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump met at the Vatican ahead of Pope Francis's funeral - their first face-to-face encounter since February's acrimonious Oval Office showdown. The White House described the 15-minute meeting in St Peter's Basilica as "very productive" and Zelensky later called it "very symbolic" with the "potential to become historic". After leaving Rome later in the day, Trump took aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioning his willingness to end the war after Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.</p>
