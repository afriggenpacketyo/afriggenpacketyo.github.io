        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is facing significant political instability following the resignation of its fifth prime minister in under two years, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to issue a 48-hour deadline to find a path forward. This chaos places a spotlight on the nation's precarious financial situation, with a budget deficit at 5.8% of GDP and a debt pile of 113%, both far exceeding EU rules. The political deadlock makes necessary fiscal consolidation seem unlikely, worrying both EU officials and international investors who anticipate potential credit rating downgrades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, has revealed that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat. A recent legal precedent required this specific classification for a conviction under the Official Secrets Act. Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements meeting this new, higher threshold, leading to the charges being dropped and sparking criticism over the government's official stance on China.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice related to his 2020 congressional testimony. The charges concern his statements about the handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. The indictment was filed shortly before the five-year statute of limitations expired, fueling accusations from critics that the move is a politically motivated action by President Trump, who had previously fired Comey. Mr. Comey maintains his innocence and is scheduled to appear in court.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to reduce tariff-free quotas for imported steel and hike tariffs on excess imports from 25% to 50%, citing unsustainable levels of global overcapacity. This news prompted a rally in the shares of major European steel producers, including SSAB and Thyssenkrupp. Conversely, auto industry stocks fell on concerns that the tariffs will drive up manufacturing costs, while the UK's beleaguered steel sector warned the move could be an existential blow.

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has sparked controversy with comments suggesting that Poland and the Baltic states opposed her 2021 initiative for direct EU talks with Vladimir Putin, which she implied could have de-escalated tensions before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Her remarks drew sharp rebukes from officials in those nations, who labeled the claims "outrageous" and an attempt to deflect from her own administration's Russia policies. The Kremlin, however, praised Merkel's statement, claiming it accurately depicted the EU's internal divisions.</p>

          <p>Josh Cavallo, who became the world's only openly gay top-flight male professional footballer in 2021, speaks out about the daily death threats and homophobic abuse he has received since coming out. Now playing for a non-league English team, he describes the ongoing "toxic masculinity" within football and uses his platform to advocate for equality and inclusion. Cavallo is critical of FIFA's decision to host World Cups in countries like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where homosexuality is illegal, highlighting the global challenges LGBTQ+ individuals face in the sport.</p>

          <p>A misconduct hearing has exposed a WhatsApp group in which six Cambridgeshire police officers shared thousands of racist, misogynistic, and discriminatory messages, including jokes about murder victims. One inspector has been dismissed, and five other officers resigned prior to the hearing; the panel concluded they too would have been dismissed. The chat, described as a "grotesque carnival of discrimination and abuse," has severely damaged public trust and revealed a toxic culture within the unit.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is confronting two no-confidence votes within three months, a move initiated by both far-right and far-left factions in an increasingly polarized European Parliament. She faces accusations of policy failures on migration and climate, as well as criticism for a centralized leadership style that has alienated some members. While she is expected to survive the votes, the challenges underscore the fragility of the centrist coalition and the growing power of extremist parties to disrupt the EU's legislative agenda.</p>

          <p>A peaceful protest in Myanmar's war-torn Sagaing region turned deadly when a motorized paraglider dropped two bombs on the gathering, killing at least 24 people and injuring 47. The crowd had assembled for a candlelight vigil during a national holiday to protest against the military junta. This attack highlights a disturbing trend of the military using paramotors and advanced drones for airstrikes as it continues its brutal civil war against armed resistance groups, with human rights organizations calling for urgent international intervention to protect civilians.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing cascading flight delays and cancellations nationwide as a result of staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. Considered essential, controllers are required to work without pay, leading to an increase in sick calls that have left towers in major hubs like Nashville, Dallas, and Chicago understaffed. The controllers' union says the shutdown is exacerbating a pre-existing, critical staffing shortage, adding immense financial stress to an already high-pressure job and highlighting the aviation system's fragility.</p>

          <p>The government of Chad has unilaterally ended its 15-year conservation management agreement with African Parks, an organization where the Duke of Sussex serves on the board of directors. Chad's environment ministry cited the charity's alleged failure to curb a resurgence in poaching and accused it of having an arrogant and disrespectful attitude. The decision is a significant blow to the conservation group, which has recently faced other controversies, including allegations of abuse by its staff in the Republic of Congo.</p>

          <p>A building undergoing renovation in Madrid partially collapsed, resulting in the deaths of four construction workers and injuring at least three others. The fatal incident occurred when several ceiling structures inside the building, which was being converted into a four-star hotel, gave way.

          <p>Researchers have made a significant breakthrough that could revolutionize organ transplantation by successfully converting a human kidney to the universal O blood type. Using enzymes to remove blood-type markers, the team transplanted the modified organ into a brain-dead recipient, where it functioned for two days without rejection. This pioneering technique, detailed in *Nature Biomedical Engineering*, holds the potential to drastically reduce organ transplant waiting lists and address inequities in organ allocation by creating a universal supply.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have begun arriving at a U.S. Army Reserve base near Chicago for a contentious federal deployment to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities and personnel. The deployment, ordered by the Trump administration, has been fiercely opposed by Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have filed a lawsuit to block what they describe as a political and aggressive federal overreach. The arrival of troops from another state for such a mission is considered a highly unusual move.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm off the western coast of Mexico, with its outer bands already impacting the Baja California Sur peninsula.

Moisture from the storm is also expected to pose a flash flood risk to parts of the U.S. Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts defended his decision to initially bypass dominant reliever Roki Sasaki in a key save situation during a playoff game, a choice that nearly proved costly. Roberts explained that he is carefully managing the workload of the rookie pitcher, who only recently transitioned to a high-leverage bullpen role after a shoulder injury. Although Sasaki was ultimately brought in to secure the final out, the situation underscores the team's challenge of balancing immediate needs with protecting a young, vital arm for a long postseason.</p>
