          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $950 million for Saturday night's drawing, after no ticket matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's roughly $850 million prize. This marks the game's sixth-largest jackpot ever, boasting an estimated cash value of $428.9 million before taxes. Powerball ticket sales have doubled as more players participate, with a single winner having the choice of a lump sum payment or an annuity. The substantial prize pool continues to grow, attracting widespread public interest despite the challenging odds of 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

The article highlights Australian rare earths producer Lynas's plan to raise A$750 million and Qantas's record high shares after strong earnings.

          <p>South Korea's central bank held its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing a need to further assess housing prices in the capital and household debt. The Bank of Korea upgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% and GDP growth forecast to 0.9%, expecting a modest recovery in domestic demand. The article notes that exports are likely to slow due to expanding U.S. tariffs, despite recent agreements from President Trump's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.

          <p>Family, friends, and officials commemorated the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death by reenacting his 1955 train ride from Chicago to Mississippi. Organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, the journey included Till's cousin and last surviving eyewitness, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr. The event serves as a poignant reminder of Till's brutal lynching after reportedly whistling at a white woman, an act that, through his mother's insistence on an open-casket funeral, helped spark the modern Civil Rights Movement. Participants aim to remember the past and acknowledge progress, emphasizing that Till "didn't die in vain."</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating between China and the Philippines near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal as a resupply deadline approaches. A Philippine Navy spokesman reported a 1,500-tonne Chinese tugboat sighted just 5 nautical miles south of the BRP Sierra Madre, a grounded Philippine vessel. Two Philippine coastguard ships and a civilian patrol vessel were intercepted by a Chinese coastguard ship while heading towards the shoal, forcing them to turn around. Experts note a return to heightened tensions after a period of peaceful coexistence, indicating a potential flashpoint in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that world leaders "are laughing behind his back" at President Donald Trump, despite Trump's claims of their respect. Newsom, who has met numerous foreign officials, described Trump as "being played everywhere" and an "embarrassment." His comments echo past instances, including footage from a Buckingham Palace reception and the 2018 United Nations General Assembly, where leaders were seen openly laughing at Trump. This article highlights the perceived discrepancy between Trump's self-portrayal and the private opinions of international figures.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, two employees at an Ontario surgery center, for allegedly assaulting and interfering with U.S. immigration officers. The incident occurred when landscapers, one an allegedly unauthorized immigrant, ran into the facility to evade an ICE raid. The staffers reportedly wedged themselves between officers and the individual, and grabbed an officer's arm. This case continues U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli's aggressive approach to prosecuting individuals who interfere with ICE operations.</p>

          <h2>Pre-Owned Tesla Cybertruck Values Plummet Amid Sales Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 20:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pre-owned Tesla Cybertruck values are plummeting, with the average price dropping nearly 30% in the past year to just over $84,000, a trend experts call "unprecedented." This reflects a broader hit to all used Tesla vehicles, whose average price is under $28,000. The decline is attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk and a massive decrease in new car sales for 2025. Despite initial hype and a teased price of $40,000, the Cybertruck launched at double that, leading some drivers and experts to question its long-term market viability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, signaling strong demand for AI infrastructure, but its stock slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of estimates for the second consecutive period. The company expects revenue of $54 billion this quarter, with its finance chief projecting $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Despite a 56% overall revenue increase, this marks Nvidia's slowest growth period since the generative AI boom began. The article also notes the impact of U.S. licenses for H20 chip shipments to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei was pelted with stones and bottles during a campaign caravan in Buenos Aires province, though he was unhurt. The incident cut short his rally and heightened tensions just days before provincial elections and ahead of midterm elections in October. Protesters shouted "Out with Milei!" as his motorcade was attacked, leading to scuffles between supporters and opponents. The event, which injured a Milei supporter, comes amidst a scandal involving alleged misuse of funds by a former disability agency head, further testing the president's popularity.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has finally appointed Steve Kang, president of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison, fulfilling a campaign promise after more than two and a half years. This appointment aims to help filmmakers navigate city bureaucracy, a crucial step as L.A. faces a slump in film and TV production and loses jobs to other regions with better incentives. The delay had frustrated industry advocates, who view the role as vital for supporting the city's signature industry and improving local filming processes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and intensified ICE operations are creating a tense atmosphere in Washington D.C., with residents feeling an unprecedented extension of presidential authority. The article details an immigration raid in Mount Pleasant where federal agents detained Latino men, sparking outrage from locals who criticized the actions as "Gestapo" tactics. Critics argue these measures, which include Trump taking control of local law enforcement, are not making the city safer but are instead divisive and contribute to a feeling of being "more policed" in predominantly Democratic neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, was ousted less than a month into her role, triggering the resignations of several top agency leaders. Her lawyers claim she was "targeted" for defending science against "unscientific, reckless directives" from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic. Departing officials, including Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, cited the "weaponization of public health" and concerns that political agendas were undermining scientific integrity, warning of potential harm to vulnerable populations. This chaos follows a tumultuous period for the CDC, including a shooting incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intense dust storms, known as haboobs, are becoming a growing concern across Southern California and the Central Valley, with experts linking their increase to climate change. Factors like drying conditions, water overuse, wildfires, and construction contribute to these events, which have previously sent dust walls as high as 3,000 feet to Los Angeles. The consequences are serious, including health risks from disease- and chemical-laden particles, decreased air quality, and impacts on solar panels and snowmelt. Researchers are working to improve forecasting and understand the varied health impacts of these storms.</p>
