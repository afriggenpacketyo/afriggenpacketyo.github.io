          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei addressed the impact of U.S. sanctions on the company's technology, particularly in chip development, during an interview with People's Daily. While acknowledging that Huawei's Ascend chips lag behind U.S. counterparts by a generation, Ren suggested that techniques like stacking and clustering could achieve comparable computing results. He emphasized China's advantages in AI development, citing a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network, along with open-source software. Ren's comments come as Washington increases restrictions on China, with Huawei at the center of the storm, including new guidance interpreting the use of Ascend chips as a potential violation of export controls.</p>

          <p>Kyiv experienced a massive Russian drone assault for the second consecutive day, with explosions and gunfire heard across the city as Ukrainian air defenses engaged incoming drones. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko urged residents to seek shelter, while the head of Kyiv's military administration reported that drones were attacking multiple districts simultaneously. Emergency services responded to at least four districts, where residential buildings and cars were damaged, and debris fell near a school, although no casualties were immediately reported. The strikes follow Russia's largest drone barrage of the war, which Moscow claims was retaliation for recent Ukrainian attacks inside Russia.</p>

          <p>The Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amid protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel without engaging crowds unless necessary. These troops will carry weapons but without ammunition loaded, using it only for self-defense, and they will not employ rubber bullets or pepper spray unless President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act. The Los Angeles Police Department emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies to ensure a coordinated and lawful response, while retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds stressed the importance of clarifying the rules of engagement for the troops' sake. The deployed force, known as "Task Force 51," consists of 4,800 troops trained in de-escalation and crowd control.</p>

He notes that few immigrants are moving in, raising concerns about the future of the community. Ford, a staunch Trump supporter, reflects the sentiment of 81% of the county's voters who favored Trump in the 2024 election, driven by a sense that modern Democrats have neglected their losses since the decline of coal mining. Despite Trump's unfulfilled promises of revitalizing the region, many residents remain loyal, seeking a return to prosperity.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, in an effort to lower the high prices of the country's staple food. This move will leave Japan with a 100,000-ton rice reserve, with the released rice going to smaller supermarket operators as well as major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, prompting the government to resort to direct contracts with retailers to sell cheaper rice. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to sell at 1,700 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves calling it a "landmark decision" to "kickstart" economic growth. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment is necessary to usher in a "golden age of clean energy," as the plant is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C criticized the government for not being transparent about the project's cost, fearing it will add to consumer bills. The government insists nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, though Sizewell C will take at least a decade to complete.</p>

The new Streaming & Studios business will be headed by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks company, including CNN and Discovery, will be led by Gunnar Wiedenfels. The split follows the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros Discovery, aiming to empower each company with sharper focus and strategic flexibility.</p>

          <p>Japan has confirmed the first simultaneous operations of two Chinese aircraft carriers in the Pacific, with the Shandong spotted near Japan's southernmost Okinotori island and the Liaoning observed near Japan's easternmost Minamitori Island. The Shandong conducted landing and takeoff drills involving its fighter jets and helicopters north of the Okinotori, while the Liaoning conducted similar drills southwest of Minamitori. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stated that Japan will closely monitor China's growing maritime activity and step up surveillance, conveying its position to China regarding the developments. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian defended the aircraft carrier's activities, stating they are consistent with international law and practices.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated in Los Angeles following immigration sweeps, leading to violent protests against the Trump administration and ICE. President Trump's decision to deploy Marines and National Guard troops has intensified the situation in the liberal-leaning city, providing the White House with a public foil to showcase progress on immigration enforcement. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the troop deployment, while the administration aims to increase arrest and deportation numbers. The protests have drawn attention to the impact of the raids on families and communities, with local advocates asserting that nonviolent immigrants have been detained.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of another 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to blast the decision and sue the administration for federalizing the initial deployment.

Newsom criticized the conditions under which the first troops were deployed, while the ACLU condemned Trump's mobilization of the Marines. Trump has expressed support for arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement, leading to a lawsuit by Newsom and the state Attorney General challenging the legality of the federalization of California's National Guard.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world," citing "fundamental flaws" and the entrenchment of "outdated gender stereotypes." The Women and Equalities Committee report calls for "bold" action and significant investment to improve paternity leave rules. The current system allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower, which is considered inadequate. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks, highlighting that other countries offer more generous parental leave policies.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use artificial intelligence to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, aiming to automate routine tasks and allow more focus on face-to-face time with students. The Department for Education advises transparency in AI use and emphasizes the need for teachers to check the results. The guidance suggests AI should be used for "low-stakes" marking, such as quizzes and homework, and provides examples of how AI can generate routine letters to parents. While the Association of School and College Leaders acknowledges the potential for freeing up time, concerns remain about data breaches and marking errors.</p>

About 3.5 million tonnes of sludge, containing cancer-linked chemicals and microplastics, are spread annually as cheap fertilizer, with limited regulation. Concerns are growing that farmers may refuse to accept the sludge, leading to incineration or landfill disposal, and the water industry is lobbying regulators and making contingency plans.
