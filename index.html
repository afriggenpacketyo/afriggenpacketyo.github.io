          <p>Volvo Cars announced plans to cut costs by 18 billion Swedish krona after its operating profit fell sharply in the first quarter of the year. The company withdrew its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, citing tariff pressures and broader industry challenges. CEO HÃ¥kan Samuelsson noted increased price competition and new electric vehicle market entrants as contributing factors to the difficult market conditions. The company's shares experienced a significant drop following the announcement as Volvo aims to focus on controllable aspects through its cost action plan. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Young voters in Australia, feeling overlooked by major parties, are poised to voice their climate concerns in the upcoming election. Gen Z and Millennials, who now outnumber baby boomers, are expected to significantly impact the vote due to their growing awareness of climate issues. These young voters are demanding stronger climate policies, including a rapid transition to renewable energy and a phaseout of fossil fuels. Despite the influence of the fossil fuel sector on Australian politics, the youth's focus on climate action could lead to losses for parties with weak environmental policies.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Party in Canada secured a federal election victory, seemingly fueled by President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for Canada to protect its sovereignty and build broader global partnerships in light of the changing relationship with the U.S. The election saw a record number of Canadians casting their votes, with many citing concerns over tariffs and Canadian sovereignty as key issues. Opponents criticized the Conservative leader for perceived similarities to Trump, potentially costing him votes on election day.</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox after footage emerged of a band member making controversial statements. The group rejected any suggestion that they would incite violence against any MP or individual, emphasizing that the footage was taken out of context. The statement follows criticism and assessment by counter-terrorism police, with calls for prosecution and defunding. Kneecap also addressed another video where a band member appeared to shout support for Hamas and Hezbollah, stating they do not support these organizations and condemn all attacks on civilians.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is advocating for a policy change to allow male health workers to conduct mammograms due to critical staff shortages. Currently, only female radiographers are permitted to perform breast screening examinations. The vacancy rate among mammographers is high, with over 17% vacancies in breast exam specialists. While some believe this change could relieve staff shortages and open the job to more qualified people, others, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, argue that women may prefer female radiographers for these intimate screenings.</p>

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy substitutes, after a consultation on the proposal. This move would end the exemption for milk-based drinks, which was initially included due to concerns about calcium consumption. The government aims to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they are subject to the levy. The Treasury says that young people only get a small percentage of their calcium intake from such drinks, making the health benefits less justifiable compared to the harms of excess sugar.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen the Oval Office transformed into a gilded cage, reflecting his delusions of monarchy and authoritarian tendencies. His policies have injected chaos into the economy, undermined campaign promises, and strained international relations. Critics point to his use of executive power, targeting of perceived enemies, and a cabinet of sycophants as signs of his administration's dysfunction. Despite a well-planned agenda, the execution has been undermined by the president's mercurial nature and cabinet infighting, leading to widespread disapproval.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have been characterized by strained alliances, disrupted global trade, and an unpredictable foreign policy. The administration's actions, including tariff implementations and aid cutoffs, have alienated key allies and emboldened rivals. Critics argue that these policies have undermined trust in America and its institutions, leading to a crisis in foreign policy and national security. Canada responded by electing the liberal candidate Mark Carney, completing a 30% swing in polling that has largely been explained by opposition to Trumpâs tariff war and territorial menaces.</p>

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley anticipate that the U.S. and China will engage in trade negotiations and gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports. Despite conflicting statements from both countries, it is expected that tariffs will be reduced to 60% by the end of the second quarter. Comprehensive talks in the second half of the year could lead to further reductions, bringing tariffs down to 34% by yearâs end. Washington has imposed tariffs totalling 145% on Chinese imports this year, while Beijingâs new levies on US goods have risen to 125%. Given the damage already done to the economic cycle, the overall direction of growth is expected to remain downward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals won Canada's federal election due to a backlash against Trump, making leadership and economic survival key issues. Carney, a political newcomer, capitalized on Trump's threats, running against him as much as his Conservative rival. The Conservatives made gains but fell short, while the NDP collapsed. The election highlighted divisions, with Liberals shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and cost-of-living issues resonating with young people, but Trump's actions and policies were the defining issue.</p>
