        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wynn Resorts has withdrawn its application for a casino license in New York City, citing insurmountable opposition and deciding to allocate its capital elsewhere, such as stock buybacks and existing developments like the casino resort in the United Arab Emirates. This follows Las Vegas Sands' similar decision to drop its bid for a Long Island site, attributing it to potential competition from online gaming. Casino executives have voiced concerns about the politicized and costly nature of the licensing process in New York, which has faced numerous delays. MGM Resorts and Resorts World are considered front-runners for two of the three available licenses.</p>

Regeneron has committed to adhering to 23andMe's privacy policies and will use the firm's data for drug development. The acquisition comes after a challenging period for 23andMe, marked by weak demand, a failed subscription service, and a significant data breach in 2023 that exposed the genetic data of millions of users.  Dr. Jennifer King notes that the profit-driven mission will be clearer under Regeneron's control, as the company's original non-profit framing obscured its for-profit intentions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will pay nearly $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the January 6th riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed disappointment with the settlement, warning of its chilling effect on law enforcement.

          <p>Mortgage rates have risen above 7% following Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, causing bond yields to increase and impacting the housing market. The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan reached 7.04%, the highest level since April, leading to a pullback in housing market activity during the spring season. Pending sales of existing homes have decreased, and homebuilder sentiment has declined to its lowest level since the end of 2023.

          <p>Romania has elected Nicusor Dan as its new president, a move seen as a vote for change against the old political guard. Dan defeated hard-right nationalist George Simion in a runoff election, with voters expressing concerns about Simion's extremist views and potential ties to Russia. Simion made costly mistakes during his campaign, including aggressive rhetoric and controversial remarks about foreign leaders. Dan's victory is viewed as a choice for a future firmly within Europe, with many voters expressing relief and excitement over the outcome.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a vote on a tax bill that includes President Trump's agenda, but internal divisions persist over issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements.

The bill also includes a debt limit increase, adding urgency to its passage. The White House is pressuring Republicans to unite behind the bill, but its fate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to remove protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, pending appeal of the case.

          <p>A provision in the House Republicans' tax bill to eliminate federal income taxes on tips has garnered bipartisan support but faces scrutiny from economists and restaurant groups. The proposal, a campaign pledge from President Trump, could benefit tipped workers, but concerns have been raised about its potential impact on wage pressure and low-income workers. Some argue that the tax break is more of a middle-income benefit and may not significantly help lower-income Americans who already owe little or no federal income taxes.</p>
