          <p>Sly Stone, the innovative frontman of Sly & the Family Stone, has died at 82 after battling lung disease, leaving behind a legacy of musical innovation that blended psychedelic rock, soul, jazz, gospel, and Latin influences. Born Sylvester Stewart, Stone began his musical journey in gospel with his siblings before becoming a successful R&B DJ and record producer. He formed Sly & the Family Stone in 1966, a group notable for its inclusion of women and both Black and white musicians, producing hits like "Everyday People" and "Dance to the Music." The band's performance at Woodstock in 1969 is remembered as a legendary moment, though the group later dissolved due to Stone's struggles with drug abuse, but his musical contributions continue to inspire. </p>

          <p>A twin-engine Cessna 414 crashed off the coast of San Diego, resulting in the deaths of all six people on board. The plane went down shortly after takeoff and was en route back to Phoenix after a flight from Arizona.

Audio recordings indicate the pilot struggled to maintain heading and altitude, twice turning toward shore before heading back out to sea and signaling a "Mayday" distress call before radar contact was lost. </p>

          <p>Despite a slight decline in the first quarter of 2025, credit card debt remains a significant financial burden for many Americans, with balances totaling $1.18 trillion and high interest rates exacerbating the issue. Experts recommend proactive measures to reduce debt, emphasizing that waiting for Federal Reserve rate cuts is not a viable solution due to their uncertain timing and minimal impact. It is important to understand the implications of various debt relief options, such as debt forgiveness and management programs, and to avoid assuming automatic eligibility, as each option has specific qualifying criteria. By taking a strategic approach, borrowers can begin to reduce their balances and improve their financial health. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres cautioned against the perils facing the world's oceans, including predatory mining, plastic pollution, and rising sea temperatures, at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. He emphasized the need to ratify the High Seas Treaty, which would allow countries to establish protected marine areas in international waters. Guterres specifically addressed the threat of deep-sea mining, warning against turning the ocean floor into a "wild west." While some countries advocate for exploiting mineral wealth on the ocean floor, others are calling for a moratorium to protect marine biodiversity and carbon sinks. </p>

          <p>Senators Warren and Wyden are scrutinizing Maximus, Inc., a company that administers government benefits, to understand how it might profit from Republican-led Medicaid cuts. They point to Maximus's history of reducing Medicaid enrollment to increase profits and express concern that the company's objectives align with cost-cutting measures. The senators also highlight the company's lobbying efforts and the potential for increased profits during Medicaid "determination" processes. They are demanding transparency regarding Maximus's role in administering new bureaucratic requirements that could lead to millions losing health insurance. </p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced its plan to split into two separate companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. One company will focus on streaming and studios, while the other, Global Networks, will encompass legacy cable networks, TNT Sports, digital products, and European free-to-air channels. The decision raises concerns about where TNT's live sports rights will reside without the streaming portfolio, as U.S. sports haven't been a major driver for HBO Max sign-ups. The management team of Global Networks will determine how to monetize TNT's streaming and digital sports rights, potentially licensing them to other media companies or merging TNT Sports with another entity. </p>
