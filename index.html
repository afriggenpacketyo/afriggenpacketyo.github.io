          <p>The US and European Union have finalized a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU exports and a €514 billion EU investment commitment to the US. While the agreement averts a larger trade war and was hailed by EU leadership as providing "stability," it has drawn sharp criticism from several member states. Leaders in France, Germany, and Hungary condemned the deal as a submission to US pressure, arguing it disproportionately benefits the US and damages European economic interests. The deal now awaits approval from EU member states and the European Parliament. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is planning to charge fees to fintech data aggregators like Plaid, alleging that their frequent and often unnecessary data requests are overwhelming the bank's systems. According to an internal memo, only 13% of 1.89 billion data requests in June were customer-initiated, with the rest being for purposes like product improvement or data harvesting. The bank also cites higher fraud rates associated with these middlemen. Plaid has disputed the claims, stating the data pulls are standard industry practice for services like fraud alerts and reflect growing consumer demand for modern financial tools.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has presented a European-led peace plan for Gaza to US President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. The proposal, developed with France and Germany, follows the breakdown of US-led talks and aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. The initiative comes amid increasing domestic and international pressure on the UK to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. Trump's immediate focus, however, appeared to be on delivering aid to the region, stating the priority is to "get the children fed" before discussing future peace arrangements.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a popular nightclub in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands, has left three men dead and ten others injured. Authorities have described the incident as the British territory's first mass shooting in recent history and are investigating it as a "gangland-type slaying." Police are searching for at least four suspects, and a $10,000 reward has been offered for information leading to their capture. The Premier has called on the local Haitian community to cooperate with the investigation, linking the violence to gang activity concentrated within that community.</p>

At his sentencing, Coy maintained his actions were justified and plans to appeal, while Hill's family described him as a gentle man. The case highlighted issues of police accountability and followed a series of fatal police shootings of Black people.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction. They argue that a non-prosecution agreement made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida should have protected her from criminal charges in New York, as it extended to his co-conspirators. The defense contends that the government's promise of immunity must be honored nationwide to maintain trust in the justice system. Federal prosecutors have maintained that the agreement was geographically limited to Florida and does not apply to Maxwell, who was not a party to the original deal.</p>

However, analysts stress that the final details are crucial, as complexities like quotas on UK car exports and unresolved tariffs on steel and pharmaceuticals could alter the real-world impact.

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located approximately 895 miles southeast of Honolulu. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Iona to strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week. The hurricane's projected path is westward, and confidence is high that it will remain well south of the Hawaiian Islands, posing no immediate threat to land.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has expressed "deep concern" over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to dismiss all members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The independent panel provides evidence-based recommendations for crucial preventive care, such as cancer screenings, which insurers are required to cover under the Affordable Care Act. The AMA urged Kennedy to retain the task force members to ensure their non-partisan work continues uninterrupted.

          <p>Portuguese forward João Félix, once the third most expensive transfer in history, is set to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr from Chelsea. This move is seen by many as a step down for the 25-year-old, whose career has not lived up to its early promise since his £113m transfer to Atletico Madrid in 2019. Despite playing for top European clubs, he has struggled for consistency and has never scored more than 10 goals in a season since leaving his home club, Benfica. Journalists and pundits suggest a combination of mentality and an inability to adapt to modern football's defensive demands has hindered his potential.</p>

          <p>As more Americans face financial distress, this article outlines three significant risks associated with filing for bankruptcy. A primary consequence is a severe and long-lasting hit to one's credit score, making it difficult to secure loans for up to a decade. Another risk is the potential loss of valuable assets, as a court-appointed trustee may sell non-exempt property to repay creditors, with exemption laws varying by state. Finally, a bankruptcy filing can limit future personal and professional opportunities, as it is a public record accessible to potential employers and landlords. (not investment advice)</p>
