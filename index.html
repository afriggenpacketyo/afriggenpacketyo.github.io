          <p>Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, is reportedly seeking to raise $15 billion to $20 billion in a private placement, which could value the crypto company at approximately $500 billion. This ambitious valuation would place Tether alongside major private tech firms like OpenAI and SpaceX. The move comes as Tether plans a return to the U.S. market, launching a new regulated token, USAT, for businesses and institutions. Talks are in early stages, so details may change, but the company is advancing its U.S. presence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva used his UN address to strongly criticize Washington's tariffs and military actions, advocating for closer ties with China and global institutional reform. This came amidst heightened U.S.-Brazil tensions, including 50% tariffs imposed by Trump. Surprisingly, after Lula's speech, President Trump proposed a meeting next week, citing "excellent chemistry" from a brief encounter. This unexpected overture suggests a potential for dialogue despite the public rebukes.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media and Sinclair, two major owners of ABC-affiliated television stations, announced they will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" from their broadcasts, even after ABC reinstated the show. This decision follows Kimmel's controversial comments regarding the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which led to the show's initial suspension. Both companies cited a need for "respectful, constructive dialogue" and will continue local programming. Nexstar's pending $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna requires FCC approval, adding a layer of corporate motivation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr's threats against TV networks, specifically regarding Jimmy Kimmel's show, are being criticized as antithetical to the agency's mission of fostering free speech. Carr's suggestion of revoking licenses for programs deemed offensive is highly unusual and legally complex, as the First Amendment largely prevents the FCC from acting as a "programming police." The article suggests Carr's actions are aimed at pleasing President Trump and leveraging the FCC's power over mergers and acquisitions, rather than realistic license revocations.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a decree classifying Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, citing it as an "anarchist enterprise" using violence to overthrow the government. This move follows Trump's earlier allegations linking the "radical left" to the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Legal experts and agencies like the FBI have previously stated that classifying Antifa as a terrorist organization is difficult due to its lack of formal structure.

          <p>A bull moose that fell into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well in Pembroke, Maine, was successfully rescued in a five-hour operation by Maine wardens. The moose was discovered by a landowner who spotted its antlers. Wildlife biologists sedated the animal, allowing wardens to use an excavator to carefully lift it to safety. The moose quickly recovered and ran off after the sedation wore off. The well, previously unknown to the family, has since been capped to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank's recent interest rate cut was prompted by a weakening labor market, despite persistent inflation. Speaking in Providence, Rhode Island, Powell acknowledged a "challenging situation" with upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment, consistent with stagflationary conditions. He indicated comfort with the current policy path but left open the possibility of further cuts. The economic conditions present a policy dilemma for the Fed, balancing price stability with maximizing employment. (not investment advice)</p>
