Trump also mentioned Putin's potential participation in negotiations with Iran over their nuclear capabilities, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. The conversation, lasting over an hour, did not lead to immediate peace, but Trump reiterated his belief that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses Ukraine's drone attack on Russian military airfields, highlighting how it exposed vulnerabilities in modern warfare. The attack, dubbed Operation Spider's Web, destroyed strategic bombers and showcased the effectiveness of small, inexpensive drones in evading defenses. This event serves as a reminder that even advanced militaries are susceptible to asymmetric attacks using readily available technology. The article suggests this innovative use of drones will inspire similar attacks, potentially impacting future conflicts and defense strategies, including those of the United States.</p>

          <p>ABC News reports that the Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance requiring hospitals to perform emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The previous guidance mandated abortions in emergency departments, even in states where the procedure is illegal, if it served as a "stabilizing medical treatment." The Trump administration argues that the guidance does not reflect its policies, though it claims that EMTALA will continue to be enforced to protect individuals seeking emergency treatment. Abortion rights groups have criticized the move, fearing it will endanger women's lives.</p>

The article notes that the White House is attempting to downplay Musk's opposition, while key Republicans are carefully addressing his concerns.

          <p>NPR reports that Congressional forecasters estimate President Trump's tariffs could cut the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade, assuming they remain in place. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) notes significant uncertainties, including the potential for tariffs to discourage imports more than expected, leading to lower revenues. The forecast also assumes the tariffs in place in mid-May will become permanent, excluding subsequent changes. While the tariffs could reduce deficits, they are also projected to result in higher inflation and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The new policy, approved by Chancellor Merz's Cabinet, allows a country to be declared safe with a simple statutory order, removing the need for Bundesrat consent. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated this is part of a broader effort to implement an "asylum turnaround." Opposition lawmakers and NGOs have criticized the draft as contrary to German and international law. The reform still requires approval by the lower house of parliament.</p>
