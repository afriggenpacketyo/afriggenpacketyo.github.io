          <p>President Trump's new global tariffs, while seemingly logically consistent, are likely to backfire, according to this analysis.  The tariffs' formula, not based on actual trade barriers, creates impossible choices for other countries, potentially leading to retaliatory measures and a global trade war.  The author argues that a free trade agreement would have been a less risky approach to achieving the administration's stated goals, and that the tariffs are more likely to cause a recession than generate economic prosperity.</p>
