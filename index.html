          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act does not authorize President Trump to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The judge stated that the president's invocation of the act exceeded the scope of the statute, as the proclamation did not suggest an organized armed attack or a threat from Venezuela through TdA members. The ruling is significant as it directly addresses whether the government can use the AEA to deport alleged gang members.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a deal that would significantly weaken their oversight over religious schools, potentially benefiting the state's Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal has raised concerns among education experts, including the state education commissioner, who said such changes would compromise the future of young people attending religious schools that do not offer a basic secular education. The potential deal is the result of years of lobbying by Hasidic leaders and their political representatives.</p>

          <p>Stylist Misa Hylton is suing Mary J. Blige for $5 million, alleging that the singer undermined her business relationship with rapper Vado. The lawsuit claims Blige withheld Vado's completed album to pressure him into leaving Hylton behind. The attorney for Hylton stated that the friendship wasn't over because of the Vado album and the lawsuit wasn't brought because they're no longer friends. Rather, it was about a simple breach of contract with no communication for a year.</p>

The move comes as the company seeks to boost sales and revive its brand, which has lost some of its luster. The company will expand its "Green Apron service model," hiring new baristas and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders.</p>
