          <p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, has rejected the Trump administration's request to lift an order that blocks the deployment of federalized National Guard troops in the city. Judge Karin Immergut maintained her injunction, citing the government's previous attempt to evade her initial ruling and a pending review by a higher court. This decision is part of a series of legal battles over President Trump's authority to send military forces into cities over the objections of local officials.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "The Running Ground," The Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson reflects on running as both a form of meditation and a intense mental challenge. He describes how the simplicity of the sport allows for deep introspection, stripping away distractions and connecting the mind and body. Thompson contrasts the open-minded state of a casual run with the focused, disciplined mindset required for a workout or race, where he actively works to push past pain and self-doubt.</p>

While the ad accurately quoted Reagan's words criticizing trade barriers, it altered the original order and omitted key context, such as Reagan's justification for imposing tariffs on Japan at the time. The article breaks down how the minute-long ad resequenced sentences from the five-minute address to create a powerful but decontextualized message against protectionism.</p>

          <p>The East Wing of the White House has been completely demolished to make way for a new, $300 million ballroom project privately funded by President Trump's donors. Satellite images confirmed the historic structure has been reduced to rubble, sparking outrage from historians and preservation groups who argue the demolition bypassed legally required public reviews. This move contradicts an earlier promise that the existing White House infrastructure would remain untouched, with senior officials now indicating the new ballroom will likely be named after Trump himself.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and accused of being a major fentanyl trafficker, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States. The transfer was facilitated by the Mexican government, from which Zhang had previously escaped house arrest. U.S. authorities allege Zhang ran a vast international drug trafficking and money laundering operation, working closely with Mexican cartels to import fentanyl and cocaine into multiple U.S. states, representing a significant law enforcement victory in the fight against the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 20 nations supporting Ukraine has pledged to remove Russian oil and gas from the global market to suffocate funding for President Vladimir Putin's war efforts. The announcement came after a summit in London, where leaders agreed on a plan to increase economic pressure on Moscow, including targeting Russia's sovereign assets to help finance Ukraine's defense. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated the coalition is united in "choking off funding for Russia's war machine" as Putin is not serious about peace.</p>

          <p>Senior administration officials have indicated that President Donald Trump will likely name the new, privately-funded $300 million White House ballroom after himself. The project, which involved the controversial demolition of the entire East Wing, is already being referred to internally as "The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom." The White House confirmed that fundraising has exceeded the construction cost, reaching $350 million, though it did not specify how the additional $50 million would be used.</p>

          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions revealed that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because a top national security official would not testify that China was considered an "enemy" of the state. Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Collins was reportedly unwilling to state that China posed a direct risk to national security during the period of the alleged offenses. This testimony was deemed essential for prosecution under the Official Secrets Act, and its absence proved "fatal to the case."</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a cooler pace than the 3.1% forecast by economists. This report, released amid a government shutdown to facilitate Social Security adjustments, suggests that the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices remains somewhat muted. The benign inflation data could strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to implement another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to support a slowing job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dahbia Benkired, 27, has been given a whole-life sentence for the 2022 murder and sexual assault of 12-year-old Lola Daviet, a case that horrified France. This is the country's most severe penalty and is rarely imposed, making Benkired the first woman to receive it. The court cited the "extreme cruelty" and "true torture" inflicted upon the victim, whose body was found in a storage box in her building's courtyard. The case has also been a focal point for political debate as Benkired was an immigrant under an order to leave France.</p>
