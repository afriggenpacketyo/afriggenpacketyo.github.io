        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major pornography websites in the United Kingdom have seen a significant drop in user traffic since the enforcement of new age verification rules under the Online Safety Act. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows top sites like Pornhub experienced a nearly 50% decrease in visitors after the enhanced checks were introduced on July 25 to prevent access for under-18s. Conversely, the use of VPNs, which can bypass these location-based restrictions, has surged, and some smaller, non-compliant sites have seen an increase in traffic. This trend raises concerns that users may be driven towards less regulated and potentially more extreme content online.</p>

          <p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has acknowledged that he fished without the required rod licence during a diplomatic engagement with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Chevening House. Lammy attributed the incident to an "administrative error" and has since purchased a licence and notified the Environment Agency of the mistake. While the Foreign Secretary did not catch any fish, the oversight could have resulted in a fine of up to £2,500. The Environment Agency confirmed the relevant licences have now been purchased but did not state whether a fine was issued.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a list of 11 individuals to succeed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve Chairman when his term concludes in May. According to sources, the list includes previously unmentioned names like Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside known candidates such as Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is said to be leading a "deliberative process" to interview all candidates and narrow the list for the president's final decision. This extensive process suggests a decision is not imminent, potentially avoiding market disruption from a long-term "shadow Fed chair." (not investment advice)</p>

French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that Trump intends to push for an immediate ceasefire during the meeting. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for continued sanctions and pressure on Russia, expressing hope that a ceasefire will be the central topic of the U.S.-Russia talks.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave dropped 17% after the company reported a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analysts' expectations. The stock's decline also coincides with the upcoming expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more volatility. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance, citing that demand for its AI infrastructure continues to outpace supply. However, some analysts expressed disappointment with the guidance and noted a delay in capital expenditures as a potential weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hashem Abedi, who is serving a minimum 55-year sentence for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, has been charged with the attempted murder of three prison officers. The alleged attack occurred on April 11 at HMP Frankland, a high-security prison in County Durham, and also includes charges of assaulting a fourth guard and possessing an unauthorized knife. Abedi, the brother of suicide bomber Salman Abedi, is accused of using makeshift weapons in the incident.

Newsom's proposed maps aim to eliminate up to five Republican-held seats in California, escalating a partisan battle over gerrymandering with significant national implications.

A recent poll shows that 76% of Ukrainians oppose making concessions to Russia, reflecting a widespread belief that Vladimir Putin is not genuinely interested in peace. Ukrainian analysts believe that any deal struck between Trump and Putin without Ukrainian participation is unlikely to be implemented, as it would face strong resistance from both Ukraine and its European allies.

Critics and former officials argue the changes undermine the report's credibility, which has long been a vital resource for human rights defenders globally.

The case went cold for over two decades until 2014, when forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick used public databases to link crime scene DNA to the surname Miller. This led cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf to Bryan Patrick Miller, a man known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona. After obtaining Miller's DNA through an undercover sting, investigators confirmed he was the killer, leading to his arrest, trial, and eventual death sentence in 2023.</p>

The virus, typically spread by biting insects, is not harmful to humans or other animals and usually does not injure the rabbits unless the growths obstruct their vision or mouth.

After Trump suggested the bank's CEO should "get a new Economist," Goldman economist David Mericle reaffirmed the firm's research, estimating that consumers would absorb about two-thirds of the tariff costs by the fall. This would push a key inflation gauge to 3.2% by year's end.

          <p>Amazon has significantly expanded its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like meat, produce, and dairy in more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The move intensifies competition with rivals like Instacart and Walmart, and Amazon plans to extend the service to 2,300 locations by year's end. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25 and is part of a broader strategy to integrate grocery shopping more seamlessly into the Amazon ecosystem. The announcement led to a drop in the stock prices of competitors, signaling a potential escalation in the grocery delivery wars.</p>

          <p>FEWS NET, a critical U.S.-funded system designed to predict and prevent famines, is coming back online after being shut down by the Trump administration in January. Created in 1985 in response to the Ethiopian famine, the network provides vital data that allows governments and aid organizations to pre-position food and avert humanitarian crises. Its shutdown created a dangerous information gap, particularly in vulnerable regions like Ethiopia, which is currently on the brink of another major food crisis. While humanitarian experts welcome its return, questions remain about the revived system's budget, scope, and ability to trigger timely action.</p>

          <p>British Conservative MP and Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp reported being threatened with a knife and pelted with bottles while visiting a migrant camp in northern France. Philp was in the area to investigate the ongoing migrant crisis when the incident occurred. In a video posted to social media, a journalist accompanying him described a man swinging a machete-like weapon, seemingly to intimidate others from speaking. The event highlights the tense situation at the Channel coast as the UK government grapples with increasing numbers of small boat crossings and implements new policies to address the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariffs are causing significant price increases for imported goods like coffee, tea, and spices, placing a heavy burden on small businesses. Coffee prices, for example, surged 14.5% year-over-year in July, forcing shop owners to pass costs onto consumers. Importers of specialty products sourced from countries like India and China have little choice but to pay the higher duties, which they say devastates their already slim profit margins. Business owners fear that these tariffs, intended to penalize other countries, are primarily harming American small businesses and could ultimately reduce product diversity for consumers.

          <p>As Iraq suffers from nationwide power outages and extreme summer heat, millions of citizens are relying on a network of private diesel generators for electricity. While these generators are a lifeline, allowing homes and businesses to function, they are also a significant burden, costing households hundreds of dollars monthly and creating a lucrative, unregulated industry. Furthermore, these machines contribute to severe air and noise pollution, posing serious public health risks and exacerbating the environmental issues that contribute to the country's climate woes.

A government spokesperson stated, "There is no censorship in Germany," defending the country's high standards of free speech. The report, which has been widely criticized by human rights groups for being politically altered by the Trump administration, also softened its criticism of countries like Israel and El Salvador while increasing scrutiny of others.

          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that alcohol consumption among U.S. adults has fallen to its lowest level on record, with only 54% reporting that they drink. For the first time, a majority of Americans (53%) now view even moderate drinking as harmful to one's health, a significant increase from previous years. This shift in perception is accompanied by a decline in regular drinking, with the average weekly intake dropping to 2.8 drinks, the lowest since 1996. Researchers suggest this trend is driven by growing health warnings and not by a shift to alternatives like recreational cannabis.</p>

          <p>New research shows that Planned Parenthood provided care for Medicaid patients in over 1.5 million visits in 2024, underscoring its vital role in the U.S. healthcare safety net. This role is now threatened by a provision in a recent Trump administration spending package that bans the organization from receiving Medicaid reimbursements, a move currently blocked by a court. Experts warn that if this "defunding" effort succeeds, it could cripple the healthcare system's ability to serve low-income populations, as other providers lack the capacity to absorb Planned Parenthood's patients. The impact would be particularly severe for contraception access and STI screening in underserved communities.</p>

The federal government contends the deployment was legal under Title 10, asserting the president had the authority to protect federal property and personnel during what he termed a "rebellion." The trial is examining whether the troops' actions, such as setting up roadblocks and detaining civilians, constituted unlawful law enforcement activities.</p>
