          <p>Amid escalating tensions, Israel conducted an attack on Iranian state television and issued warnings to approximately 330,000 residents in central Tehran to evacuate. This action followed a missile barrage from Iran that resulted in the deaths of at least eight Israeli civilians, according to the Israeli military. The strike on the television network disrupted a live broadcast, causing chaos and casualties among reporters. The United States State Department has raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, advising citizens against travel to the country, and House Speaker Mike Johnson postponed his planned address to Israel's parliament. The USS Nimitz carrier strike group is headed to the Middle East to give the U.S. two carrier strike groups in range of Iran.</p>

          <p>The Jane Goodall Institute's chimpanzee conservation project in Tanzania is facing significant setbacks due to funding cuts from USAid under the Trump administration. The Hope Through Action project, which aimed to protect endangered chimpanzees and their habitats through reforestation and community-led initiatives, will be impacted by the withdrawal of $29.5 million pledged over five years. In response, Ecosia, a climate action-focused search engine, has offered $100,000 over three years to support JGI Tanzania's Gombe reforestation project. This donation will fund the planting of 360,000 seedlings, helping to mitigate the impact of the defunding and continue conservation efforts. The project is built upon Jane Goodall's research, emphasizing the importance of cooperation between local people and the natural environment.</p>

          <p>Peter Stinson, a former Coast Guard lieutenant, has been charged with making threats against President Trump. According to an FBI affidavit, Stinson allegedly made numerous social media threats between 2020 and 2025, suggesting the use of a gun, knife, and poison against the president. Federal investigators also cited posts made within 48 hours of the 2024 attempted assassination of Mr. Trump. Stinson, who investigators say self-identified as a member of ANTIFA, faces up to five years in prison if convicted. Threats against politicians and public officials have been on the rise in recent years, including bomb threats and swatting calls.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear an appeal from Chevron, Exxon, and other oil and gas companies regarding lawsuits seeking compensation for coastal land loss and environmental degradation in Louisiana. The companies are contesting a 2024 federal appeals court decision that kept the lawsuits in state courts, allowing them to proceed to trial. Chevron argues that because their oil production and refining activities began during World War II as a federal contractor, the cases should be heard in federal court, which is perceived to be more business-friendly. Plaintiffs, representing Plaquemines and Jefferson Parish governments, assert that the appeal is a delay tactic to avoid accountability for environmental damage, as Louisiana has lost over 2,000 square miles of land in the past century.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's tax bill, addressing contentious issues such as Medicaid and state and local tax deductions (SALT). The Senate proposal includes steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes, while it also proposes permanently extending the $10,000 SALT deduction. This differs significantly from the House bill, which raises the deduction to $40,000 for households with incomes up to $500,000. The Senate version also aims to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, and make Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent. Senate Republicans are also calling for a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, higher than the House's limit.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on the Israel-Iran conflict has shifted from supporting Israeli strikes to distancing himself, creating uncertainty. Benjamin Netanyahu claims the attacks were coordinated with the U.S., but Trump has stated the U.S. was not involved. Trump's options include escalating the conflict under pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining the current course, or pulling back due to domestic concerns. Some within Trump's MAGA movement question U.S. involvement in the conflict, arguing it contradicts his "America First" policy. The pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson has criticized the administration's claims of non-involvement and suggested the U.S. should "drop Israel."</p>

The lawsuit highlights instances where firms promised pro bono work to avoid government targeting. The ABA also claims the administration's actions have had a chilling effect, making it difficult to find firms willing to represent it in pro bono cases.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reduced the hours of the nightly curfew in downtown L.A., allowing businesses to remain open later into the evening. The curfew, which was enacted in response to protests against President Trump's immigration crackdown, will now begin at 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. The mayor cited reduced crime and vandalism as reasons for the adjustment. The LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the downtown area to ensure safety. Since protests began on June 7, the LAPD has arrested 575 people, including 14 for looting.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer and Donald Trump finalized a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, which covers aerospace and the auto sector. The US president said Britain would have protection against future tariffs “because I like them”. Under the agreement, the UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs from the US, while the auto industry will have 10% tariffs, down from 25%. However, the steel industry still faces 25% tariffs, although the two leaders pledged to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. The US still seeks assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel, highlighting potential complications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was "void and illegal". Judge William Young stated that the cuts, which targeted research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), constituted unlawful discrimination. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The administration's move to slash NIH funding was part of a broader effort to shrink the federal government and national debt. The ruling only applies to some grants, with further claims to be decided after additional evidence is presented.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that State Farm General took advantage of homeowner’s lack of knowledge about rebuilding costs and set projected replacement costs far lower than the actual costs, leaving fire victims without enough money to replace or rebuild their homes. State Farm, California’s largest home insurer, has engaged in a “multi-faceted illegal scheme” that is designed to “reap enormous illicit profits by deceptively misleading over a million homeowners in California.
