            <p>China retaliated against U.S. tariffs by raising levies on U.S. goods to 125%, escalating trade tensions between the two economic superpowers. The Chinese government stated that the tariff increase renders U.S. goods uncompetitive in the Chinese market. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized China's trade practices, while Goldman Sachs lowered its China GDP forecast due to the trade war's impact. This tit-for-tat escalation raises concerns about the potential for a global economic slowdown and the disruption of supply chains.</p>

            <h2>Economists Doubt China Will Devalue Yuan to Offset U.S. Tariffs</h2>

            <p>Economists believe China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its yuan to counteract the impact of U.S. tariffs, fearing financial market instability. Despite recent weakening of the yuan, analysts anticipate the central bank will manage an orderly depreciation. Devaluation could trigger capital outflows, which policymakers are keen to avoid. The high U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports also limits the benefits of a weaker yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Fossilized genetic evidence indicates that Denisovans, an ancient human relative, expanded their range to the Taiwan Strait. The discovery of a jawbone aged 130,000â190,000 years old provides direct proof of their presence in the region. This finding challenges previous assumptions about their geographic limits and strengthens the genetic link between Denisovans and modern Asian populations. The fossil, named Penghu 1, is the farthest-reaching Denisovan fossil ever found.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariffs have raised concerns about the potential impact on global climate action. The tariffs, particularly those targeting China, could hinder the development and deployment of clean energy technologies. While some argue that the tariffs will primarily affect the US, others worry about the broader implications for global climate progress. Countries like China may divert clean energy tech sales to other regions, accelerating green energy adoption elsewhere.</p>
