          <p>State inspectors in Texas approved an emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, primarily children. Released records confirm the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but the specific details of the plan remain undisclosed. Despite advance weather warnings of potential flooding, the camp, which hosted over 650 campers and staff, did not evacuate to higher ground, raising questions about its preparedness for the tragedy. The incident has drawn intense scrutiny regarding the adequacy of both the camp's protocols and state oversight.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 23:26:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop in almost two years and extending a long-running deflationary trend. This decline, which was worse than anticipated, reflects intense price wars and weak demand within the economy. In contrast, the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight increase of 0.1%, returning to growth after four months of declines, partly due to a government subsidy program. However, economists remain cautious, warning that persistent industrial overcapacity and a weakening property sector could undermine a sustained recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Two Individuals Plead Guilty to Illegally Selling Rifle to Man Accused of Trump Assassination Attempt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 23:22:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has secured guilty pleas from two individuals, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, for their roles in illegally selling a rifle to Ryan Routh. Routh is the man charged with attempting to assassinate former President Trump at his Florida golf club last year. According to court filings, Cooper acted as a middleman for Oxendine, selling Routh an SKS-style rifle for $350 in cash, knowing he was a convicted felon prohibited from owning firearms. While the defendants claimed no prior knowledge of Routh's alleged plot, Cooper later admitted to lying to the FBI and deleting phone files to avoid involvement.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged seven Chinese nationals residing in Massachusetts in a multimillion-dollar marijuana trafficking operation that spanned the U.S. Northeast. The organization allegedly operated a network of illegal grow houses, using the profits to purchase luxury goods and homes. According to the Department of Justice, the scheme also involved smuggling other Chinese nationals into the country to work in the grow houses to pay off their smuggling-related debts. The arrests are part of "Operation Take Back America," a nationwide initiative targeting transnational criminal organizations and illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>The prospect of additional U.S. tariffs under a new Trump administration is raising concerns for the export-dependent economies of Japan and South Korea, two key American allies in Asia. Both nations are already grappling with economic slowdowns and would be further impacted by proposed 25% tariffs, particularly on their crucial auto and steel exports to the U.S. While Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate if the countries open their markets, economists warn the new levies could push Japan toward a technical recession.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reported that the number of arrests in its aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles has reached 2,792 since it began in early June. This new total indicates a significant acceleration, with nearly 1,200 arrests occurring in just over two weeks. The operation, which has involved federal agents, the National Guard, and U.S. Marines, has drawn widespread condemnation from local and state officials. They criticize the tactics for terrorizing immigrant communities and disrupting daily life, while the Trump administration continues to press its crackdown in the city.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on imported copper, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the impact of imports on American industry. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, and the U.S. imports about half of what it consumes, with Chile and Canada being the largest suppliers. The move, which is expected to take effect soon, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. The action is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to protect and promote domestic production. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed deal would reportedly include the release of ten living hostages and the remains of nine deceased ones.

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas have intensified focus on the operational capacity of the National Weather Service (NWS) following significant staffing cuts under the Trump administration. Since February, the agency has lost around 600 staff members, including meteorologists and hydrologists, leading to high vacancy rates in some offices. While experts note the NWS issued timely warnings for the Texas event, they caution that continued understaffing could compromise the agency's ability to respond to future disasters.

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended introducing judge-only trials for some offenses in England and Wales to address a massive court case backlog of nearly 77,000. The proposals, aimed at preventing a "total system collapse," suggest that cases like fraud and bribery could be decided by judges alone. Other recommendations include creating a new court division with judges and magistrates for less serious offenses to speed up the justice process. While supporters believe this will reduce delays, some legal professionals argue that removing juries undermines the fundamental right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

This article explores why the genre has struggled to have a cultural reckoning similar to the 'MeToo' movement in Hollywood. Insiders and activists point to a culture of silence, the misuse of non-disclosure agreements, and a phenomenon of "black protectionism," where the community is hesitant to criticize its successful figures. While the Combs verdict and other recent allegations against hip-hop titans may signal a shift, many argue that systemic changes are needed to truly address the issue.</p>
