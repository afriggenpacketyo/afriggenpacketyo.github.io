          <p>Taiwan is in a state of uncertainty as it awaits the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States regarding potential tariffs. The Trump administration had previously announced worldwide tariffs, including a 32% rate for Taiwan, but paused them for 90 days to allow for negotiations. While Taiwanese and U.S. officials have met multiple times, no deal has been announced yet. Analysts suggest the continued talks are a positive sign that both sides are working towards a manageable solution, which is crucial for Taiwan as a major supplier of advanced semiconductors to top American tech firms.</p>

Founded by Jack Dorsey, the company has expanded from payment terminals into a broader range of financial services, including cryptocurrency and lending, reflecting its 2021 name change to emphasize its focus on blockchain.

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally requested a court to unseal grand jury records related to federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, following a directive from President Trump. This move comes after public pressure for greater transparency, although the administration maintains the conclusions of its initial review, which found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail. The filing emphasizes that transparency is a priority but will not compromise the protection of victims, whose information will be redacted. The request asks the court to recognize the significant public interest in the case and release the transcripts.</p>

          <p>The FBI has secured dozens of convictions in a massive $250 million fraud scheme in Minnesota that exploited a federal child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic. FBI Director Kash Patel described the "Feeding our Future" case as one of the worst in the state's history, where conspirators created fake food distribution sites and laundered money intended to feed hungry children. So far, 70 people have been indicted and 38 have pleaded guilty to using the funds for personal luxuries like mansions and cars. The investigation remains ongoing, with officials vowing to hold all those who betrayed the public trust accountable.</p>

          <p>Ten Americans detained in Venezuela, including a former Navy SEAL, have been released and are returning to the U.S. as part of a complex prisoner exchange involving the United States, Venezuela, and El Salvador. The deal saw El Salvador send 252 Venezuelan nationals, who were deported from the U.S. and accused of gang ties, from its CECOT prison to Venezuela. In return, Venezuela also freed dozens of its own political prisoners. U.S. officials described the negotiations as a "down-to-the-wire" humanitarian deal that secured the freedom of every American wrongfully detained in the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the U.S. Congress has increasingly surrendered its constitutional powers and responsibilities, particularly to the executive branch under President Trump. It highlights instances of Republican members of Congress publicly criticizing White House priorities but ultimately voting in favor of them, such as recent bills involving Medicaid cuts and budget rescissions. The author contends that this "preening cowardice" allows legislators to avoid political backlash but ultimately strengthens the presidency at the expense of the legislative branch. This trend, the article suggests, is a dangerous departure from the intended function of Congress.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, about two-thirds, are in favor of the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also shows that the 1969 moon landing is still viewed by a large majority as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. These positive public sentiments for space exploration cut across most political and ideological lines, suggesting a broad consensus on the value of the nation's space program.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and two reporters over an article alleging he sent a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.

The lawsuit was filed in a Florida federal court shortly after he publicly threatened legal action.

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump has introduced a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visa holders, including international students and temporary foreign workers.

While the fee may be reimbursed if visa holders comply with all restrictions, the mechanism for collection and reimbursement has not yet been established.

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show" franchise, with Stephen Colbert's tenure ending in May 2026, a move the network attributes to purely financial reasons. This decision reflects the broader struggles of late-night television, which faces declining linear viewership, high production costs, and competition from streaming and digital media. Despite Colbert's show consistently leading in ratings, the genre's cultural and financial value has diminished significantly since its heyday. The cancellation of such an established brand underscores the dramatic shifts in the media landscape and the challenges facing traditional broadcast formats.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Flash Flood Threat as Amber Weather Warning Issued for Thunderstorms</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom, particularly southeast England, are under an amber weather warning for dangerous flash flooding and torrential rain expected over the weekend. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours on Saturday morning, leading to fast-flowing, deep floodwaters. This severe weather comes just days after a heatwave left the ground parched and less able to absorb water, exacerbating the flood risk. Authorities are warning of likely home and business flooding, significant transport disruption, and potential power cuts from the severe thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on 18 Russian military intelligence officers and three GRU units for conducting a "sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity." The UK Foreign Office stated that the spies were working to "spread chaos and disorder" by targeting UK media, infrastructure, and political institutions, linking the activity to Russia's efforts to destabilize Europe. This action represents the UK's largest move against Russian spies since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings. The sanctions are part of a broader European effort to increase pressure on Moscow amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Increased production of rare earth minerals in Myanmar, largely to meet demand from China, is causing significant downstream environmental damage in neighboring Thailand. These minerals are essential for modern technology, but their extraction process in Myanmar is poorly regulated, leading to pollution of waterways that flow into Thailand. This cross-border contamination raises serious health and environmental concerns for Thai communities that rely on these water sources. The situation highlights the hidden environmental costs associated with the global technology supply chain and China's dominance in the rare earths market.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics plunged by over 30% amid growing concerns about the safety and future of its gene therapy, Elevidys. The FDA is reportedly investigating two patient deaths tied to the treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may ask the company to voluntarily halt shipments. The therapy has been controversial since its approval, as its clinical benefit remains uncertain, making the safety risks particularly significant. With Elevidys accounting for more than half of the company's revenue, the potential for the FDA to pull the drug from the market poses an existential threat to Sarepta. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the news of CBS canceling "The Late Show," President Trump expressed his delight on social media, calling Stephen Colbert a "complete and total loser" with no talent. He then took aim at other late-night personalities, suggesting that ABC's Jimmy Kimmel is "next" and deriding NBC's Jimmy Fallon, while praising Fox News host Greg Gutfeld. This reaction follows a history of public feuding between Trump and Colbert, whose show frequently criticized the administration. The cancellation has also drawn criticism from other hosts and politicians who question the timing and motives behind the network's decision.</p>

          <p>The cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is being viewed as symbolic of the end of an era for political comedy, a genre that rose to prominence with Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show." While CBS cites financial reasons, the move comes amid political pressure on its parent company, Paramount, raising questions about its motives. The article traces how late-night political satire, once a powerful tool for critiquing the Bush administration, struggled to maintain its urgency and relevance through the Obama and Trump years. Once a cutting-edge format, it became an established institution, losing its rebellious appeal and cultural bite.</p>

          <p>Police have linked the killing of a 37-year-old mother in Garden Grove, California, to an attempted murder-suicide in Stockton. The victim, Crystal Gonzalez, was found dead in her home by officers conducting a welfare check, while her two young children were present but unharmed. Investigators believe her husband, Miguel Lopez, 35, killed her before driving more than 300 miles north to Stockton. There, he critically shot another man before turning the gun on himself and dying at the scene. The tragic events have left two children orphaned as police continue to investigate the motive.</p>
