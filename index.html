          <p>Following an incident where a car crashed into pedestrians in Leicester, resulting in serious injuries to three people and minor injuries to one, police have made two more arrests. The incident occurred on De Montfort Street in the city center. A 31-year-old man had already been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing serious injury by dangerous driving but was released on police bail. The two newly arrested individuals include a 28-year-old man and a 34-year-old man, both from Leicester, with the 34-year-old also released on bail.</p>

          <p>China's delegation maintained a notably subdued presence at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security summit, sparking speculation and surprise. Unlike previous years, China's defense minister was absent, and a plenary session on China's security was canceled. This absence resulted in no bilateral talks between China and other nations, including the US, despite concerns regarding China's military capabilities. The Chinese delegation informed other countries that they would not be engaging in bilateral discussions during the dialogue, which has fueled speculation about China's strategic intentions in the region.</p>

          <p>Following a report by the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency indicating Iran is increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, Iranian Foreign Minister spoke with the agency's director, stressing Iran's commitment to ongoing cooperation. The IAEA report raised concerns, noting Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material. The Iranian Foreign Minister emphasized that all nuclear activities are within agreed frameworks and monitored by the IAEA. This conversation occurred shortly after Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi visited Tehran to present the latest U.S. proposal for ongoing talks aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's inconsistent approach to China, characterized by both aggression and weakness, increases the likelihood of conflict over Taiwan. Trump's economic pressure on China, combined with his perceived lack of commitment to defending Taiwan, creates a dangerous situation. China may be tempted to test Trump's resolve, potentially leading to a crisis in the region. The author suggests that Trump's policies, driven by self-interest and fear, undermine the US's credibility and embolden China's ambitions.</p>

          <p>A British man, John Miller, has been indicted in the US for allegedly conspiring to smuggle sensitive American military technology, including missiles and drones, to China. Miller and a Chinese man, Cui Guanghai, were arrested in Serbia and face potential extradition to the US. The alleged plot involved soliciting the procurement of US defense articles and attempting to harass an anti-Chinese government protester. The US Justice Department has condemned the actions as a blatant assault on national security and democratic values.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, supports the new Olympic age limit of 14 and older for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite its potential impact on medal prospects. World Skate's decision aims to reduce severe injuries among young athletes attempting increasingly difficult tricks. Japan's street skateboarding head coach, Daisuke Hayakawa, endorsed the restriction, emphasizing the risks associated with children lacking the necessary skills and physical maturity. While some Japanese medalists were younger, officials believe the change aligns with the IOC's policy to protect child athletes.</p>
