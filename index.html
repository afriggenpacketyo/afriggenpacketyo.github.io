          <p>The U.S. military has deployed its Typhon mid-range missile system to Japan for the first time as part of the annual Resolute Dragon joint training exercise. This marks the first deployment of such a weapons system in the Asia-Pacific region since the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the U.S. withdrew from. While U.S. officials state the system will be removed after the drills, the move is seen as a strategic message to China and could prompt Beijing to enhance its own counterstrike capabilities in response to the increased American military presence.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed former U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop illegal migrant crossings in the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for border policing and that the military's primary focus is on national defense. The statement came as a record number of migrants, approximately 32,000 so far this year, have made the crossing, highlighting ongoing challenges with the government's migration policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" due to its excessive length and florid detail. The judge criticized the filing for violating federal rules requiring concise allegations, but has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to submit a shorter, amended version. The lawsuit, which seeks $15 billion, is part of a series of legal actions Trump has taken against various media organizations.</p>

          <p>Over 100 members of the Writers Guild of America East protested outside Walt Disney Co.'s New York headquarters following ABC's decision to indefinitely suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". The protest condemned the move as an act of censorship and a capitulation to political pressure after Kimmel's remarks about the killing of a right-wing activist. The demonstration reflects growing anger in the creative community over what they see as an attack on free speech, fueled by threats from the FCC chairman regarding broadcast licenses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed his desire to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, after prosecutors in his office did not find sufficient evidence to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James with mortgage fraud. Sources indicate Siebert was pushed to bring charges regardless, and his refusal led to the decision for his removal, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department. The move has caused alarm among career prosecutors, who fear it represents a brazen attack on the rule of law and an escalation of a retribution campaign against political opponents.</p>

          <p>Retired boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas luxury car dealership, alleging deceptive trade practices and fraud. Mayweather claims the dealer sold him a 2018 Maybach Landaulet for $1.2 million, misrepresenting the price they paid for it and concealing that the vehicle had been involved in previous lawsuits. According to the boxer, the dealer actually paid only $728,000 for the car, overcharging him by nearly half a million dollars and failing to provide necessary legal documentation for the sale.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., though a final agreement has not yet been reached. The discussions aim to resolve national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, which faces a federal law requiring it to divest its American operations or face a ban. While Trump has expressed optimism about finalizing the deal, Chinese state media readouts have been more reserved, indicating that key details still need to be resolved between the two nations.</p>

This unified stance marks a shift from previous funding fights, as even moderate Democrats express confidence that the public will blame Republicans for any shutdown. The GOP-led House passed a "clean" continuing resolution, but it failed in the Senate, leaving Washington at a stalemate as lawmakers depart until after the funding deadline.</p>

In a significant shift for COVID-19, the committee moved away from a universal recommendation, instead advising that vaccination should be based on individual, informed decision-making in consultation with a healthcare provider.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a new welcome letter for newly naturalized U.S. citizens, which emphasizes assimilation and forging a "sacred bond" with the nation's culture, traditions, and history. This rhetoric marks a departure from letters by previous presidents, including Joe Biden and George W. Bush, which typically focused on the United States as a nation founded on ideals and democratic principles. The new letter reflects a broader shift on the political right to define American identity more by a shared culture than by a common creed or set of ideas.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: The FCC's Power to Regulate Broadcast Licenses Amid Political Threats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 16:19:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and the FCC Chairman to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have put a spotlight on the federal government's regulatory power over the media. Broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, and NBC rely on government-licensed public airwaves to operate, which requires them to serve the "public interest, convenience and necessity." While this power has historically been used to address issues like obscenity or children's programming, using it to punish political speech is viewed by legal experts as an unprecedented and dangerous step that would likely face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to introduce a new $100,000 application fee for the H-1B visa program, which is used by companies to hire highly-skilled foreign workers. This significant fee increase is part of a broader crackdown on immigration and targets a program that has been criticized for potentially undercutting American workers' wages. The H-1B program has been a crucial tool for the technology sector to fill specialized roles, and the new policy is expected to have a major impact on companies that rely on it.</p>
