          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris critiques former President Joe Biden's decision to seek reelection, suggesting it was a "recklessness" driven by personal ego and ambition rather than a broader strategic consideration. Harris writes that the stakes were too high for such a choice to be left to an individual and also claims Biden's inner circle often failed to defend her from negative narratives. She does, however, maintain that even on his worst day, Biden was more capable and compassionate than Donald Trump.</p>

These initiatives aim to convey the historical significance, national trauma, and sense of unity that followed the attacks, ensuring the lessons of that day are not forgotten.</p>

          <p>In a rare moment of unity, American politicians from both major parties have jointly condemned the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. President Trump, who announced Kirk's death, was joined by former presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton in denouncing the political violence. Leaders in Congress, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, also issued strong statements, calling for civility and emphasizing that violence has no place in the nation's political discourse.</p>

          <p>A White House adviser has called for the U.S. to defend its lead in artificial intelligence by exporting integrated "AI tech stacks" to foreign partners. This strategy involves packaging not just advanced chips but also algorithms and applications to create a cohesive American AI ecosystem abroad. The goal is to prevent China from gaining global market share and to ensure allies are integrated into the U.S. technology supply chain, addressing concerns that America's competitive gap over China is narrowing significantly.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Uber by a 23-year-old woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint after her driver kicked her out of the vehicle for vomiting. The suit claims the driver abandoned her in an unsafe Sacramento neighborhood, miles from her destination and without her phone or keys. She was then approached by two individuals who offered help but instead took her to an apartment where the assault occurred. The lawsuit accuses Uber of failing its duty of care and being unresponsive when the incident was reported.</p>

          <p>England's T20 cricket match against South Africa descended into what captain Harry Brook called a "shambles" due to persistent rain in Cardiff. After a long delay, the match was reduced to nine overs per side, but another downpour forced a revision to England's target, giving them only five overs to bat. England ultimately fell short, losing the opening match of the series. Brook expressed frustration with the chaotic conditions, stating that no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from such a disjointed contest.</p>

          <p>The UK's Treasury Committee has issued a warning that the government's reforms to the Lifetime ISA (LISA) savings product are insufficient and too slow. MPs argue that LISAs are being mis-sold and are unsuitable for many savers, particularly those who might later need to claim benefits. Citing the program's £3 billion cost over five years and evidence that most users could have bought a home without it, the committee is urging ministers to implement more significant changes in the upcoming November Budget.</p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating Australia's peacock spiders, a group with over 100 dazzlingly diverse species, to unlock the secrets of evolution. They hypothesize that the spiders' extraordinary variety may be linked to their large amount of "dark DNA"—the vast, non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. By studying how this dark DNA influences traits, scientists hope to understand the fundamental processes that generate biodiversity not just in these spiders, but across the natural world.</p>

          <p>Wolfgang Ischinger, a prominent European security expert, has expressed growing concern over the formation of a potential "anti-Western alliance" involving China, Russia, North Korea, and India. Citing recent high-level meetings between the nations' leaders, he warns of a coordinated effort to establish a new global order based on military power and repressive governance. Other analysts concur, noting a deep "psychological decoupling" from the West and the emergence of a functional, if not formal, partnership that challenges the existing international system.</p>

The vote, 261 to 167, represents a major effort by Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over declaring war, which lawmakers argue has been abused by multiple presidential administrations. The amendment, attached to the annual defense bill, reflects a growing consensus that these decades-old authorizations are obsolete and should be revoked.</p>
