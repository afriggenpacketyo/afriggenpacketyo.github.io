            <p>A shooting at Florida State University in Tallahassee resulted in two fatalities and six injuries. The suspect, Phoenix Ikner, a 20-year-old FSU student and son of a Leon County sheriff's deputy, was apprehended after being shot by police. The incident occurred near the student union, prompting a campus-wide lockdown and cancellation of classes. The investigation is ongoing to determine the motive and circumstances surrounding the shooting, with multiple law enforcement agencies involved, including the FBI. The community is in mourning and the university is offering counseling services to those affected. Optimism score: 5</p>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a significant funding shortfall after the government provided less compensation for tax increases compared to the police. While police forces received full coverage for the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions, fire services only received about 50% on average. This discrepancy could result in a £20 million shortfall for fire services, potentially impacting their ability to maintain fully-staffed fire engines. The National Fire Chiefs Council is urging the government to address the funding gap to ensure the continued safety of communities. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>Michigan is experiencing its first measles outbreak since 2019, with three confirmed cases in Montcalm County and a total of seven cases statewide this year.

            <p>A pilot project called SeaCURE has begun operating on England's south coast to test the feasibility of removing carbon from seawater as a method of combating climate change. The project extracts carbon from seawater, concentrates it, and returns the low-carbon water to the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. While still in its early stages, the project aims to determine if ocean-based carbon capture can be a cost-effective and scalable approach to reducing greenhouse gases. The project has £3m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.

            <p>Japan's inflation rate reached 3.6% year-on-year in March, surpassing the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the third straight year. The "core-core" inflation rate, excluding fresh food and energy, rose to 2.9%. The data comes amidst ongoing trade talks with the U.S., where tariffs from the U.S. loom. While strong inflation could allow the BOJ to raise interest rates, the potential impact of tariffs on Japan's GDP may constrain their ability to do so. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 55</p>
