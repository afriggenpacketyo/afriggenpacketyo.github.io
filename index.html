          <p>Economists anticipate the Bureau of Labor Statistics will issue a significant downward revision to U.S. jobs data, potentially showing that hundreds of thousands fewer jobs were created through March 2025 than initially reported. This revision, based on more comprehensive quarterly census data, could indicate that the labor market slowdown began much earlier than recent reports suggest. The potential weakening of the job market is intensifying discussions around the Federal Reserve's next move, with markets now fully expecting an interest rate cut at the upcoming September meeting to support the stalling economy.

          <p>Congressional Democrats have publicly released an image of a purported 2003 birthday letter from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which was part of a "birthday book" compiled for the disgraced financier. The note contains a hand-drawn sketch and a cryptic message, with a signature that the White House vehemently denies is authentic. The release is part of the House Oversight Committee's investigation into Epstein's records, intensifying scrutiny over the former president's past association with Epstein and leading to renewed legal threats of defamation from Trump's team against news organizations.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of 890 demonstrators at a London protest, members of the UK Parliament are pressuring the government to reconsider its decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Critics, including Labour MPs, argue that the ban dilutes the meaning of terrorism and infringes on free speech, noting that many arrested were peacefully protesting the ban itself, not supporting violence. However, Security Minister Dan Jarvis defended the proscription, stating that the group has connections to terrorism and that its actions are distinct from legitimate, peaceful support for Palestinian rights.</p>

          <p>The federal trial of Ryan Routh, who is accused of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in September 2024, began with jury selection in Fort Pierce, Florida. Routh, who is representing himself, posed a series of unusual questions to potential jurors regarding topics like the war in Gaza and turtles on the road, which the judge dismissed as irrelevant. The proceedings also saw Routh withdraw potential witnesses and complain about his sleeping conditions in jail. Routh faces life in prison if convicted on charges including attempted assassination and assaulting a federal officer.</p>

          <p>Shares of online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge, climbing over 15% after S&P Global announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This inclusion, which follows months of speculation, is a major milestone for the company as it typically triggers substantial stock purchases from passive index funds that track the S&P 500. The stock has performed exceptionally well this year, with its value increasing by more than 210% year-to-date.

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous artist Banksy appeared on the historic Royal Courts of Justice in London, depicting a judge using a gavel to beat a protester holding a blank, blood-splattered sign. Banksy confirmed the work on his Instagram, which activists have interpreted as a commentary on the UK government's recent ban of the protest group Palestine Action. Despite the attention, authorities quickly covered the artwork and announced its removal, citing legal obligations to preserve the 143-year-old listed building's original character. The removal highlights the ongoing conflict between contemporary street art and the preservation of historic sites.</p>

          <p>While Medicare Part A is typically free for eligible seniors, Part B requires a monthly premium, which stands at $185 in 2025, creating a financial burden for those on fixed incomes. This article explains that completely avoiding the premium is rare, but options exist to delay enrollment or receive financial assistance. Seniors still working with creditable employer health insurance can postpone Part B enrollment without penalty. Additionally, low-income individuals may qualify for Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid, which can cover the premium. However, forgoing Part B can restrict access to crucial supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

While both currently offer attractive rates in the 4% range, a key difference is that a CD locks in its rate for the entire term, protecting against future declines. Conversely, a high-yield savings account offers liquidity, allowing access to funds without penalty, which is crucial if the money might be needed unexpectedly. Savers should weigh the long-term earning potential of a fixed-rate CD against the flexibility of a variable-rate savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

Homeowners should also weigh the risk of waiting for even lower rates against the potential for them to rise unexpectedly. Finally, it is essential to calculate the closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and ensure long-term plans for the home make the refinance financially sensible.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has increased its settlement offer to clergy sexual abuse survivors to a minimum of $230 million in an effort to secure approval for its bankruptcy plan. This new figure is a $50 million increase from a previous proposal that many victims were advised to reject as inadequate. The settlement, which would resolve claims from 660 individuals, comes from the archdiocese and its smaller insurers, but still allows survivors to pursue additional funds from the primary insurer, Travelers. For the plan to be approved, it must be accepted by two-thirds of the voting claimants in the bankruptcy case.</p>

          <p>The 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly convenes this week, bringing together delegations from all 193 member states for the world's primary diplomatic forum. This year's agenda will cover pressing global issues including ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, climate change, and the governance of artificial intelligence. While the General Assembly's resolutions are non-binding, they serve as a crucial platform for nations to state their positions and build consensus, setting normative standards and often paving the way for legally enforceable international treaties. The session operates on a "one state, one vote" basis, giving all members equal representation.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing federal authorities to resume broad immigration raids in Los Angeles, this article provides a guide on individual rights during encounters with ICE agents. Legal experts and advocacy groups advise residents to keep their doors closed unless agents present a valid search warrant, which must be shown. Individuals have the right to remain silent and are not required to answer questions about their immigration status or sign any documents. If detained, a person has the right to contact an attorney. The guide also lists numerous local organizations that offer legal assistance and support for immigrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, traders are increasing their bets that the Federal Reserve might implement a significant half-percentage-point interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. While a quarter-point cut is still considered the most probable outcome, with market odds around 88%, the possibility of a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction is now being seriously considered. The dismal jobs data, showing minimal payroll growth and a rising unemployment rate, has solidified expectations for Fed easing to counteract a slowing economy. However, persistently high inflation data, due later this week, could complicate the decision for policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision to lift a lower court's injunction on certain ICE tactics in Los Angeles marks a significant development in immigration enforcement. The ruling, issued on the emergency "shadow docket" without a full majority opinion, allows federal agents to consider factors like apparent ethnicity and language when detaining individuals. Justice Kavanaugh argued in a concurrence that these factors can contribute to establishing reasonable suspicion. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sotomayor warned that the decision effectively legalizes the racial profiling of Latinos, representing a loss of constitutional freedoms. The case highlights the high legal barriers plaintiffs face when seeking to restrict law enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>France has been thrown into political turmoil after Prime Minister François Bayrou's government was defeated in a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The defeat forces Bayrou to resign, leaving President Emmanuel Macron to appoint the country's fifth prime minister in under two years. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's controversial budget proposal aimed at tackling France's massive national debt by freezing welfare payments and scrapping holidays. Lacking a majority, his government was brought down by a coalition of left-wing and hard-right opponents, deepening the political instability that has characterized Macron's second term.</p>

          <p>Confidence among U.S. workers in their ability to find a new job has fallen to an all-time low, according to the New York Federal Reserve's August Survey of Consumer Expectations. The survey revealed that the perceived probability of finding new employment after a job loss dropped to just 44.9%, the lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This data reflects a significant reversal from the "Great Resignation" period and points to a labor market that has cooled considerably. With hiring slowing dramatically, workers are becoming more hesitant to leave their current positions, a trend also reflected in declining quit rates. (not investment advice)</p>
