          <p>China has accused the United States of undermining preliminary trade agreements after the U.S. issued an industry warning against using Chinese chips. Beijing has demanded that the Trump administration correct its mistakes, calling the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance discriminatory and market distorting. China urged the U.S. to immediately correct its wrong practices and stop discriminatory measures against China. China stated that if the U.S. continues to damage China's interests, China will take resolute measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.</p>

          <p>Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has warned that Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating understates the threat to U.S. Treasuries. Dalio believes that the credit agency isn't taking into account the risk of the federal government simply printing money to pay its debt, which would cause bondholders to suffer losses from the decreased value of the money they're getting. Moody's had cut the U.S. credit rating one notch to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the federal government's ballooning budget deficit and soaring interest payments on the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nigerian women are advocating for reserved seats in parliament to address their systemic exclusion from the political process. The country's senate has only four women compared to 109 men, and female lawmakers occupy only 16 of the 360 seats in the House of Representatives. Gender rights advocates are supporting the 'Reserved Seat for Women bill,' which aims to reserve seats for women in federal and state legislatures. Supporters believe this legislation could lead to more inclusive governance, smarter policies, and a more stable economy, drawing comparisons to Rwanda's progress in gender equality and economic outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As inflation eases in 2025, lenders are offering differing rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). HELOCs typically offer lower variable rates that change with economic conditions, while home equity loans feature higher, fixed rates that remain stable throughout the term. The flexible draw periods and ongoing borrowing risk associated with HELOCs enable lower initial rates, whereas fixed rates on home equity loans command a premium due to the risk lenders assume. Both options can be beneficial for consolidating debt or funding major expenses.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement aimed at improving security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced after Brexit. The agreement seeks to strengthen ties between the two entities as the United States signals a reduced commitment to European security. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer aims for a "reset" of relations with the EU, almost nine years after the Brexit vote. The deal addresses politically sensitive issues such as fishing rights and includes plans for a youth program to facilitate travel and work between Britain and Europe.</p>

Chega, which means ‚Äúenough‚Äù in Portuguese, is the first hard-right party to gain ground in Portugal‚Äôs political scene since 1974, capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and economic resentments.</p>

          <p>A new "reset" deal between the UK and the EU aims to deepen ties in the UK's most important trading relationship, potentially boosting economic growth. The agreement reduces red tape and checks for foodstuffs, particularly benefiting producers and sellers between Britain and the EU.

While the government claims this agreement will be worth ¬£8.9bn to the UK by 2040, it would only recoup a small fraction of the GDP lost as a result of Brexit.</p>

          <p>President Trump‚Äôs tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, the heart of an industry that makes components for vehicles bound for the United States. The concern is high throughout the roughly 100 smaller auto-parts plants in Windsor and the surrounding county that employ some 9,000 workers. Many parts makers are small businesses without the financial cushion that auto giants can lean on to soften the blow from the 25 percent tariffs Mr. Trump applied to imported autos and some auto parts.</p>

Europe‚Äôs economy will grow more slowly than expected this year, dragged down by trade uncertainty from President Trump‚Äôs tariffs, despite increasingly stable prices on consumer goods and energy, according to European Union economists. The commission added that any de-escalation of the tensions between Europe and the United States set off by Mr. Trump‚Äôs imposition of a 10-percent import tax on European good could lead to stronger growth, as could new free trade agreements with other economic partners.</p>

Labour ministers have agreed a 12-year deal which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks and restrictions on food exports. The agreement was described as "disastrous" by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) while Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said it was a "great betrayal of our fishing fleet". But fish farming body Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal as a "slashing of red tape" which will allow Scottish products and people easier access to the EU.</p>
