            <p>A rare incident occurred in Cardigan Bay, Wales, where bottlenose dolphins were observed killing a common dolphin calf, leaving onlookers distraught. A cetacean expert suggests that climate change, leading to increased common dolphin populations in the area, might be a contributing factor, with bottlenose dolphins possibly engaging in such attacks as a form of 'play'. The UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme recovered the calf for autopsy, emphasizing the unusual nature of bottlenose dolphins attacking common dolphin juveniles, though it is common for them to attack porpoises.</p>

Roberts was one of the 'Fairbanks Four,' and the settlement concludes a long-running civil lawsuit alleging racial bias in the police investigation. The city maintains the settlement is not an admission of liability, but Roberts' attorneys consider it a vindication of his innocence.</p>

            <p>Small modular reactors (SMRs) are being hyped as a solution for climate change and data center power needs, but they are not a viable fix for California's energy needs. An analysis reveals that small reactors are less economical than large ones, and Trump's tariffs exacerbate the issue. Vogtle, the only new nuclear plant built in the U.S. recently, was extremely expensive, making nuclear power the most expensive power source.
