The lawsuit seeks to re-litigate legal questions that were previously decided against the group during pretrial proceedings and a trial in Federal District Court in Washington. The group claims that their rights were violated during the investigation and prosecution.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at rebuilding America's drone industry, tightening airspace security, and enhancing military readiness, which could potentially exclude Chinese manufacturers like DJI and Autel Robotics from the US market. Citing concerns about foreign-made drones endangering the public and compromising critical infrastructure, Trump's orders call for federal investment in US drone production to revitalize a sector currently dominated by Chinese competition. While the directives do not explicitly name specific countries or companies, they build upon previous efforts to restrict drones linked to foreign adversaries. DJI, based in Shenzhen, currently controls a significant portion of the US consumer drone market.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency that analyzes the budgetary impacts of bills, is facing criticism from Republicans after projecting that recent Republican legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Republicans, including President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have questioned the CBO's estimates, alleging bias and a lack of understanding of economic growth. The CBO was established in 1974 to provide Congress with objective information about the budgetary impacts of proposed bills, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget, and makes no policy recommendations.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent personnel cuts in the Pentagon office responsible for weapons testing have led to a halt in work and potential layoffs at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), a Pentagon-funded think tank. Hegseth's memo deemed much of the office's work "redundant" and "nonessential," leading to a significant reduction in the civilian workforce and the end of contractor support, including IDA's work. The cuts are projected to save the Pentagon over $300 million per year, but critics argue they will hinder the office's ability to fulfill its congressional obligations and oversee weapons testing effectively. GOP Sen. Roger Wicker has expressed concerns about the cuts, questioning their advisability and potential reversal of congressional policy.</p>

          <p>Apple's AI strategy is facing increased scrutiny as the company's initial foray into the field, Apple Intelligence, has been met with underwhelming reviews and setbacks. Despite advantages like a large installed base of iPhones and custom-designed chips, Apple has struggled to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google in launching new generative AI models. Investors are urging Apple to make significant strides in AI, particularly as some executives suggest that the technology could eventually replace the iPhone. While Apple has reportedly reorganized its AI teams, it faces renewed competition and must demonstrate a clear vision for its AI future at the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>

The endorsement comes after Cuomo faced attacks during the first mayoral primary debate regarding his administration's handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and the sexual harassment allegations against him.

A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts of illegally transporting migrants, alleging his participation in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented individuals from Texas to the interior of the country. The decision to pursue the indictment led to the resignation of a high-ranking federal prosecutor in Tennessee, raising concerns that the case is politically motivated.

The piece suggests that anti-managerialism is a central principle of the New Right, aiming to roll back bureaucratic control in various aspects of life.

It would also eliminate long-term care for undocumented immigrants starting in January and dental benefits in July 2026. Lawmakers argue that the proposal sets a dangerous precedent and have requested Newsom to maintain access to Medi-Cal for all state residents.

          <p>Elon Musk's willingness to spend his fortune on elections gives him a distinct advantage in driving chaos into the brittle party system and loosening Trump's hold on it. He could fund primary challenges against Republicans who support the legislation or start a new political party. Even a small party of disruption could multiply the targeted impact of a precision blast with a well-chosen 5 percent of the electorate in less than 10 percent of the seats. The short-term effect would be to help Democrats, and the system is indeed ripe for disruption.</p>

          <p>"We Are Guardians" is a documentary highlighting the efforts of Indigenous people to combat deforestation in the Amazon. The film juxtaposes the beauty of the rainforest with the devastation caused by illegal logging and mining, focusing on the "forest guardians" who confront loggers at great personal risk. It also features an activist working to increase Indigenous women's political representation and explores the perspectives of loggers and landowners caught in the complexities of the situation. While comprehensive in its scope, the documentary's style sometimes feels more like a highlighting of issues than an immersive journey.</p>

          <p>Tensions between President Trump and Elon Musk escalated after Trump withdrew Jared Isaacman's nomination for NASA administrator, who is a Musk ally, which followed Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill. The White House initially highlighted Musk's contributions to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but the relationship soured after Isaacman's nomination was pulled due to his ties with Musk. Trump claimed Musk was upset about cuts to electric vehicle tax credits in the bill, while Musk denied being shown the measure and criticized its "disgusting pork." The feud underscores the complex interplay between politics, business, and personal relationships at the highest levels of government.</p>
