          <p>Elon Musk has accused Apple of antitrust violations, alleging the company unfairly favors OpenAI's ChatGPT in its App Store. Musk's AI company, xAI, will pursue legal action, claiming Apple's practices make it impossible for its Grok chatbot to achieve top rankings. This threat comes despite Musk previously celebrating Grok reaching the number five spot among all free apps. The dispute highlights the escalating competition among major tech firms in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The nomination follows the recent firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed a slowdown in hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, questioning its methodology and data accuracy in the past. The move has drawn concern from some economists about the politicization of the agency responsible for crucial economic data, while the administration states it wants more reliable numbers.

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to manage the intense competition in China's "quick commerce" market. He argued that while the sector creates new consumption opportunities, the focus should be on curbing excessive cash burn and promoting high-quality development rather than stifling competition. The goal is to shift the industry from a zero-sum game to a win-win approach driven by innovation and an improved industrial ecosystem. This advice comes as e-commerce platforms are locked in a fierce battle for the instant retail market. (not investment advice)</p>

Her family scared the animal away after hearing her screams, and she was subsequently hospitalized. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located and euthanized the mountain lion found hiding on the property. While such attacks are rare, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the proximity of residential areas to wildlife habitats.</p>

The chase began in Lancaster and continued for two hours before the suspects abandoned their final stolen truck in downtown L.A. and escaped on foot. Authorities believe additional suspects may have been involved and recovered a loaded firearm from the first stolen vehicle.

          <p>Newly declassified documents reportedly show a Democratic whistleblower informed the FBI that Representative Adam Schiff approved the leaking of classified information to discredit then-President Donald Trump. The whistleblower, a former House Intelligence Committee staffer, allegedly characterized the actions as "treasonous" and "illegal" in interviews with the FBI. According to the report, the staffer claimed to have attended a meeting where Schiff explicitly greenlit the leaks. These allegations add a new dimension to the political conflicts that defined the previous administration.</p>

The White House stated the extension aims to address trade imbalances, unfair practices, and national security issues. This move temporarily averts further economic turmoil but underscores the persistent and complex trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

This discovery challenges existing models of how meltwater moves under ice sheets, which typically assume a one-way flow from the surface out to sea.

          <p>Colorado is battling several large wildfires, including the Lee fire, which has become the fifth-largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres. More than 1,000 firefighters are contending with dry, windy conditions that are fueling extreme fire behavior and have prompted evacuations in several mountain communities. The state has declared a disaster emergency to support the response efforts, as smoke from the blazes triggers air quality warnings. The situation highlights the increasing intensity of wildfire seasons across North America, driven by climate change-induced drought and heat.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Narrative on D.C. Crime Relies on False and Misleading Claims</h2>

          <p>A Guardian analysis argues that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C. is based on a false narrative of rampant crime, similar to his previous rhetoric about Los Angeles. The article points out that while Trump focuses on 2023 crime statistics, violent crime in D.C. is actually at a 30-year low and has dropped significantly in 2024 and 2025. Experts cited in the article state that the president's portrayal of the city as lawless is hyperbolic and contradicts official data. The move is framed as a political action rooted in misleading claims rather than factual public safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Employees at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI research, have issued a whistleblowing complaint warning that the organization is at risk of collapse. The complaint follows a threat from the UK's Technology Secretary to withdraw a £100 million grant unless the institute pivots its focus to defense and national security research. Staff have accused the leadership of misusing public funds and fostering a "toxic internal culture," concerns they say have been ignored. The crisis places the future of the prominent, publicly-funded research charity in serious jeopardy.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter revealed she feared her Black teammate, Lauren James, would face "astronomical" racist abuse if she had been the only player to miss a penalty in a crucial Euro 2025 shootout.

          <p>The mystery of a missing cyclist in Scotland was solved after a woman's quick thinking led police to his remains.

          <p>A large-scale manhunt in Montgomery County, Ohio, concluded with the arrest of an 18-year-old man found hiding in a sewer drain. The suspect, wanted in connection with armed robberies in Kentucky, had led police on a high-speed chase in a stolen vehicle before crashing and fleeing on foot. A shelter-in-place advisory was issued for the area after firearms were discovered in the vehicle. Dozens of SWAT team members were involved in the search, eventually locating the man submerged in water in the sewer system and taking him into custody.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine is a bilateral power play focused on himself and Vladimir Putin, leaving Ukrainian President Zelenskyy marginalized. During a press conference, Trump framed upcoming talks in Alaska as a two-person summit, ruling out Zelenskyy's participation and emphasizing a "land swapping" deal. A telling gaffe where he said he was "going to Russia" instead of Alaska revealed how central Putin is to his narrative. The approach positions Trump as the sole dealmaker but raises questions about the viability of any peace agreement reached without direct Ukrainian involvement.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, President Trump met with and praised Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, just days after publicly demanding his immediate resignation over alleged conflicts of interest related to China. Following the meeting, which included cabinet members, Trump called Tan's rise an "amazing story" and announced they would work on future suggestions. The sudden change in tone comes as the administration takes an increasingly active role in the semiconductor industry, recently striking a deal with Nvidia and AMD regarding their sales to China. The flip-flop highlights the administration's volatile but hands-on approach to corporate and trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue their partnership with Netflix, signing a new multi-year, first-look deal for film and television projects through their Archewell Productions company. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed content. The couple has produced several documentary series for the streamer, including the popular "Harry & Meghan" and a cooking show. The extension of their partnership indicates a continued, though modified, working relationship with the streaming giant.</p>
