          <p>President Trump has fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of a jobs report that showed significantly weaker growth than anticipated. In a social media post, Trump accused the commissioner, a Biden-era appointee, of faking numbers to influence the election and insisted on the need for accurate data. The move, confirmed by NBC News, came as markets reacted negatively to the report, which also included substantial downward revisions for the previous two months. This action has raised concerns among some financial analysts about the politicization of economic data and its potential impact on institutional integrity.</p>

The move is a reaction to Medvedev's social media posts, which warned that Trump's ultimatums regarding the war in Ukraine were a "step towards war" with the United States. Trump emphasized the importance of words and their potential for unintended consequences, expressing hope that the situation would not escalate further. The specific locations of the submarines were not disclosed, heightening geopolitical tensions between the two nuclear powers.</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla partially liable for a fatal 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, ordering the company to pay $329 million in damages. The incident occurred when a Model S, with its driver distracted, accelerated through an intersection, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' attorneys argued that Tesla irresponsibly marketed its technology, leading drivers to overestimate its capabilities and turning public roads into test tracks. This verdict represents a significant legal and financial blow to Tesla as it pushes to expand its autonomous driving technology and robotaxi fleets.</p>

          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the family of the late Virginia Giuffre have strongly criticized the Trump administration for transferring Ghislaine Maxwell to a minimum-security prison in Texas. They labeled the move, which occurred without their notification, as a form of "preferential treatment" for a convicted sex trafficker that "smacks of a cover up." The transfer followed meetings between Maxwell and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who is also Trump's former lawyer, fueling outrage and questions about potential leniency. The victims' statement expressed horror that the justice system was failing them while giving favorable treatment to a predator.</p>

The collaboration will integrate Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems, aiming for operational demonstrations by 2026. This initiative responds to evolving military needs highlighted by conflicts like the war in Ukraine, focusing on a craft that is smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable than traditional aircraft. The vehicle will initially be developed for surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics, marking a significant step in deploying advanced autonomous technology in battlefield operations.</p>

Owner Lizzette Barrios Gracián, a local teacher, established the space to provide a cultural hub for youth in a city she feels lacks such venues. The store serves as a gathering place for open mic nights, book clubs, and organizing, fostering a strong sense of community and belonging. Despite the financial challenges of running an independent bookstore, the focus remains on its mission to share "untold stories" and provide a safe, welcoming environment for everyone.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been moved from a low-security facility in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas.

Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence, and her case is awaiting a potential review by the Supreme Court. The move has intensified scrutiny on the Justice Department's handling of the case and its promise to release more information about Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended approximately $200 million in federal research funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing concerns over "antisemitism and bias." The university chancellor stated that the move will defund life-saving research and represents a loss for the nation. This action is part of a broader federal effort to pull funding from prominent universities accused of inadequately responding to antisemitism during campus protests. The decision comes shortly after UCLA settled a lawsuit with Jewish students and a DOJ investigation found the university was "deliberately indifferent" to a hostile environment during pro-Palestinian encampments.</p>

The change aligns with a Trump administration executive order to end government DEI programs and combat what it deems "illegal" private-sector mandates.

The visit, intended to assess the humanitarian situation, comes amid near-daily reports of deadly shootings near GHF locations, with the UN reporting hundreds of Palestinian casualties. Critics, including some Gazans and aid organizations like Oxfam, have denounced the visit as a "media stunt" that fails to address the root causes of the crisis.

With the average credit card APR hovering near a record 22%, interest charges continue to compound, making it difficult for many to make progress on their debt. The article argues that waiting for potential Fed rate cuts is an uncertain strategy, as any reductions are likely to be marginal and slow to impact consumer rates. For those already behind on payments or at risk of default, negotiating a reduced lump-sum payoff can offer a more immediate and effective path to financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Labor Market Shows Signs of a Steep Slowdown with Only 73,000 Jobs Added in July</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of estimates and raising concerns about the economy's trajectory. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised figures for May and June down by a combined 258,000, indicating near-zero growth in those months. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, and the household survey revealed a decline of 260,000 workers. The weak report, driven primarily by gains in the healthcare sector, intensified calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid escalating trade tensions and presidential criticism.

          <p>As more nations consider recognizing Palestine, this article explains the criteria and processes that define a state in international law. While the 1933 Montevideo Convention outlines four key attributes—territory, population, government, and diplomatic capacity—international recognition is a crucial, though less formalized, element for a state to function effectively. The path to full UN membership is complex, requiring approval from the Security Council, where permanent members hold veto power. This has been a barrier for widely recognized but non-member states like Palestine and Kosovo, highlighting that statehood is a fluid and often political process rather than a strictly legal one.</p>

          <p>An American Eagle ad campaign featuring actor Sydney Sweeney and a simple pun on "jeans" and "genes" has ignited a culture war, with some critics accusing it of being a "Nazi dog whistle." The article argues this controversy is a distraction from more serious issues, such as the Department of Homeland Security posting images on social media that evoke Manifest Destiny and white replacement theories. While commentators across the political spectrum debate the ad, the author suggests that focusing on a harmless pun overlooks genuinely concerning state-sanctioned rhetoric. The piece calls for prioritizing outrage on substantive matters over manufactured controversies in advertising.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman publicly explained their dissenting votes against holding interest rates steady, arguing the central bank is risking economic harm by waiting to ease policy. Both officials, who advocated for a quarter-point rate cut, believe the inflationary impact of tariffs is temporary and that a delay in action could lead to a deterioration in the labor market. Their rare public dissent came just before a report showed dismal job growth in July. They contended that the Fed's overly cautious "wait and see" approach fails to properly balance risks and could result in policy falling behind the curve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A single lightning flash that stretched 515 miles from eastern Texas to Missouri in 2017 has been officially recognized as a new world record for the longest horizontal distance. This continuous "megaflash" was documented using new satellite technology that allowed scientists to analyze its full extent, surpassing the previous 477-mile record set in 2020. While it was the longest, it was not the lengthiest in duration, lasting just over seven seconds. Researchers are excited by the technological advancements that made this discovery possible and anticipate that even greater lightning extremes will be observed as global measurement capabilities continue to improve.</p>

The museum stated the removal is pending a more substantial, funded overhaul of the entire exhibit, which has not been fully updated since 2008, to ensure all impeachments are included in a permanent display. The move follows a period of tension between the White House and the Smithsonian over content and alleged political bias, including a presidential executive order aimed at addressing "distorted" historical narratives.

Retailers are now facing difficult decisions about whether to absorb the increased costs or pass them on to customers. The ongoing trade disputes, particularly with China, have created a volatile environment, forcing businesses to reconsider their supply chains and delaying product development and releases.
