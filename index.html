        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Defense to be known as the Department of War, a move intended to project strength and resolve by reverting to its pre-1947 name. This rebrand, which could cost billions and potentially requires Congressional approval for permanence, aligns with Trump's stated goal of refocusing the department on a 'warfighting' ethos, shifting away from perceived 'woke ideology.' The order also instructs the Defence Secretary to recommend further legislative actions toward this permanent change. This development occurs shortly after China's unveiling of new military hardware, adding a significant geopolitical dimension to the discussion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a preliminary ruling, determining that Europe is dumping pork and pork by-products into the Chinese market, which has caused 'material injury' to its domestic industry. Effective September 10, importers of the affected European products will be mandated to provide corresponding deposits, calculated based on the margin determined for each company in this preliminary assessment. This decision signifies a notable escalation in trade tensions between China and the European Union, potentially leading to significant economic repercussions for European agricultural exporters and influencing global trade dynamics and consumer prices within China.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected Western proposals for a 'reassurance force' in Ukraine, warning that any deployed troops would be considered 'legitimate targets' by Russia. This declaration comes after a Paris summit where 26 of Ukraine's allies formally committed to deploying forces by land, sea, or air to provide post-war security, explicitly stating these troops would not be on the front line. Putin's firm stance underscores the profound geopolitical divisions and ongoing challenges to a ceasefire, despite recent dialogues between Putin and US President Donald Trump aimed at de-escalation, indicating a prolonged period of instability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes saw a 0.6% increase in July, exceeding analyst expectations, primarily attributed to favorable sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. This boost led to strong sales growth in clothing, footwear, and online retail sectors, with a notable rise in demand for household goods like air conditioners. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) released these figures after a two-week delay, admitting to past data errors and outlining improvement plans. Despite this positive monthly performance, overall sales for the three months to July declined, and potential future tax rises could dampen the retail sector's momentum.</p>

          <p>Kenya is in advanced discussions with the Export-Import Bank of China to transition its debt payments from US dollars to yuan, a strategic move aimed at alleviating pressure on its foreign reserves. This potential currency swap is anticipated to significantly reduce interest rates on loans for the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), potentially halving them from 6.37% in dollars to around 3% in yuan. Kenyan Treasury Minister John Mbadi characterized this as a 'win-win' scenario, emphasizing the substantial financial advantages for Kenya. This initiative highlights a growing global trend among nations exploring alternative currencies for international debt management.</p>

          <p>Bidders seeking to acquire a portion of Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at as much as $5 billion, according to informed sources. This potential deal could become one of the most valuable divestments by a global consumer company in China in recent years. The offers, which generally value Starbucks China at approximately 10 times its expected 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), come as the company faces sluggish growth and intense competition from local brands in the Chinese market. This strategic move aims to allow Starbucks to navigate these challenges and potentially restructure its presence in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a White House dinner with over two dozen prominent tech leaders, including Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai, to discuss business and artificial intelligence. Elon Musk was invited but did not attend, sending a representative instead, following a public spat with Trump earlier in the year. Trump praised the 'high-IQ group' and their role in a 'revolution in business and in genius.' Bill Gates discussed vaccine advancements, while Trump defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'different take' on vaccines. The event underscored Trump's cultivation of ties with tech CEOs and his administration's focus on AI development and domestic investment.</p>

          <h2>UK Political Headlines Focus on Angela Rayner's Ethics Report and Nadine Dorries' Defection</h2>

          <p>UK newspaper headlines are dominated by two major political stories: the anticipated ethics report concerning Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and the defection of Nadine Dorries from the Conservative Party to Reform UK. The Telegraph suggests Rayner 'has to go' following contradictions in her stamp duty explanation, with other papers calling it 'judgement day' and a 'crisis point.' Dorries' defection is seen as a 'seismic blow' to the Conservatives, potentially boosting Nigel Farage's Reform UK and signaling a trembling political landscape ahead of an election. The article also briefly mentions widespread tributes to the fashion designer Giorgio Armani.</p>

          <p>PBS is implementing significant job cuts, eliminating about 15% of its workforce, totaling over 100 positions, due to the complete elimination of federal funding for public broadcasting. This drastic measure comes after Republicans in Congress rescinded $1.1 billion in planned expenditures and the Trump administration canceled a major Education Department grant. PBS Chief Executive Paula Kerger stated the system faces a 21% revenue hit, forcing difficult choices across all facets of the organization, including cutting travel and merit pay. This funding cut also impacts NPR and its member stations, with some already facing layoffs and fears that many rural stations could ultimately shut down.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Donald Trump to a debate, suggesting they 'cut out the middle man' after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of debates with Mamdani. Trump had expressed strong opposition to Mamdani becoming mayor, reportedly exploring ways to encourage other candidates to drop out to create a two-person race. Mamdani, currently leading in the polls, criticized Trump's alleged cuts to SNAP benefits. The mayoral race is intensifying, with both Mamdani and Cuomo vying for public attention and attempting to shape the narrative, while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa refuse to withdraw.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump finalized a trade deal with Japan, implementing a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese goods, including autos, in exchange for significant Japanese investments in US projects and increased purchases of American agricultural and defense products. This agreement, reached after months of negotiations, also grants 'breakthrough openings' in various manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, and automobile sectors. The finalization comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces mounting political pressure and internal discontent within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, following poor election performance and calls for a leadership challenge. This article details the specific terms of the deal and its broader political implications.</p>
