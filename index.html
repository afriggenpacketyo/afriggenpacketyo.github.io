            <p>NASA astronaut Don Pettit, along with cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner, safely returned to Earth after a 220-day mission on the International Space Station. The crew landed in Kazakhstan, with Pettit experiencing some disorientation upon return to gravity, which he had anticipated. During their time on the ISS, they orbited the Earth 3,520 times, traveling over 93 million miles since their launch in September. The ISS is currently facing challenges related to air leaks and budget shortfalls, highlighting the increasing risks associated with maintaining the orbiting laboratory as it approaches its scheduled retirement in 2030.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully tested a non-nuclear hydrogen-based explosive device, creating a high-temperature fireball for an extended duration without using nuclear materials. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, utilizes a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. When activated by conventional explosives, the material releases hydrogen gas that ignites into a sustained inferno; this development has potential implications for both civilian and military applications, though the article focuses on the scientific achievement.</p>
