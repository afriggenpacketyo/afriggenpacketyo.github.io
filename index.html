          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) during a Taiwan visit, calling investment in the company "very smart" amidst ongoing discussions about the U.S. CHIPS Act. Huang revealed TSMC is developing six new products for Nvidia, including its next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin. This comes as the U.S. government explores equity stakes in chipmakers receiving CHIPS Act funding, while China has raised security concerns over Nvidia's H20 chips, impacting their production and sales. Nvidia is actively engaging with Beijing to resolve these issues, asserting the H20 is not a military product. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chocolate prices are set to continue rising due to the lagged impact of soaring cocoa prices, which hit record highs amidst adverse weather conditions and supply tightness in West Africa. Experts predict that the higher cost of doing business will still be passed on to consumers in the near term, as chocolatiers grapple with elevated raw material costs from late 2024. However, there's a possibility of slightly brighter news by next Easter, as industrial demand softens and supply improves from new plantings in regions like Ecuador and Brazil. Despite this, cocoa prices are expected to remain structurally higher for longer, influencing future chocolate costs for consumers globally.</p>

          <p>An attempt to rename Berlin's Mohrenstraße to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße, honoring a pioneering Black German Enlightenment philosopher, has been halted again by the Berlin Administrative Court. The renaming, intended to address the street's overtly racist connotations stemming from the 18th-century practice of "court moors," was approved in 2020 but faced a lawsuit from residents. Despite a higher administrative court upholding the renaming in July, an urgent application by a citizens' initiative means the change cannot proceed until their lawsuit is concluded. This prolongs a decades-long effort by civil society groups to decolonize public spaces and acknowledge Black history in Germany.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel lawsuit against The Guardian newspaper, which had published a series of allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. Clarke, known for "Doctor Who" and "Kidulthood," sued the publisher, claiming the accusations of being a "serial abuser of women" were false and part of an "unlawful conspiracy." During the High Court defamation trial, The Guardian defended its reporting as a "careful and thorough investigation conducted conscientiously." The dismissal of his case comes after the allegations led to the suspension of his BAFTA membership and his prestigious Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema honor.</p>

          <p>A U.N.-backed group of experts, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), has confirmed that famine is occurring in Gaza Governorate, with over half a million people at risk of dying from starvation and hundreds of thousands more facing catastrophic shortages. The report highlights this as an "entirely man-made" catastrophe, warning that at least 132,000 children under five could die from acute malnutrition in the coming months, a figure that has doubled since May. Despite warehouses filled with aid nearby, access is severely restricted, with international organizations accusing Israel of "weaponizing" aid, a claim Israel denies. The humanitarian situation continues to worsen amidst ongoing conflict and forced displacements.</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption reached a historic high in July, surpassing 1 trillion kilowatt-hours, a level comparable to the annual usage of all ASEAN nations combined. This significant 8.6% year-on-year surge was primarily driven by scorching heatwaves across the country, which pushed demand to unprecedented levels across various sectors. The primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, saw the fastest growth in electricity use. This record consumption occurred despite a slight slowdown in industrial output compared to June, underscoring the immense energy demands of China's rapidly growing economy and the impact of climate conditions.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation charge, a decision that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence under the country's strict lese majeste laws. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the evidence and witnesses too weak to support a conviction, noting the prosecution's interview account was incomplete and potentially politically biased. Thaksin, who has faced numerous politically motivated charges since his 2006 ouster, expressed relief, stating he can now work for the country. This verdict comes as his daughter, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, faces her own legal challenges, underscoring the ongoing political instability and judicial influence in Thai politics.</p>

The Fed is in a dilemma, balancing recent slowing job growth with a pickup in underlying inflation, and must decide whether to stimulate the economy or protect against tariff-induced inflation.

          <p>This article provides a timeline of the Trump administration's evolving stance on the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files, amidst persistent public pressure for transparency. Despite initial promises of more disclosures and Attorney General Pam Bondi's statement about a "client list," the Justice Department later stated it found no incriminating client list and concluded further disclosure was unwarranted due to sensitive victim information. President Trump has since criticized those fixated on Epstein, calling it a "hoax" perpetrated by Democrats and "stupid Republicans," and emphasizing the need for "credible" evidence. The administration has, however, filed motions to unseal some grand jury testimony and related exhibits, while also facing a House Oversight Committee subpoena for records.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have implemented new "Guidelines for Regulating Medical Science Self-Media Behaviour" to combat the widespread issue of false and misleading medical information disseminated online. These comprehensive rules specifically target health influencers and independently generated content on social media and other unofficial channels, imposing stricter requirements for healthcare practitioners and related personnel when posting medical science information. The guidelines also underscore the need for platforms to take greater responsibility to verify account credentials and ensure content authenticity. This initiative, alongside new guidelines for recognizing medical advertisements, aims to clearly distinguish genuine public health education from disguised commercial promotion, fostering a more reliable online health environment.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly scaled back his threat of high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, agreeing to limit them to 15% as part of a new US-EU trade deal. This decision, a substantial reduction from the previously threatened 250% and 100% rates, offers considerable relief to major European exporters like Ireland and Denmark. In return, the EU must pass legislation to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods, including agricultural products, to see the 27.5% tariff on European motor vehicle exports reduced to 15%. The deal aims to provide much-needed predictability and stability in the world's largest trading partnership. (not investment advice)</p>
