            <p>Archaeologists discovered a Teotihuacan altar in Tikal National Park, Guatemala, revealing interactions between the Mayan and Teotihuacan cultures. The altar, believed to have been used for sacrifices, contained the remains of three children, each no older than four years old. This discovery highlights Tikal's role as a cosmopolitan center where people from different cultures converged between 300 and 500 A.D. The altar, made of limestone and covered with anthropomorphic figures, is considered a unique find in Guatemala, demonstrating the complex religious practices of these ancient civilizations.</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods from numerous countries have taken effect, triggering widespread concerns about the potential harm to the global economy. These tariffs, ranging from 20% to 104% on Chinese products, are intended to boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but economists warn they could lead to higher prices for consumers and a possible recession. Stock markets have experienced significant volatility in response to the tariffs, as investors fear increased costs and reduced profits for companies. The UK and other countries are also bracing for economic impacts and considering retaliatory measures.</p>

            <p>Vice President JD Vance publicly criticized Senator Mitch McConnell's vote against confirming Elbridge Colby as undersecretary of defense for policy, labeling it an act of 'political pettiness.' McConnell argued that Colby's views represent a return to Obama-era geostrategy and would harm US alliances. Colby was eventually confirmed in a 54-45 vote, with McConnell being the only Republican senator to vote against him. Vance had previously voiced his support for Colby's nomination, highlighting the growing divide within the Republican party regarding foreign policy.</p>

            <p>California lawmakers are addressing the potential dangers of AI chatbots by introducing legislation requiring operators of companion chatbot platforms to implement safeguards for young users. The bill mandates regular reminders that virtual characters aren't human and protocols for addressing suicidal ideation or self-harm expressed by users. This initiative follows concerns raised by parents, like Megan Garcia, whose son took his own life after interacting with AI chatbots. The legislation aims to protect minors from potentially harmful interactions with AI companions, although tech industry groups have expressed concerns about the bill's impact on innovation and free speech.</p>

While some argue that larger cars offer greater safety, research suggests that they contribute to increased fatalities in collisions and rising pedestrian deaths. The author argues that many of these vehicles serve as emotional support vehicles (ESVs), catering to owners' insecurities rather than practical needs. However, the increasing costs of cars due to Trump's tariffs might lead to a shift back to smaller, more sensible vehicles.</p>

Even American expats living in Canada are siding with their neighbors, expressing surprise at the newfound patriotism.
