          <p>New York Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson was seen in an animated and seemingly frustrated discussion with head coach Aaron Glenn as the team headed to the locker room for halftime. The confrontation occurred during a game against the Denver Broncos in London, following a perplexing offensive drive that yielded minimal results. Wilson, the team's leading receiver and the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year, was targeted only twice in the first half for a single two-yard catch. The Jets' offense struggled significantly, gaining only 32 total yards as they sought their first win of the season amid widespread performance issues.</p>

          <p>The office of Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced that an illegal and forceful attempt to seize power is currently underway. This development comes as an influential army unit, CAPSAT, which was instrumental in Rajoelina's 2009 rise to power, claimed control of the military and joined widespread youth-led protests. The demonstrations, initially sparked by utility shortages, have grown into a larger movement against the government's handling of unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis. The situation remains tense, with protesters gathering in the capital's main square and reports of shoot-outs near a military camp.</p>

Witnesses reportedly fled to nearby businesses for shelter during the chaos. Among the injured, four were reported to be in critical condition at local hospitals. Authorities have described the event as a tragic and difficult incident, asking for patience as the investigation continues, while public figures like U.S. Rep.

          <p>A powerful nor'easter is making its way up the U.S. East Coast, prompting New Jersey to declare a state of emergency in anticipation of significant weather impacts. The storm is expected to bring coastal flooding, strong winds up to 60 mph, and as much as five inches of rain to parts of the state through Monday. The National Weather Service has also issued coastal flood warnings and wind advisories for New York City and Long Island.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has accused Democrats of engaging in "hostage-taking" over their demands in the ongoing government shutdown, which has entered its twelfth day. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Vance asserted that the administration will not negotiate with Democratic leaders who are insisting on an extension of health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government. While Republicans have held votes on a House-passed funding measure, Democrats demand broader negotiations involving congressional leaders and the White House. The impasse continues as the White House confirmed that layoffs of federal workers have begun, a situation Vance attributed to the "chaos" created by Democrats' actions.</p>

          <p>Human rights advocates and lawyers are expressing alarm over the increasing presence and aggressive tactics of U.S. Border Patrol agents in major cities far from the nation's borders. These agents, primarily trained for border security, are now being deployed for civil immigration enforcement in urban areas like Chicago and Los Angeles as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan. Critics argue that the agency's culture of combative enforcement is ill-suited for community interactions, leading to potential constitutional rights violations. This expansion is possible due to a statute allowing warrantless searches within 100 miles of any international boundary, a zone that includes most of the U.S. population.</p>

While technology companies are often blamed for releasing unproven products, the article argues that the ultimate responsibility lies with employers.

After a four-day trial and 17 months of incarceration, the jury acquitted Alison, with one juror noting the prosecution's case lacked a murder weapon and had significant holes in its theory.</p>

          <p>A feature explores why the United States has such a rich history of modern invention, tracing the spirit back to figures like Thomas Edison. Rather than a lone genius, Edison fostered a collaborative "invention factory" at Menlo Park, a model for systematic innovation. The article interviews entrepreneurs from the show "Shark Tank" and author Steven Johnson, who attribute America's success to a combination of factors. These include a pioneering spirit inherited from immigrants, a financial ecosystem with robust venture capital, government support for research, and a cultural acceptance of failure as a step toward success.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is causing significant financial distress for workers, as exemplified by the story of Stephanie Rogers, a microbiologist with the FDA. A single mother of two, Rogers moved in with her mother months ago in anticipation of financial instability and has had to withdraw from her retirement savings to cope with the loss of her paycheck. The current shutdown feels different and more stressful due to threats of mass firings and the potential denial of backpay. Her family's situation highlights the profound personal impact of the political stalemate on the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal employees.</p>

          <p>During a rare press conference in Delhi attended by female journalists, the Taliban's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, was questioned about his government's ban on education and work for Afghan women and girls. Muttaqi claimed that female education is not forbidden under Islamic law but has been "postponed" by order of the supreme leader. This event followed an earlier press conference from which women journalists were excluded, which Muttaqi dismissed as a "technical issue." Afghanistan remains the only country where the government has systematically stripped women of their basic rights, a key obstacle to the Taliban regime's international recognition.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece posits that the appointment of conservative provocateur Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is not a sudden shift but the culmination of a 50-year strategy to reshape American media. The article traces this effort back to the 1971 Powell Memo, which called for corporations to exert influence over news outlets to promote a pro-business agenda and counter critical journalism. It alleges that media executives, including at CBS, actively participated in this movement to shift coverage away from scrutinizing corporate power. The authors argue Weiss's ascent represents the success of this long-term plan to make news outlets champions, rather than adversaries, of power.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a warning to propaganda staff and other classified units to tighten controls on confidential information. An official article cited several instances where news media had leaked state secrets, blaming lax confidentiality reviews and a desire for publicity over security. The agency cautioned that public information released by government departments is heavily scrutinized by foreign entities and that weak controls could endanger national security. The directive underscores the government's ongoing efforts to control the flow of information and prevent sensitive details from reaching the public domain.</p>

          <p>The UK's education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has stated that the prime minister's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, had no role in the substance or evidence of the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. Conservatives had suggested Powell was responsible for the prosecution's failure to obtain necessary evidence, leading to the charges being dropped. The Director of Public Prosecutions had previously stated the trial collapsed because the government did not provide evidence defining China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. The situation has sparked a political dispute over the government's handling of the case and its policy toward China.</p>

The mayor emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers would be treated equally in government procurement processes. The policy aims to support foreign companies in participating in and building both upstream and downstream supply chains within the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the common question of whether it is possible to separate art from the artist, specifically concerning J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter universe. The author argues that it is acceptable to continue engaging with the series, despite Rowling's controversial views on transgender issues and problematic elements within the books themselves. The column suggests that the core positive message of the books—rejecting supremacy and discrimination—can still be valued. It recommends that fans critically interrogate the content in a community setting, transforming their engagement into a socially conscious act rather than simply trying to offset guilt through financial donations.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has asserted that the precedent set in 2011 should secure a second independence referendum if his Scottish National Party (SNP) wins a majority in the next Holyrood election. After the SNP's majority win in 2011, the UK government agreed to the 2014 referendum. Swinney argues this established a clear basis for a new vote, despite the current UK Labour government's opposition. The SNP conference recently backed a strategy to treat the next election as a de-facto poll on independence, a move Swinney believes puts the party in a strong position to negotiate.</p>

This intervention comes amid what experts describe as unprecedented threats to judicial independence in the U.S., where the administration has been accused of employing authoritarian tactics. Bukele's comments align with social media attacks on U.S. judges by administration officials and allies. Monitoring groups have documented a sharp increase in threats against federal and local judges, which they link directly to the rhetoric from senior political figures aiming to undermine the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Blaise Ingoglia, a Ron DeSantis appointee, is leading an initiative to audit Democratic-run cities and counties in Florida for what he calls "excessively wasteful" spending. However, the effort is facing criticism for being politically motivated and for using intimidating tactics, such as sending armed police to the home of a retiree who sent Ingoglia a non-threatening postcard. Officials in targeted areas like Broward County are pushing back, claiming Ingoglia's calculations of waste are based on inaccurate data and ignore unfunded mandates from the state. Critics suggest the audits are a political tool to attack DeSantis's opponents and build support for state-level tax reforms.</p>
