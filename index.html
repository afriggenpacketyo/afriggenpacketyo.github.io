          <p>Former President Joe Biden's announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has complicated the Democratic Party's efforts to reassess his legacy and the 2024 election loss. The New York Times article details how the news has shifted the focus from internal criticism to expressions of sympathy, though some, like former Representative Dean Phillips, suggest the timing was strategic. The article further discusses how the diagnosis has fueled speculation about whether Biden's health was concealed during his presidency, with some physicians questioning when he first learned of his condition. The situation underscores the challenges of aging politicians and the importance of transparency in leadership.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president and declares the DOGE officials who replaced him "illegitimately installed." The judge stated that the administration's actions to dissemble USIP, including terminating board members and dispersing its assets, were unlawful, as the agency is an independent think tank outside the executive branch. The article notes that the USIP is now able to resume its work in promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Atlantic reports that Donald Trump's tax bill is struggling to pass Congress due to internal Republican disagreements and stark fiscal realities. The article highlights how the bill, projected to add trillions to the deficit, relies on optimistic economic growth projections and faces opposition from fiscal hawks within the party. Moody's recent downgrade of the nation's credit rating further underscores concerns about increased federal spending without corresponding revenue. The article also points out the bill's structural contradictions, such as extending tax cuts without addressing spending cuts or revenue increases, leading to market instability.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations, covering fishing, trade, defense, and energy, marking the biggest reboot since Brexit in 2020. The BBC article details that a key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats access to British waters for another 12 years in exchange for easing some trade frictions. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a move forward, some Conservatives and Reform UK criticized it as a "surrender" to the EU. The agreement also includes a security pact and cooperation on various issues like youth mobility and energy networks.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage jumped back above 7% after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating due to concerns about government debt levels. The article explains that mortgage rates tend to track the 10-year Treasury bond, which is sensitive to economic conditions. While some analysts expect limited market impact due to the nation's well-known debt issues, elevated mortgage rates are likely to persist, making homeownership less affordable. The article also notes that only a fraction of listed homes are affordable for households with a $75,000 annual income.</p>

          <p>President Trump is publicly pressuring companies like Walmart and Mattel to absorb the costs of his tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers, as reported by The New York Times.

That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts. If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses.</p>
