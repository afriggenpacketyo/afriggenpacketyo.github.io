          <p>Weeks before Nicole Kidman filed for divorce from Keith Urban, she gave a Vogue interview where she reflected on life's unpredictability and implied a potential split. Kidman questioned how many times one must learn that life doesn't always go as planned. The Vogue piece was published by October 8, after Kidman had already filed for divorce from Urban, news of which broke on September 29. Kidman cited irreconcilable differences and marital difficulties in court documents, with the separation date listed as September 30; insiders claimed the split was inevitable and that they had been living separately. The actress made public appearances after the split and debuted a fresh hairstyle. Optimism around the future remains a personal matter for those involved.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached a deal for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an agreed-upon line, calling it the first phase of a peace deal. Two regional sources confirmed an agreement in principle, pending procedural details, with hostage release potentially starting on Monday. The deal requires Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed-upon line in Gaza, followed by Hamas releasing hostages within 72 hours. Hamas praised mediators and called on Trump to ensure Israel complies with the agreement, while Netanyahu said it was a big day for Israel. This agreement follows Trump's unveiling of a 20-point peace plan and indirect negotiations in Egypt. The plan is welcomed by all sides as a starting point.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's obsession with his legacy and obituaries is reportedly fueling his revenge crusade against political opponents. Trump has called for the arrest of the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor without providing evidence of any crime. Former FBI Director James Comey was arraigned on charges of making false statements to Congress. The administration is creatively using other levers of government to punish its foes, including stripping security clearances, triggering IRS audits, and pursuing expensive litigation. These actions reflect a shift from focusing on tariffs and global conflicts to prioritizing retaliation against perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon Press Association stated that negotiations with the Defense Department over proposed reporting restrictions have reached an impasse, while the Pentagon maintains it negotiated in good faith. The association is concerned that new rules requiring reporters to acknowledge they won't disclose unauthorized information could stifle a free press. The Pentagon dropped a requirement for reporters to agree with the policy but still asks for affirmation of understanding policies that could expose them to prosecution. The association fears credential revocation for reporters seeking unapproved information, even if unclassified, and the policy sends an intimidation message to those interacting with the press. The Pentagon defended its accommodating approach and the need for reasonable regulations, stating access is a privilege, not a right. The situation remains tense as news outlets face a deadline to sign the revised guidelines.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to the initial steps of a U.S.-backed peace framework in Gaza, but some of the most difficult points, such as the governance of Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas fighters, will still need to be negotiated down the line. The agreement focuses on the partial Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. This is not the first time the U.S. has brokered a multi-part agreement aimed at ending the conflict that includes the release of hostages in an initial phase. A previous three-phase agreement brokered at the beginning of the year fell apart after the release of more than 30 hostages.</p>

          <p>President Trump offered a 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for Hamas to release all Israeli hostages within 72 hours and for Israel to begin a phased military withdrawal from Gaza. The plan proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a technocratic committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states. If Hamas does not accept the offer, Netanyahu said Israel would finish the job itself. The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree, with Israeli forces withdrawing to an agreed-upon line and a full aid package being sent to Gaza. The plan's success hinges on Hamas's response and cooperation from international partners.</p>

Comey's lawyer said they would file motions to have the charges dismissed, alleging vindictive prosecution and challenging the appointment of the U.S. attorney who brought the charges.

          <p>The Pacific Palisades community is grappling with the revelation that the Jan. 7 fire was intentionally set and that it had been smoldering since Jan. 1. Authorities charged Uber driver Jonathan Rinderknecht with intentionally setting the fire, and residents are trying to come to terms with the news. Some residents feel the identification might bring some closure, while others believe it won't change the trauma. Recovery from the fires is slow but ongoing, with many still mired in reconstruction efforts, struggling to recover and rebuild due to financial constraints.</p>

          <p>Satellite images suggest that Russian soldiers may be occupying the childhood home of a Ukrainian journalist in the Russian-occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region. A well-used road leading to the house appeared in satellite images after the occupation began, indicating military activity. The village, Verkhnya Krynytsya, was occupied by Russia shortly after the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The area has become a dangerous location, exposed to frequent aerial attacks from the Ukrainians, with many locals fleeing the village. It seems that my old home has become a tiny cog in the wider machine of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump called for the jailing of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for failing to support federal agents. Trump continues to paint a dark and violent picture of both Chicago and Portland, Ore., where he is trying to send federal troops. Pritzker characterized Trump’s depiction of Chicago as “deranged” and untrue, and the legality of deployments to Portland and Chicago will face scrutiny in two federal courts. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has joined the fight against the president’s deployment efforts, and Trump has aimed to expand presidential power and use it to go after his critics.</p>

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner praised Maya Le Tissier's consistent performance but avoided commenting on whether she should start for England. Despite being a top defender in the Women's Super League, Le Tissier has had limited international exposure. Skinner emphasized her importance to Manchester United and her potential to become an England stalwart. Le Tissier secured a victory over Valerenga in their league phase opener. Injuries to key England players may provide Le Tissier with an opportunity to play in upcoming matches against Brazil and Australia.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. will renew the contract for studio heads Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy after a string of box office hits. The pair was on thin ice six months ago after underperforming films, but the studio's prospects changed with the release of several successful movies. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav credited Abdy and De Luca for the improved performance at the box office. The studio has surpassed $4 billion at the global box office, the first time it has done so since 2019.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch announced that the Conservative Party would take the UK out of the European Convention of Human Rights if they won the next election. This issue has come to the forefront of domestic politics, with strong opinions over whether or not to pull out of the treaty. The consequences are deeply complicated, and Badenoch acknowledged that leaving would not be a silver bullet for tackling immigration. The ECHR had been largely drafted by a British team and aimed to impose on post-fascist Europe a never-again package of legal rights. Disputes between UK courts and Strasbourg can be worked through.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to undergo a medical checkup at Walter Reed Medical Center, his second exam this year. The visit comes after Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency that has resulted in visible swelling in his lower legs. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will also take part in a planned meeting with troops at the facility and deliver remarks to them. Trump's most recent physical at Walter Reed was on April 11, and a report released after the exam said the president is in excellent health. The president's physician also addressed concern about bruising on the president’s hand.</p>

          <p>JP Morgan head Jamie Dimon warned of a higher risk of a serious fall in US stocks, which he said could come in the next six months to two years. Dimon also said that the US had become a less reliable partner on the world stage. He cautioned he was still a little worried about inflation in the US, but insisted he thought the Federal Reserve would remain independent. Dimon felt there were increased risks US stock markets were overheated, pointing to risk factors like the geopolitical environment, fiscal spending, and the remilitarization of the world.

          <p>Sana el-Azab, a former teacher from Gaza, has arrived in Durham, England, to study educational leadership and change after being evacuated to the UK. Sana was awarded a scholarship at Durham University, but weeks of uncertainty followed before she was allowed to come to the UK. Sana set up her own makeshift school in a roof-less building at her home in Deir al-Balah, teaching English and maths to displaced children. In all, 58 students from Gaza have now arrived to take up scholarships at more than 30 universities around the UK, but Sana says she is struggling to concentrate and can't eat or sleep properly.</p>
