          <p>AMD reported strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing expectations with 96 cents per share adjusted earnings and $7.44 billion in revenue. Despite these positive results, the company anticipates a $700 million hit to revenue in the current quarter due to U.S. export controls on AI chips to China. CEO Lisa Su highlighted that the company faces headwinds from dynamic macro and regulatory environments, including these export controls, but believes they are offset by a strong product portfolio. AMD's data center sales surged by 57%, driven by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, with its chips being used for AI training and deployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India conducted strikes on what it claims were nine terrorist sites within Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a militant attack that killed over two dozen civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian government described the actions as "focused, measured, and nonescalatory," while Pakistan asserted that the strikes "will not go unanswered." The strikes involved potential targets associated with militant groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. The United States has acknowledged the situation as a "shame" and hopes for a swift resolution, highlighting the escalating conflict's potential to ignite a broader war between the two nuclear powers.</p>

CEO Charles Liang noted that customers are delaying commitments to AI platforms due to anticipation of new GPUs, and that the company is not providing fiscal 2026 guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty.

Critics worry that the cuts could be based on partisan considerations rather than strategic analysis, potentially crippling the military. The Army restructuring plan involves fielding long-range missiles and drones, but also scrapping outdated equipment and formations, which could face resistance from lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Media mogul Barry Diller publicly addressed being gay for the first time in an excerpt from his forthcoming memoir, while also celebrating his marriage to Diane von Furstenberg. Diller writes about the quiet suffering he felt hiding his sexuality and a fear of exposure that stunted his personal life. He characterizes his relationship with von Furstenberg as one of "romantic love and deep respect," despite it causing "confusion and lots of speculation." Von Furstenberg said she did not see Diller’s announcement as a “coming out,” but rather as Diller simply telling the truth.</p>

Despite the tensions, the two leaders praised each other in a largely cordial meeting. Carney pressed Trump on lifting tariffs, and found him to be "willing to have that negotiation."</p>

          <p>President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures has sparked widespread criticism, with concerns raised about potential conflicts of interest and constitutional violations. His promotion of the $TRUMP meme coin and invitation to top coin holders for a dinner have been described as selling access to the White House. The Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, has drawn scrutiny for its foreign investments and potential benefits from Trump's official actions, raising questions about bribery and emoluments clauses in the Constitution. This has put passage of the cybercurrency industry’s key legislation pending before the Senate in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>Restaurants across the country are increasingly serving whole-leaf salads, opting for the dramatic appearance and textural integrity despite the inelegance of eating them. Chefs argue that whole leaves cradle breadcrumbs, seeds, herbs, and cheese more effectively, creating the perfect bite. While some diners appreciate the visual appeal and unique textures, others find it inconvenient to disassemble and eat these salads, questioning the practicality of cutting lettuce like a steak. The trend reflects a shift towards prioritizing aesthetics and textural experience in dining, even if it sacrifices some ease of consumption.</p>
