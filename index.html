        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves asserts that the UK's recent trade deals with the US, India, and the EU position it advantageously in global trade, potentially leading to upgraded economic growth forecasts. Reeves highlights that these agreements, particularly the comprehensive EU deal finalized after Brexit, demonstrate Britain's appeal for investment and business. The chancellor indicates that the government is pursuing further trade pacts with Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, while distancing itself from trade negotiations with China. Some opposition parties have criticized concessions made in these trade deals, but Reeves remains optimistic about their economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially subjecting them to deportation. This decision reverses a lower court's block on the administration's move to end the program, which allows individuals from countries facing natural disasters or armed conflicts to live and work legally in the U.S. Activists and attorneys representing the migrants have condemned the decision, while Homeland Security officials framed it as a victory for American safety. The move aligns with Trump's broader hardline stance on immigration, which has faced legal challenges throughout his presidency.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in New Orleans after ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish jail, raising concerns about the facility's long-standing issues with poor conditions and insufficient oversight. The inmates, facing charges ranging from murder to armed robbery, breached a cell wall and crossed Interstate 10 on foot, leaving behind a taunting message. The jailbreak has prompted increased scrutiny of the Orleans Parish Sheriffâ€™s Office, which has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 due to overcrowding and understaffing. Louisiana's Governor Jeff Landry has demanded answers and attributed the escape to broader failings within the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian man residing in Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, was arrested after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture, causing a collision with multiple vehicles.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, the lowest in two years, citing receding inflation concerns. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and reflects Australia's recent inflation rate of 2.4%, a four-year low. While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range, it also acknowledged the uncertain economic outlook, including potential downside risks from global trade tensions. Analysts predict a further dovish pivot from the RBA, forecasting a terminal rate of 3.1% in early 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
