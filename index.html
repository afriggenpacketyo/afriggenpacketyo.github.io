            <p>An Alabama woman, Towana Looney, who received a gene-edited pig kidney in an experimental transplant, had the organ removed after a record 130 days due to her body beginning to reject it. Despite the rejection, Looney expressed gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to research and said the experience provided valuable insights for future kidney disease solutions. Doctors decided removing the pig's kidney was safer than trying to save it, and Looney is now back on dialysis but reports feeling better for the break. The transplant was part of efforts to address the shortage of human organs for transplant, with over 100,000 people on the U.S. waiting list, mostly for kidneys.</p>

            <p>The LA Galaxy celebrated their 30th anniversary in the MLS with a 1-1 draw against the Houston Dynamo. The match, held at Dignity Health Sports Park, featured a pre-game ceremony honoring the team's history and past champions. Despite the festive atmosphere, the Galaxy struggled on the field, going down a goal early and having a player sent off. A second-half free-kick goal salvaged a point for the Galaxy, who are looking to improve their position in the Western Conference standings. The Galaxy paid tribute to Cobi Jones, who scored the team's first-ever goal in 1996.</p>

            <p>A study suggests the United States has a significant opportunity to become a key technology partner for Indonesia, despite the country's strong economic ties with China. The report emphasizes the need for a more strategic and ambitious approach from Washington to compete effectively with Beijing, which has already established itself as a major investor and tech partner in Indonesia. Indonesia's policy of strategic autonomy is increasingly challenged by deepening ties with China, particularly in sensitive technologies, potentially requiring a shift in its balancing act between the two superpowers.</p>

            <p>A former coworker of Rex Heuermann, the suspect in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, recounted an incident where he tracked her down on a cruise, stating, "I told you I could find you anywhere," which she now finds unsettling. Heuermann, an architect, has been charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello and is the prime suspect in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. The coworker also recalled Heuermann giving her a sweater from Iceland, which she now suspects may have been during a time when his wife was out of the country, providing him with an opportunity to commit the murders.</p>

Experts had warned that these tariffs would lead to increased consumer prices for electronics in the U.S. The decision is expected to benefit countries in Southeast Asia that rely on tech exports to the U.S. The move coincides with a visit to the region by Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

The country has the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults globally, and a Lancet study projects this number to increase significantly by 2050. Abdominal obesity is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, with a large percentage of Indian women and men already exhibiting signs of it. Lifestyle changes and evolutionary adaptations are contributing factors.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongfully deported from Maryland to El Salvador, is reported to be "alive and secure" in a Terrorism Confinement Center, according to a U.S. State Department official. The update follows a Supreme Court ruling that the Trump administration must assist in his return to the U.S., after an immigration judge had granted him protection from deportation in 2019 due to potential persecution. The U.S. government acknowledges an "administrative error" led to his deportation, while also claiming he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies. President Trump is scheduled to meet with El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele.</p>
