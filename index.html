          <p>In a dramatic Major League Soccer match, the LA Galaxy managed a 3-3 draw against their rivals, LAFC, thanks to a goal from defender Maya Yoshida in the 97th minute. LAFC had established a strong lead with two goals from Denis Bouanga, but the Galaxy mounted a comeback throughout the game. The intense rivalry match, known as "El Tráfico," also saw a red card issued to LAFC's Eddie Segura in stoppage time. This result was a significant morale boost for the struggling Galaxy, while LAFC missed an opportunity to secure a win.</p>

          <p>In Kerr County, Texas, officials announced that only three people remain missing following the devastating July 4th flash floods, a significant decrease from nearly 100 previously unaccounted for. The floods claimed at least 135 lives across Texas, with the majority of fatalities occurring along the Guadalupe River. The disaster has prompted scrutiny of local authorities regarding the adequacy of warnings issued to residents and tourists in the flood-prone Hill Country region. The rapid and severe nature of the flooding caught many off guard in an area that lacked a comprehensive warning system.</p>

          <p>Pop star Charli XCX has married George Daniel, the drummer for the band The 1975, in what appeared to be an intimate ceremony at Hackney Town Hall in London. Speculation began after a passer-by spotted the couple, with the singer later confirming the news on her social media accounts. Charli XCX, whose album "Brat" was a major success last year, and Daniel have been in a public relationship for several years and got engaged in 2023. The two have also collaborated professionally on multiple music projects, including her recent album.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Milwaukee Brewers 8-7, marking their ninth loss in their last eleven games despite an improved offensive showing. The Dodgers scored seven runs on ten hits, including back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, but were unable to overcome the Brewers' lead. Key moments of missed opportunity, such as failing to score with a runner on third and no outs in the third inning, highlighted the team's ongoing struggles with timely hitting. The pitching staff also had a difficult night, contributing to the frustrating defeat for the team.</p>

          <p>Intense sectarian violence between Druze and Bedouin communities in southern Syria has persisted, resulting in over 900 reported deaths in the past week. Despite an announced ceasefire, fighting continued in Suweida province, with reports of Druze fighters pushing Bedouin gunmen out of the main city. The conflict has drawn international attention, with the U.S. calling for an end to the violence and Israel intervening with strikes against Syrian government forces, who were accused of attacking the Druze. The clashes erupted following the abduction of a Druze merchant, escalating long-running tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are disproportionately affecting small rural radio stations that provide essential local news and information.

These stations serve as a vital link in communities with limited internet and cell service, providing everything from emergency alerts to local obituaries.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the persistent failure to achieve peace in major global conflicts like those in Gaza, Ukraine, and Syria stems from more than just political deadlock. The author suggests a deeper issue: a collapse of a shared "permanent moral order" and the rise of moral relativism, where universal ethical standards are fractured. This environment allows atrocities to continue, as different groups justify actions that others find indefensible. The piece posits that without a return to agreed-upon universal principles, peaceful conflict resolution remains highly problematic, leaving only coercion and manipulation as tools.</p>
