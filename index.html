          <p>Federal authorities are investigating the use of a generative AI chat program by two men suspected of bombing a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, last month. Guy Edward Bartkus, the primary suspect, allegedly used the AI to research explosives using ammonium nitrate and fuel. This marks the second case this year where law enforcement has pointed to AI assisting in a bombing or attempted bombing, with a similar incident involving a soldier and a Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas. Tech companies are facing scrutiny for taking shortcuts in safety testing of AI models, leading to concerns about misuse and the spread of false information. The incident has sparked debate around the regulation and ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI technologies. Optimism in the wake of AI safety measures is tempered by the recognition of the potential risks associated with its misuse. </p>

          <p>Japan's real wages experienced a decrease of 1.8% in April, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline, according to recent reports. This news highlights ongoing economic challenges in Japan, as real wages reflect the purchasing power of workers after accounting for inflation. The continued decline may impact consumer spending and overall economic growth in the country. The report underscores the need for policymakers to address factors contributing to wage stagnation and inflationary pressures in the Japanese economy. The economic impact of the declining wages may have far reaching consequences, and so stability remains a key concern.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" and urging Americans to pressure lawmakers to reject it. Musk argues the bill will increase the national debt and burden citizens with unsustainable debt. The White House has defended the bill, asserting it will improve the fiscal trajectory and stimulate economic growth, while Trump refers to the bill as "big, beautiful bill". Musk's comments reflect wider tensions within the Republican Party over the bill, which has faced opposition from various factions and could add significantly to the budget deficit.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to discontinue the Transportation Security Administration's "Quiet Skies" program, which monitors travelers deemed to pose an elevated risk to aviation security. The program, initiated in 2010, utilizes analysts and air marshals to track individuals in airports and during flights based on various data points, including outstanding warrants and suspicious travel patterns. The program has faced criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes and has ensnared high-profile individuals. The decision to end the program comes after debates about its effectiveness and concerns over potential privacy violations. There is a degree of optimism as the government is considering to end the surveillance program.</p>

Recent graduates are facing challenges in finding employment, with unemployment rates higher than the national average. While wages in traditionally low-wage industries have grown, earnings for low-wage jobs without a college degree tend to stagnate over time. Despite the college wage premium remaining high, the gap between college and high school graduates' earnings has remained fairly consistent since 2010, raising questions about the long-term return on investment for all students.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is continuing his attacks on President Trump's signature bill, urging his followers on X to contact members of Congress and "KILL the BILL." He has posted numerous criticisms of the bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and arguing it will bankrupt America. Speaker Mike Johnson defended the bill, stating that Musk is "flat wrong" and that he tried to call the tech billionaire to discuss the matter. The posts come amid reports of a widening rift between Musk and the Trump administration over various issues, including electric vehicle tax credits and artificial intelligence deals.</p>

Anderson to head U.S. Africa Command. Cooper, who led naval forces for CENTCOM, played a key role in the U.S. bombing campaign against Houthi militants in Yemen and pushed for AI and drone deployment. The nominations come as Trump aims to restore stability in the Middle East, though challenges persist with the war in Gaza and Iranian nuclear deal speculations. Cooper helped to oversee strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen, a 16-month military campaign Trump abandoned this spring after the operation showed only a modest impact on the Iran-backed group's ability to regroup.</p>
