          <p>Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff discussed their unconventional approach to brokering a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, leading to a ceasefire and hostage exchange. They emphasized building trust through direct relationships and a "pragmatic realism" philosophy, navigating challenges like an Israeli missile strike in Qatar. The 20-point plan included hostage returns and phased Israeli withdrawal, despite Hamas's previous actions, which included sexual assault and murder. They addressed ethical concerns about their business ties, asserting their actions served American interests. The article highlights their confidence in the deal's success despite its fragility.</p>

          <p>Amy Sherald, renowned for her portraits of Black Americans, discusses her artistic philosophy, including her distinctive use of grayscale for skin tones to emphasize humanity over race. Her journey from struggling artist gained prominence after painting Michelle Obama's official portrait. This article highlights Sherald's decision to cancel a Smithsonian exhibition due to concerns about potential censorship of her "Trans Forming Liberty" painting by museum officials. Her work, which often features subjects staring directly at the viewer, is described as patriotic and a reimagining of American Realism to include everyone.</p>

          <p>Florida city council member Chandler Langevin faced widespread backlash and formal censure for posting derogatory social media messages targeting Indian people in the U.S. Langevin claimed Indians come to America to "drain our pockets" and called for mass deportations. National Indian American organizations, members of Congress, and local residents condemned his remarks as bigoted and dangerous, demanding his resignation. The Palm Bay city council voted 3-2 to formally censure him, with the mayor emphasizing the nation's foundation on immigrants and inclusivity, reflecting a stand against hate speech.</p>

          <p>The Israeli Premier League derby between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv was canceled due to "public disorder and violent riots" before kick-off. Police reported dozens of smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices, resulting in 12 civilian and three officer injuries, with nine arrests and 16 detentions. This unrest follows a UK decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from an upcoming Europa League match due to safety concerns, a ban the UK government is actively working to overturn. Hapoel Tel Aviv criticized the police, accusing them of preparing for "war, not a sporting event," highlighting the severe nature of the confrontation.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming Five-Year Plan for 2026-2030 continues a tradition of strategic planning that has profoundly reshaped the global economy. This article highlights three pivotal plans: "Reform and Opening Up" (1981-84) which initiated market reforms and led to the "China shock" of outsourced manufacturing; "Strategic Emerging Industries" (2011-15) which focused on green technology, giving China dominance in EVs and rare earths; and "High Quality Development" (2021-25) aiming for technological self-reliance. These plans demonstrate China's long-term vision and its significant impact on international trade, technology, and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Louvre Museum in Paris was the target of a brazen heist, where several individuals disguised as construction workers stole at least nine pieces of jewelry, including crowns and necklaces from the Napoleon collection, valued as "inestimable."

French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to recover the items, which include pieces from Queen Marie-Amelie and Empress Eugenie.

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational "V-level" courses for 16-year-olds, replacing existing Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications to simplify the post-16 education landscape. This initiative aims to increase vocational training, aligning with a target for two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical qualifications. Additionally, an alternative qualification will be offered to reduce the number of students resitting maths and English GCSEs, a policy that has proven controversial due to low pass rates.
