          <p>Nearly ten months after a Texas family's boat capsized off the coast of Homer, Alaska, search efforts have located human remains at the bottom of the bay, bringing closure to the tragic event. The U.S. Coast Guard had previously suspended their search without any sightings, but three private companies offered their assistance, leading to the discovery of the missing boat with potential human remains onboard. Divers have since recovered three sets of remains from the sunken vessel, which have been transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for identification and autopsy. The family, David and Mary Maynard, along with their two sons, were deeply missed by their community, who remember their laughter and family-oriented connection.</p>

          <p>Tank parts maker Renk is looking to hire workers from the struggling auto sector as it scales up production amid rising geopolitical tensions and military spending. Germany's historic fiscal package enabled a steep increase in defense spending, and Renk's stock has risen over 300% this year. The company is collaborating with the automotive industry, which faces difficulties due to a sluggish economy and increased competition. The move is seen as an opportunity to address overcapacity in the auto industry while bolstering the defense sector, potentially creating jobs and upgrading Germany as a production location.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that an emergency law does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but if unsuccessful, businesses who have paid tariffs will receive refunds with interest. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway.</p>

          <p>This article examines the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind their decision to serve in an army whose primary occupation is described as apartheid. The author highlights the story of Edan Alexander, an American Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas, and notes that thousands of Americans serve in Israeli ranks. The article explores the social apparatus through which young Americans are radicalized, pointing to Zionist summer camps and a sense of brainwashing. The author contrasts this with the attention given to the radicalization of Muslims and calls for greater scrutiny of the radicalization of young Zionists.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by increased demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota stated it would not pass on the tariff costs to consumers, analysts believe the company will face pressure to do so if the higher tariffs remain long-term. The automaker expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year through March due to the tariff measures and a stronger yen (not investment advice).</p>

Japan has requested the removal of higher tariffs on key automotive components and steel, but the U.S. has resisted complete removal.

          <p>A US court has undermined President Trump's core economic policy by ruling his tariffs unlawful, potentially electrifying the schism between the administration and the judiciary. The court found that Trump's executive orders imposing tariffs were invalid, stating that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not delegate unbounded tariff authority to the president. This ruling also applies to tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada, designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States. The president's lawyers are appealing, but if the ruling stands, it profoundly undermines Trump's strategy of using tariffs as a negotiating tactic and revenue generator.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields," and revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. The move is likely to cause anxiety across university campuses and could lead to retaliation from China. The lack of detail on the scope of the directive will fuel worries among the roughly 275,000 Chinese students in the US, as well as professors and university administrators who depend on their research skills and financial support.

The proposal, initially floated by a former foreign secretary, has gained momentum after Britain joined France and Canada in condemning Israel's expansion of military operations in Gaza. However, the recent shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some British officials to question the timing of such measures.

Despite legal guarantees and pressure from civil society, segregation persists, with new reforms sometimes reinforcing the very segregation they claim to address.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's approach to conflict, using the situation with Harvard University as an example. The author argues that Trump views conflict as a zero-sum game and believes that if he goes after someone, it is their fault, not his. Trump's actions against Harvard, including the suffocation of federal funding, are framed as a response to the university's resistance. The author suggests that Trump seeks to crush opponents to send a message that no dissent will be tolerated, citing examples such as executive orders targeting law firms and calls for investigations into former government officials.</p>

Recipients include Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Gangster Disciples, and Michael G. Grimm, a former New York representative convicted of tax evasion. The clemency actions reflect Trump’s efforts to redefine the presidential act of forgiveness, often rewarding supporters and incentivizing loyalty rather than following the Justice Department's vetting process.

The quarter-percentage rate cut came as the country continued to grapple with heightened political uncertainty following the botched attempt by former leader Yoon Suk Yeol to impose martial law in December.

A spokesperson for Reform dismissed the prime minister's comments as a "desperate attack" from a party "behind in the polls".
