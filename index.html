          <p>OpenAI's newly launched GPT-5 model, promoted as its smartest and fastest AI yet, has drawn mixed reviews from experts in China. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the system as a "PhD-level expert in anything," some Chinese analysts characterized it as an incremental improvement rather than a revolutionary breakthrough. The reaction highlights the heightened competition and high expectations within the global AI landscape, where Chinese companies are also rapidly developing their own advanced models.</p>

          <p>Protests have emerged in UK towns like Epping over the government's policy of housing asylum seekers in local hotels, sparking a tense debate. These demonstrations, fueled by local safety fears after a resident was charged with sexual assault, bring together concerned locals and far-right activists. While some residents express anger over a perceived lack of transparency and security, asylum seekers describe living in a difficult and uncertain state, caught between public hostility and a slow-moving immigration system.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a significant infrastructure project designed to create a strategic 2,000km (1,240-mile) artery linking its northwestern and southwestern regions. The route will connect Hotan with the existing line at Shigatse, traversing a challenging high-altitude environment. This railway is a key component of China's broader ambition to establish a comprehensive 5,000km plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by the year 2035.</p>

          <p>Travelers can face significant extra charges for using their phones abroad, but several strategies can mitigate these costs. Options include switching to a carrier with inclusive international roaming, such as certain T-Mobile plans, or purchasing a local or international eSIM for cheaper data access. Another effective method is to rely heavily on Wi-Fi, which can be optimized by downloading offline maps and other necessary content before leaving home, ensuring connectivity without incurring high roaming fees.</p>

          <p>A critical debate is unfolding over how to sustainably feed a growing global population, focusing on the trade-offs between land use, environmental impact, and agricultural productivity. New analyses argue that intensive farming, including controversial factory farms, may be a necessary evil to produce more food on less land and prevent the destruction of vital ecosystems like rainforests. This utilitarian approach challenges pastoral ideals of local or organic farming, sparking a difficult conversation about the future of food, animal welfare, and planetary health.</p>

Due to its solid form and complex carbohydrates, oatmeal digests more slowly, which helps maintain fullness for a longer period. While both can be nutritious choices, experts recommend enhancing either meal with protein and fiber, such as adding nuts to oatmeal or Greek yogurt to a smoothie, to maximize their energy-boosting benefits.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has officially approved the revival of a long-stalled project to build a bridge across the Strait of Messina, connecting Sicily to the mainland. The project, estimated to cost €13.5 billion, aims to be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge and is touted as a major economic stimulus for southern Italy. Despite government backing, it faces significant hurdles, including its location in a seismically active zone, environmental concerns, and strong opposition from local groups.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any peace deal that would require ceding territory to Russia. His statement comes after President Trump announced a summit with Vladimir Putin and suggested a land swap could be part of a solution to end the war. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukrainians will not gift their land to an occupier and that any decisions made without his country's participation are illegitimate and destined to fail, reinforcing his commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has firmly stated that it will not permit U.S. military operations on its territory, following reports that President Trump had directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels.

The stance reaffirms Mexico's commitment to its national sovereignty, even as the U.S. designates Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>India's Air Force Chief has publicly claimed for the first time that Indian forces shot down six Pakistani military aircraft, including five fighter jets, during border clashes in May. The chief cited electronic tracking data as confirmation and stated that most were downed by India's S-400 surface-to-air missile system. Pakistan did not immediately comment on the new claim but has previously denied losing any aircraft in the engagement, while asserting it had downed six Indian planes, highlighting the conflicting narratives between the nuclear-armed rivals.</p>

A veteran of four spaceflights, he was the first person to travel to the Moon twice but never had the chance to land on it. NASA and his family remembered him as a national hero whose unshakeable optimism and steady leadership turned a near-certain tragedy into one of the most celebrated triumphs in the history of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has ended his high-profile attempt to switch to the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to his original sport. His decision was influenced by a combination of factors, including a back injury, a coaching change at the Jaguars, and growing opportunities back in the world of rugby. While he showed promise, experts suggest the immense athletic and technical leap required to excel in the NFL proved formidable, leading him to return to the sport where he is already an established star.</p>
