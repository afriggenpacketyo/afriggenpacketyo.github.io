          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on his social media platform, X. Musk argues the bill will significantly increase the federal budget deficit, burdening American citizens with unsustainable debt. The White House dismissed Musk's criticism, while some Republican lawmakers, like Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Mike Lee, sided with Musk's concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit. Musk's critique comes after his term as a temporary "special government employee" expired, during which he led the Trump administration's efforts to cut government spending.

          <p>The wife and children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, Molotov cocktail attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, are now in ICE custody. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that authorities are investigating whether Soliman's family had prior knowledge or provided support for the attack. Soliman, who was in the U.S. on an expired tourist visa, allegedly planned the attack for a year and stated his desire to kill all Zionist people. Twelve people were injured in the attack, and Soliman faces federal hate crime and state charges. Optimism surrounding this event is low, given the violent nature of the attack and the subsequent legal and immigration ramifications. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research presented at NUTRITION 2025 suggests that the MIND diet, a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, may significantly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The diet emphasizes "brain-healthy foods" such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, and olive oil, while limiting pastries, refined sugar, red meat, and fried foods. The study, analyzing data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults, found that those who followed the MIND diet had an overall 9% reduced risk of dementia, with some groups showing a 13% lower risk, suggesting it's never too late to adopt a healthy diet. The findings indicate that dietary patterns play a crucial role in preventing cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming several naval ships named after civil rights leaders, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Internal documents suggest the move aligns with the Trump administration's priority of "reestablishing the warrior culture" within the military. The potential name changes have drawn criticism, with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi calling it a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality. The decision follows a directive to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months, raising concerns about inclusivity within the armed forces.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after serving 28 years in prison for a wrongful conviction stemming from the actions of disgraced Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was initially arrested after being shot, but he was then framed for an unrelated murder when he refused to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect. McDowell is the 51st person to be exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, who has a history of coercing false confessions. After years of legal battles, McDowell's murder and carjacking convictions were overturned, allowing him to walk free.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks have reportedly fired head coach Tom Thibodeau just days after their defeat in the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers. Thibodeau, who had been the Knicks' coach since 2020, led the team to the postseason in four of his five seasons, including their first conference finals appearance since 2000. The decision, made by team president Leon Rose with approval from owner Jim Dolan, is considered surprising by many, as Thibodeau had been credited with turning the franchise around after years of struggles. Despite the recent success, the team opted to move in a different direction.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative and EU skeptic, has been elected as the new Polish president, raising questions about the future of EU-Poland relations. Nawrocki's election has prompted reactions across Europe, with congratulations from right-wing leaders and calls for continued cooperation from others. As president, Nawrocki has limited direct influence on Poland's EU policy, which is primarily determined by the government, but he could potentially obstruct the implementation of EU policy in national legislation. The EU Parliament is divided on the implications of Nawrocki's election, with some hoping for constructive cooperation and others fearing continued political deadlock.</p>

          <p>The White House addressed concerns after acting Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director David Richardson reportedly made light of the start of hurricane season. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed concerns, stating that FEMA is taking hurricane season "seriously" despite the alleged jokes. This comes after an internal review indicated FEMA is "not ready" for the 2025 hurricane season. The White House maintains that the United States is well-prepared to handle disasters, while critics argue that the Trump administration is relying on the previous administration's plan due to employee departures and lack of funding.</p>

          <p>California will appeal a judge's decision to dismiss its challenge to Donald Trump's tariffs, arguing that the case should have been filed in a specialized trade court in New York. The ruling did not address the merits of California's lawsuit, which claims Trump lacked the authority to impose the tariffs. Three separate U.S. appeals courts may now simultaneously consider the legality of Trump's tariffs on trading partners. California argues that any federal court can hear the case because it raises constitutional objections to Trump's use of tariff powers.</p>
