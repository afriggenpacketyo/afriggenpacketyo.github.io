          <p>A U.S. judge criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man with legal protection from deportation, to a high-security prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis demanded Garcia's return, citing a "grievous error" and a violation of U.S. law, but the Justice Department appealed, arguing they lack the authority to extract him from a foreign jail. Garcia's family and lawyer deny any gang ties, while Attorney General Pam Bondi maintains Garcia's MS-13 membership without providing evidence. The case has also led to the removal of a Justice Department lawyer who didn't sufficiently argue the government's position.</p>

This downturn prompted significant long liquidations as traders who had bet on Bitcoin's price increase were forced to sell assets to cover losses.

          <p>The UK government is easing regulations for car manufacturers ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, aiming to protect jobs amid new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the relaxed rules to provide flexibility for firms transitioning to all-electric production. The changes include allowing smaller firms to continue producing petrol cars beyond 2030 and extending the market presence of some hybrid vehicles until 2035. These measures are intended to support the British car industry amidst global trade shifts and concerns about the pace of electric vehicle adoption.</p>

          <p>California has an opportunity to reduce emissions and improve climate resilience by investing in climate-smart agricultural practices. A $10 billion climate bond approved in November 2024 offers a chance to fund programs that help farmers adopt environmentally friendly methods. These programs can save farmers money and reduce pollution, but they are currently underfunded. The author advocates for allocating 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to these programs to support farmers in leading climate action.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open despite severe staffing shortages, raising concerns among conservation groups. The order mandates that any park closures or reduced hours require approval from the National Park Service director and assistant secretary. Critics argue that this move sidelines the expertise of park staff and creates unnecessary bureaucracy during peak visitation season. The order follows cuts to National Park Service staff, which could impact visitor services and park maintenance.</p>

          <p>U.S. investors are bracing for another volatile week of trading following last week's selloff triggered by the Trump administration's tariff announcement. The S&P 500 experienced its worst week since 2020, falling significantly from its all-time high. While some analysts anticipate a potential rebound, concerns remain about the sustainability of any rally due to ongoing trade tensions and the start of the first-quarter earnings season.

The storms have also disrupted travel, with numerous flight cancellations and delays. The impact of these storms is worsened by staffing shortages at National Weather Service forecast offices.</p>

          <p>Reports of serious childcare incidents in English nurseries have increased significantly, with nearly 20,000 incidents reported in the last five years. The latest figures show a 40% rise compared to five years ago, which Ofsted attributes partly to increased reporting efforts. These incidents range from injuries to deaths. Parents of a baby who died in a nursery are calling for stronger safeguarding measures, while experts highlight concerns about low standards of care and frequent short-staffing.</p>
