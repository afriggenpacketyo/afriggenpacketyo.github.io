          <p>Defense industry leaders believe technology is now sufficient to build a space-based missile defense system for the U.S., similar to Israel's Iron Dome.  The proposed 'Golden Dome' would involve a layered system of radars, interceptors, and lasers, but faces significant organizational and technological challenges, potentially starting with major cities before expanding nationwide.  Deployment could begin as early as 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IHRA definition of antisemitism is being used to restrict free speech and shape civil rights protections in the U.S., often conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism. This is viewed by some as a tool for political control, potentially endangering Jews and serving a larger Christian nationalist agenda.  Critics argue it silences dissent and prevents honest discussion of Israeli policies.</p>
