          <h2>Experts Question Veracity of Trump's MS-13 Tattoo Claims Regarding Deported Man</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump shared an image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos, alleging MS-13 membership, but experts cast doubt on this claim. The image shared by Trump appeared to have digitally added labels interpreting the tattoos as gang symbols, which some critics viewed as misleading. Experts acknowledged the tattoos could have gang-related symbolism, but they emphasized that tattoos alone are not reliable indicators of gang membership. Abrego Garcia, who has no criminal record, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, and the Trump administration cited the tattoos as evidence of gang affiliation, despite denials from Abrego Garcia's family and doubts from gang experts.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the installation of a makeup studio next to the Pentagon press briefing room, costing several thousand dollars, for television appearances. The suggestion for the upgrade came from Tami Radabaugh, a former Fox News producer, and was approved by other officials. Hegseth is reportedly doing his own makeup and has blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for revealing sensitive military strike details he shared in a Signal group chat.

          <p>Scammers are increasingly using artificial intelligence to create fake job applications, including generating resumes, headshots, and LinkedIn profiles, to apply for remote positions. These fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware once hired, and one cybersecurity firm has already encountered two AI-generated job seekers. Experts estimate that one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028. Companies are advised to scrutinize LinkedIn profiles, ask cultural questions, and conduct in-person interviews to verify the authenticity of candidates.</p>

The airline expects unit revenue to be flat to down as much as 6% and anticipates lower adjusted earnings per share. Alaska is not updating its full-year guidance, citing "economic uncertainty and volatility," but expects to remain profitable. While demand remains strong, customers are booking trips at lower fares than anticipated.</p>

Shildt emphasized the importance of player safety and the potential benefits of creating a lane for each player.
