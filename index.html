          <p>Police in Texas have identified an overseas man as the source of death threats directed at Houston Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. and his family following a poor start against the Cincinnati Reds. The man, who was betting on the Astros, admitted to sending the threats on social media while inebriated, expressing frustration over lost money and apologizing to the McCullers family. The Astros hired 24-hour security for McCullers and his family after he reported the online threats to the team, and McCullers expressed the difficulty of explaining the situation to his young daughter.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025, with a year-on-year increase of 1.3%, unchanged from the previous quarter and below estimates. Quarter-on-quarter growth was 0.2%, also falling short of expectations, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics attributing the soft growth to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and exports. Extreme weather events further reduced domestic final demand and exports, particularly impacting mining, tourism, and shipping, and the Reserve Bank of Australia expects domestic GDP growth to pick up in 2025, driven by a recovery in consumption and continued strength in public demand.

          <p>Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant accused of writing letters threatening to assassinate US President Donald Trump, was framed, according to investigators. Prosecutors claim the letters were written by Demetric Deshawn Scott, who is set to face trial for allegedly assaulting and robbing Mr Morales-Reyes. Scott admitted to writing the letters to prevent Mr Morales-Reyes from testifying in the robbery case, and Mr Morales-Reyes's handwriting is completely different from the writing on the letters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that used a federal law to require hospitals to stabilize patients in need of emergency care, including by providing an abortion. The Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance that, under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, doctors must perform abortions in emergency departments if it serves as a "stabilizing medical treatment" for an emergency medical condition, and HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded the guidance, saying they "do not reflect the policy of this Administration."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency has been reducing and reconsidering regulations designed to fight pollution, potentially impacting communities like Houston, Texas. A study found that pollution from a local power plant contributes to premature deaths annually, and the administration granted exemptions to plants from complying with federal regulations intended to lower mercury emissions. The administration argues that Biden-era regulations risk coal-fired plants shutting down, while critics argue that renewable energy sources are more reliable and result in less pollution.</p>

The bill includes the most substantial rollback of the ACA since 2017, but Republicans say the bill would merely reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" in Medicaid and other government health programs. The bill would leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034, according to the CBO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A controversy has emerged in mountaineering after four British climbers summited Everest shortly after arriving in Nepal, using xenon gas to accelerate acclimatization. Organized by Lukas Furtenbach, the expedition raised ethical questions about shortcuts to the summit, and critics argue it diminishes the Sherpa guides' work. This incident mirrors historical debates about using oxygen during the first Everest ascent and challenges the traditional values of mountaineering, prompting discussions about fairness and innovation in sports.</p>
