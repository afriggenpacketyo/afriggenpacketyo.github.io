          <p>Approximately 60 weight-loss drugs are currently under trial in China, positioning the country to compete with popular medications like Ozempic in a market valued at US$150 billion. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, which is years ahead of its expiration in other global markets. This early expiration is expected to pave the way for numerous cheaper, generic alternatives from Chinese manufacturers. Analysts predict this influx of competition will significantly drive down prices, making these treatments for diabetes and obesity more affordable and accessible for a wider population.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a US federal court. Known as "El Raton," Guzman Lopez admitted to his role in leading the Sinaloa Cartel alongside his brothers following their father's extradition and conviction. His plea agreement includes charges of coordinating the trafficking of fentanyl, cocaine, and other substances into the US, as well as money laundering. In exchange for his cooperation with prosecutors, he is expected to receive a reduced sentence, marking a significant development for US authorities targeting cartel leadership.</p>

          <p>BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff has announced his decision to withdraw from the university and its football program, initiating his transfer process. This move comes shortly after a sexual assault lawsuit filed against him was dismissed. In his defense against the lawsuit, Retzlaff had acknowledged a consensual sexual relationship, which reportedly led to a potential suspension for violating the university's honor code. With one year of eligibility remaining, Retzlaff, who threw for nearly 3,000 yards last season, is now expected to enroll and play at another school as a graduate student, ending a tumultuous period at BYU.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting immigration stops based on factors such as race, language, or location, ruling they likely violate the 4th Amendment. The order came in response to a lawsuit by immigrant rights groups alleging that federal agents were unlawfully targeting brown-skinned individuals in places like Home Depot parking lots and carwashes without reasonable suspicion. The judge found substantial evidence supporting these claims, which have reportedly terrorized communities and disrupted the local economy. This ruling represents a significant, albeit temporary, legal check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>A decade after its initial release, Lord Huron's song "The Night We Met" has become an unexpected global sensation, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify. The wistful indie folk ballad, which was not a hit in 2015, gained a new life after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017. Its popularity has since snowballed, largely fueled by its widespread use in videos on TikTok, where it has been embraced for its emotionally resonant lyrics. The song's enduring and growing appeal illustrates the power of streaming and social media to resurrect older tracks and turn them into modern standards.</p>

          <p>Numerous independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been left devastated after the popular plush toy brand Jellycat suddenly terminated their supply agreements. The company informed around 100 small retailers via a generic email that it would no longer fulfill their orders as part of a new "brand elevation strategy," with the decision being final. Shop owners, who had supported the brand for years and relied on it for a significant portion of their income, expressed feelings of shock and betrayal. The move has sparked a backlash from customers, who criticize Jellycat for abandoning the small businesses that helped build its popularity.</p>

In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas urged the community to remain calm and be aware of their rights, reflecting a heightened state of fear that has swept through Southern California. This local alert follows weeks of intensified raids by the Trump administration, which have disrupted communities and led to the arrests of hundreds of undocumented immigrants, many without criminal records.

          <p>A debate is intensifying in Prague over the fate of the 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge, an iconic industrial landmark. The national Railway Authority plans to dismantle the corroded structure and replace it with a new, three-track bridge to accommodate growing rail traffic, relocating the old bridge to a different site. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and preservationists argues that the historic bridge can and should be repaired in place, preserving a crucial part of the city's skyline. With support from Unesco and thousands of petitioners, they propose repairing the existing structure and adding a second, slender bridge to meet transport needs.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India crash that killed over 270 people found that fuel cutoff switches for both engines were activated moments after takeoff. The report, from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, noted that the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, which the other pilot denied doing. This action led to a catastrophic loss of thrust, with the flight lasting only 32 seconds before crashing. The investigation has not yet determined whether the action was intentional or inadvertent, but it suggests human action rather than mechanical failure was the cause.</p>

The move represents a potential trade war, with Trump using import taxes as a tool to interfere in the domestic judicial processes of another nation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on goods imported from Canada, a major escalation in trade tensions with one of the United States' largest trading partners. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl trafficking and its own retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the new duties, which are set to begin in August. This move is part of a broader strategy where Trump has sent similar letters to over 20 countries, signaling higher tariffs. The threat has created uncertainty in ongoing trade negotiations and challenges Carney's government to secure a favorable deal for Canada.</p>

However, his single father's persistence led to the discovery that Viraj could type with his right thumb, unlocking his ability to communicate via an iPad. This breakthrough revealed a brilliant mind, and in just three years, he progressed from basic math to calculus, graduating high school and earning a near-perfect ACT score, a victory for the entire non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>The BBC is confronting a difficult decision regarding the broadcast of its new season of MasterChef, which was filmed before presenter Gregg Wallace was sacked over misconduct allegations. While Wallace has apologized for inappropriate language, dozens more women have since come forward with new claims, which he denies. The dilemma for the BBC is whether to air the completed series, potentially causing a backlash and upsetting the accusers, or to shelve it, which would disappoint the contestants and waste the production crew's efforts. Options being considered include broadcasting as planned, shelving it entirely, or making it available only on the iPlayer streaming service.</p>

          <p>A large-scale federal raid on the Glass House cannabis operation in Southern California resulted in the detention of nearly 200 people, including minors, and caused widespread chaos. The operation, part of the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement, saw agents from multiple agencies descend on the facility, prompting workers to flee and hide. Farmworker advocates reported that one laborer was critically injured after falling from a greenhouse roof. The raid on the legal cannabis company, a major local employer, has fueled dueling political narratives about immigration, labor exploitation, and federal overreach, leaving the local immigrant community terrified.</p>

The judge ruled that the state's claims about the app's defective and dangerous features were specific enough to move forward.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing criticism over his strategy in trade negotiations with the U.S. following President Trump's latest threat of a 35% tariff on Canadian goods. Carney won the election vowing to be assertive with Trump, but recent concessions, such as scrapping a planned digital services tax, have yielded little apparent progress and drawn accusations of backing down. While his government maintains strong public support, some commentators and analysts question whether his approach will secure the fair deal he promised. The ongoing negotiations are a high-stakes test of Carney's ability to navigate the unpredictable and aggressive trade tactics of the Trump administration.</p>
