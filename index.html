          <p>Dozens of Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a special legislative session. Their departure aims to block a vote on a new congressional map that would significantly favor the GOP, a move Democrats call a "Trump gerrymander." The lawmakers accuse Governor Greg Abbott of holding disaster relief funds hostage to force the vote, while Republicans, including the state's attorney general, have threatened fines and arrests to compel their return. This action echoes previous quorum breaks by Texas Democrats in protest of Republican-led legislative efforts.</p>

          <p>A riot at a prison in Tuxpan, in the Mexican state of Veracruz, has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. The unrest reportedly began due to inmate anger over extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization within the facility. This event highlights broader systemic issues in Mexico's prison system, including overcrowding and control by cartels and gangs. Grupo Sombra is a known splinter group of the Gulf Cartel, notorious for both violence and attempts at public relations through "social work."</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones to dramatically increase their survival rate against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small, side-mounted rocket boosters to drones, enabling them to perform high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before impact. According to simulations published in a Chinese defense journal, this system could boost a drone's ability to penetrate defenses to nearly 90%, a substantial increase from current observed rates.</p>

          <p>A 51-year-old woman has died and another was seriously injured following an attack by multiple dogs at Perris Hill Park in San Bernardino, California. Police responded to a chaotic scene and encountered several canines, believed to be strays. During the incident, an officer shot and killed one of the attacking dogs, a pit bull, when it charged at them and the first injured victim. The deceased woman, Teodora Mendoza, was found nearby with severe injuries, and animal control subsequently removed 14 dogs from the park as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Avril Benoit, the CEO of Doctors Without Borders USA, described the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza, detailing severe trauma injuries and a man-made famine. She noted that aid distribution sites are scenes of chaos and violence, leading to numerous casualties. When the host shifted the focus to a video of a malnourished Israeli hostage released by Hamas, Benoit reaffirmed that the Israeli-controlled blockade is starving everyone, including hostages. She emphasized that U.S. backing of Israeli policies makes it complicit in the crisis.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade negotiations, China has firmly rejected U.S. demands to cease purchasing oil from Russia and Iran, stating it will protect its national interests and energy security. The U.S. had threatened a 100% tariff, but Beijing's response underscores its confidence in resisting American pressure, especially on issues linking trade to its foreign policy. The U.S. seeks to limit revenue for Russia's war in Ukraine and Iran's regional activities, but China remains a critical customer for both nations, benefiting from discounted prices. This standoff highlights a significant point of contention even as both sides express optimism about reaching a broader trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that this consumer debt prevents individuals from building personal wealth and instead enriches lenders. Ramsey advocates for a strict three-step plan to regain financial control: creating a zero-based budget, aggressively paying down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and paying for all purchases with cash.

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson narrowly missed out on a spot in the 200-meter final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships, finishing fourth in her heat by just one-hundredth of a second. This result ends her chances of competing in the 200m event at the upcoming World Championships. The disappointing performance on the track concludes a difficult week for the 25-year-old athlete, who was arrested days earlier over a domestic violence allegation. As the defending 100m world champion, she still holds an automatic spot to compete in that event.</p>

          <p>Following the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, the U.S. government has secured what President Trump termed a "golden share," granting it significant oversight in the company's operations. This national security agreement, negotiated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), stipulates that Nippon cannot change the company's name, must invest billions in updates, and cannot close factories without presidential approval. While not a traditional golden share involving equity, it grants the government extraordinary governance rights, reflecting a broader use of CFIUS to protect national security.

          <p>A new podcast series from NPR's Embedded, titled "Tested," examines the long and contentious history of sex testing in sports, an issue recently highlighted by new World Athletics regulations requiring genetic testing for female competitors. The series host, Rose Eveleth, notes that such policies echo past practices and often target women with natural biological variations, raising complex questions about fairness, science, and inclusion. The podcast delves into how these rules impact athletes, particularly cisgender women with differences in sex development and transgender women, and questions the motivations behind protecting the "female category."</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report with downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pointed to the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, while Trump claimed the numbers were "rigged." The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent. Critics argue Trump is "shooting the messenger" for weak economic news and attempting to install loyalists to manipulate future reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent court filing, Trump administration lawyers denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, a claim that contradicts previous public statements by White House adviser Stephen Miller. Miller had stated on Fox News that the administration was looking to set a "goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day." The Justice Department's filing, part of a lawsuit over unconstitutional immigration sweeps, asserts that no such policy or directive has been issued to DHS or ICE. This discrepancy highlights the aggressive rhetoric surrounding the administration's immigration enforcement agenda.</p>
