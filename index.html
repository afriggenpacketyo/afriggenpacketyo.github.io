          <h2>California Crab Season Threatened by Whale Migration, Innovative Fishing Tech Offers Hope</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 22:51:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern California's Dungeness crab season faces disruption due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in traditional fishing ropes. Fisherman Brand Little utilizes a U.S. military-developed pop-up system, costing $50 per cage, to minimize rope usage and prevent whale injuries, allowing him to continue fishing. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the season to protect whales, but Little's investment of $25,000 allows him to fish while avoiding harm to the whales. The technology is an experiment sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is tasked with regulating the crab fishing season. </p>

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has voiced skepticism regarding the recent Blue Origin space flight, suggesting that the trip may not have actually occurred. O'Neal's theory centers on his belief that Jeff Bezos would not risk sending his fianc√©e, Lauren Sanchez, into space, pointing to discrepancies within a video released by Blue Origin. He noted that the hair of those on board, including Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez, did not appear to move in zero gravity. The mission, which lasted 10 minutes and 21 seconds, was attended by several celebrities, including Oprah.</p>

          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is not fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, starting June 1, despite assurances from Acting Administrator David Richardson that the agency is about 80-85% ready. The review cites staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and a lack of coordination with states as contributing factors. Richardson aims to safeguard the American people, prioritize state responses, and coordinate federal assistance when necessary, emphasizing that FEMA will focus on its legal obligations.

          <p>New York University has withheld the diploma of a graduate, Logan Rozos, who condemned the "atrocities currently happening in Palestine" during his commencement speech. The university accused Rozos of abusing the privilege of speaking to express personal political views, with an NYU spokesperson stating the university "strongly denounces" his remarks. Rozos, who identified himself as an "actor, artist, and gay Black trans man," accused the U.S. of supporting "genocide" in Gaza, which led to disciplinary action by the university. The incident occurs amidst heightened scrutiny of pro-Palestinian advocacy on college campuses and investigations into antisemitism at elite institutions.</p>

This action signals a continuation of the administration's efforts to dismantle the broadcaster, despite a court ruling ordering the maintenance of robust news programming. The administration also put the VOA's Washington building up for sale, and the terminated journalists, some from countries with repressive governments, face deportation.

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices have raised concerns about President Donald Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship through an executive order, which would deny citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The court is considering the argument that federal judges' ‚Äúnationwide injunctions‚Äù unfairly restrict the president's authority. The administration seeks to narrow the scope of these injunctions, applying them only to the parties involved in the lawsuit. This executive order directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States.</p>

The Supreme Court is now reviewing whether a single federal judge should have the power to dictate policy nationwide through injunctions.

The Trump administration lowered the tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, but Walmart CFO John David Rainey warned that a restoration of higher tariff levels could significantly impact the company's financials and earnings growth.

          <p>An audit of deaths in Maryland has revealed that medical examiners miscategorized dozens of deaths that occurred in police custody over the past two decades, with at least 36 deaths that should have been classified as homicides. The report cited evidence of racism and pro-police bias, indicating that medical examiners were less likely to classify a death as a homicide if the deceased was Black or died after being restrained by police. The audit was prompted by the police killing of George Floyd and scrutiny of Dr. David R. Fowler's testimony in the Derek Chauvin trial.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took Treasury Department officials by surprise, leading to internal discussions to determine the scope and pace of the rollback. The decision, made during an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, lacks specifics and has prompted scrambling within Treasury to understand the implications. Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges, while Turkey and Saudi Arabia support normalizing relations with the country. The sanctions, some dating back to 1979, were imposed on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for terrorist groups.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year due to a sharp decrease in exports. The GDP data was worse than economists' expectations, with the annualized GDP contracting by 0.7%. Exports fell by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, negatively impacting the GDP due to uncertainties arising from President Trump's trade policies. The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned that the country's economy is likely to moderate due to the effects of global trade policies, although inflation in Japan has surpassed the BOJ's 2% target for three straight years, coming in most recently at 3.6% in April.</p>

          <p>More than 60,000 disabled households in England faced homelessness last year, marking a nearly 75% increase since 2019, according to official figures.

A government spokesperson stated that ¬£1bn is being allocated to councils to support families and prevent homelessness, while the Labour government claims it has invested an additional ¬£40bn into public services.</p>

Business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, has faced high duty tax bills and has had to increase prices on his products. The situation leaves many U.S. businesses in a dilemma, as they must decide whether to pay more to ship at the current tariff rate or wait in the hope that the Trump administration will lower the tariffs further.

The cases involve President Trump's executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which contradicts the 14th Amendment. The court's decision could significantly weaken the ability of the federal judiciary to check presidential actions. Erwin Chemerinsky argues that nationwide injunctions are necessary to uphold the rule of law, while others claim they prevent the executive branch from carrying out its duties.</p>

The Efra Committee said the changes were made without "adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment" and threaten to affect the most vulnerable. The NFU said the policy remained "fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed". The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive affected trust in the government.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former Sheriff Alex Villanueva‚Äôs $25-million lawsuit against Los Angeles County, alleging defamation and violation of rights. The lawsuit claimed that Villanueva lost employment opportunities due to a "do not rehire" notation in his personnel file, stemming from a county panel's determination that he harassed two officials. The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove Villanueva had been harmed or that the designation had caused him to lose out on a desired position. Villanueva's attorney stated that the complaints of defamation and emotional distress will move forward in state court.</p>
