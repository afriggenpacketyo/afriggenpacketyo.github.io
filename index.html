          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with the United Kingdom, signaling a significant step in U.S.-UK economic relations. The announcement, made in the Oval Office, highlights the administration's focus on reshaping international trade agreements. Separately, First Lady Melania Trump hosted a stamp unveiling for former First Lady Barbara Bush. On foreign policy, the administration is closely monitoring developments between Pakistan and India after recent exchanges of fire, and Trump mentioned a potential ceasefire and hostage deal proposal for Israel and Hamas within the next 24 hours.</p>

The move began after Trump teased the announcement on Truth Social, calling it a "full and comprehensive one."

          <p>The Trump administration is set to end the Biden-era U.S. chip export restrictions, known as the "AI diffusion rule," which limits the export of advanced AI chips. This decision effectively stops the restrictions from taking effect next week. Nvidia shares climbed in response to the news, as the company has been vocal about its belief that restricting chip exports limits U.S. leadership in advanced technology. The rule, proposed during Biden's last days, organized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on AI chip exports, which were scheduled to take effect on May 15.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan are high following a series of attacks in Kashmir, impacting cricket relations between the two countries. The teams rarely play each other outside of global events organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC).

Travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other compliant form of identification may face extra security hurdles. The TSA estimates that about 81% of travelers are Real ID-compliant.

          <p>A report from the Office for Students (OfS) reveals that over 40% of universities in England expect to be in a financial deficit by this summer. Universities are closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but "significant reform and efficiencies" are deemed necessary. The drop in international students, particularly after visa changes in January 2024, is the primary reason for the worsening financial position. Universities UK (UUK) described the report as "deeply sobering," while the University and College Union called on the government and university leaders to protect higher education.</p>

          <p>The EU is considering imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports in an attempt to persuade Donald Trump to drop tariffs against the EU. These tariffs would impact Boeing and include chemicals, electrical equipment, health-related products, and some foods. Brussels has launched a consultation with member states on potential litigation against the US over reciprocal tariffs. The EU said its list of potential tariff targets was designed as preparation for a scenario in which some or all US tariffs remained after Trump’s deadline. The EU also renewed threats to include services, which could include duties on US tech and social media companies.</p>

          <p>Experts say that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt could make sense, but it's not always the best option. High interest rates and record consumer debt continue to strain borrowers. Paying off high-interest debt offers an immediate and higher return compared to long-term market returns. However, if balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or being managed effectively, the inheritance money might be better used to build savings or invest.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney has announced that he will not support a bill that would allow assisted dying in Scotland, citing concerns that it would fundamentally change the relationships between patients and clinicians. Swinney also expressed worries that vulnerable individuals might feel pressured to end their lives prematurely. The vote on the legislation, which would allow terminally ill people to take their own lives under specific conditions, is scheduled for May 13. Swinney acknowledged the efforts to produce a more considered proposal but remains unconvinced.</p>

          <p>An autopsy suggests that the South Carolina firing squad execution of Mikal Mahdi last month was botched, with shooters missing the target area on his heart, causing him to suffer a prolonged death, according to autopsy records and his attorneys. The autopsy revealed only two gunshot wounds, not three, and the bullets hit his pancreas, liver, and lower lung, largely missing his heart. A forensic pathologist retained by Mahdi’s lawyers concluded that Mahdi experienced excruciating conscious pain and suffering for about 30 to 60 seconds. The state supreme court previously assessed that the method was not cruel based on the assumption that the SCDC could be entrusted to carry out its straightforward steps.</p>

Mr. Schurr took the stand during the trial and said that he feared for his life when he opened fire at the driver, Patrick Lyoya, after Mr. Lyoya grabbed his stun gun. The central question the jury was asked to weigh in the six-day trial was whether Mr. Schurr’s use of deadly force was justified.</p>

This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland to begin negotiations over the trade war that has strangled commerce between the two powers. According to the Atlantic article, Trump’s negotiating position will be the weaker one. Already in recent months, U.S. policy has appeared to vacillate, its strategy and goals uncertain, while Chinese leader Xi Jinping has held fast, presented an image of strength, and kept his larger geopolitical goals in focus. China has taken the opportunity of the chaos of Trump’s trade policy to draw other countries, including American allies, closer to itself.</p>

Governor Andrew Bailey cited the slowdown in inflation as the reason for the cut, but warned of the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4% but decided against it due to concerns about the impact of a global trade war. The decision comes as details of a tariff deal between the UK and US are set to be announced later.</p>
