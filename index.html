          <h2>RTX and GE Aerospace Project Over $1 Billion Tariff Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 10:50:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>RTX and GE Aerospace anticipate a combined impact exceeding $1 billion due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported goods and materials, signaling rising costs for major U.S. manufacturers relying on global supply chains. RTX expects an $850 million hit this year from tariffs, including those on China and steel/aluminum imports, though this figure doesn't account for mitigation efforts. GE Aerospace, while maintaining its 2025 earnings outlook, plans to cut costs and raise prices to save around $500 million, according to CEO Larry Culp, who recently discussed the aerospace sector's trade surplus with Trump.</p>

          <p>A formal public inquiry, led by Her Honour Deborah Taylor, has been announced in Parliament to investigate the Nottingham attacks that occurred on June 13, 2023, resulting in the deaths of Ian Coates, Barnaby Webber, and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, who were killed by Valdo Calocane. The inquiry follows widespread criticism from the victims' families regarding the authorities' handling of the case. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the inquiry aims to address concerns and provide a thorough examination of the events surrounding the tragic incident. The goal is to provide some closure to the families involved and to prevent similar tragedies from happening again.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's official spokesman stated that Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, citing the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines a woman by biological sex under equalities law. This contrasts with Starmer's previous statement in 2022, where he said that trans women are women. Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson said single-sex spaces should be designated on the basis of biological sex, and that the EHRC will set out additional guidance. This stance has caused unease among some Labour MPs, despite commitments in Labour's manifesto to support trans rights.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts slower U.S. economic growth in 2025, projecting a 1.8% growth rate, down from previous estimates, due to an escalating trade war initiated by President Trump's tariffs. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas warns that the global economic system is being reset, with the odds of a U.S. recession rising from 25% to 37%. The IMF also slashed the global economic growth forecast to 2.8% and cited uncertainty over Trump's trade policy as the primary driver of the U.S. economic slowdown, emphasizing that trade stability has been disrupted by America's tariff war.</p>

          <p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth stated that the company is not seeing signs of an imminent U.S. recession, despite concerns about President Trump's tariffs impacting oil demand. Wirth acknowledged potential slowing growth but emphasized preparedness, noting that the oil market anticipates reduced demand due to tariffs and increased OPEC+ production. While Chevron isn't altering its capital spending plans, Wirth suggested that U.S. onshore oil production could decrease if prices fall to $60 per barrel, but he does not expect a major direct impact on Chevron's business from the tariffs themselves.</p>

Gore criticized the administration's views on climate change, claiming they dismiss it as a hoax and promote false narratives about coal and renewable energy.

          <p>Multiple tourists were killed and others injured in a terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir's Pahalgam area, a popular tourist destination. Reports indicate that suspected militants opened fire on civilians, with some outlets citing unnamed security officials who put the death toll as high as 24, though authorities have not confirmed the exact number of casualties. The attack, which is the worst in the region in nearly a year, occurred as U.S. Vice President JD Vance visited India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack, vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice, and Home Minister Amit Shah announced plans to visit the region to review security measures.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced a proposed reorganization of the U.S. State Department, aiming to reform it amidst criticism from the Trump White House regarding the execution of U.S. diplomacy. The reorganization will involve closing overseas missions, reducing staff, and minimizing offices dedicated to promoting liberal values, with the goal of integrating these functions into regional bureaus. Rubio stated the current bureaucracy is beholden to radical political ideology rather than advancing America's national interests. Region-specific functions will be consolidated, redundant offices removed, and non-statutory programs misaligned with core interests will be eliminated.</p>

          <p>Major Russian banks have established a netting payments system called "The China Track" for transactions with China, aiming to reduce visibility to Western regulators and mitigate the risk of secondary sanctions. This system, set up by sanctioned banks and involving intermediaries in friendly countries, addresses payment problems and high commissions that have affected Russia-China trade, which hit a record $245 billion last year. The banks settle trade in both directions without using SWIFT or accounts in Western banks, providing guarantees for payments and insuring against default.

          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 level for the first time since March, driven by investors seeking an alternative to the diving dollar and turbulent stock market. The cryptocurrency's rise coincides with a sell-off in U.S. equities and President Trump's pressure on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to lower rates. U.S. ETFs tracking the price of spot bitcoin saw significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest. While bitcoin was previously vulnerable to stock market volatility, it has recently decoupled from risk assets, showing resilience amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has introduced a plan to promote the use of the yuan and its own payment system in international trade, aiming to reduce dependence on the dollar amid trade tensions with the United States. The plan, led by Shanghai's municipal government, the People’s Bank of China, and financial regulators, seeks to enhance the functionality of the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). The move aims to support Chinese enterprises expanding globally and advance the Belt and Road Initiative, while enabling safer and more efficient international trade transactions. Settling more transactions in yuan would strengthen China's position in global trade and mitigate potential harm from U.S. financial actions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attacks on Harvard University, including the revocation of federal research funding, are part of a broader strategy by right-wing activists to force liberal institutions to align with their ideology. This effort is rooted in the belief that elite academic and media institutions, referred to as "the Cathedral," dominate US culture and promote progressive views. Trump's actions, such as demanding viewpoint diversity audits and threatening the university's nonprofit status, are seen as attempts to coerce Harvard and other universities into submission. While Harvard's prestige and resources may help it withstand these attacks, the long-term implications for the relationship between universities and the federal government are uncertain.</p>
