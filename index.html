          <p>Bridgend council in Wales faced criticism for a PowerPoint presentation that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex, intended for use in schools. The presentation included a slide stating, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first," raising concerns among experts and politicians about the appropriateness of including such content in sex education. The council claimed the slide was part of a draft version and was removed following feedback, but the incident has sparked questions about the quality and oversight of sex education materials in schools.

The article also highlights the roles of Saudi Arabia and Iran as key mediators, and warns that issues such as terrorism and water security still pose long-term challenges.

          <p>The UK government is toughening migration rules, requiring adults accompanying foreign workers to pass English language tests and restricting care homes from recruiting staff from abroad. The move is seen as a challenge to Reform UK, with new immigrants having to earn the "privilege, not right" to settle in the UK. Automatic settlement and citizenship for those living in the UK for five years will also end, with priority given to those who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer in the community. The Daily Telegraph highlights the government plans to tighten legislation allowing asylum to foreign criminals.</p>
