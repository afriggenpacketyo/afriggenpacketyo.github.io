            <h2>China Considers Settling Trade in Renminbi Amid US Tariff Hikes</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 08:30:08 EDT</div>

            <p>In response to escalating trade tensions with the United States, China is contemplating a strategic shift by mandating that bilateral trade be settled in renminbi. This move aims to challenge the dominance of the US dollar and strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate. The proposal would force the US to purchase large quantities of Chinese currency, increasing demand and pushing up its value. This approach is viewed as a proactive measure against what China perceives as emotional and irrational tariff hikes by the Trump administration, potentially attracting global investors seeking economic stability.

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia is attempting to create a false impression of adhering to an Easter ceasefire while continuing attacks. Despite Vladimir Putin's declaration of a unilateral truce, Ukrainian forces reported numerous instances of Russian shelling, drone strikes, and assaults along the front line. Zelenskyy suggested that either Putin lacks full control over his army or Russia is insincere about ending the war, seeking only favorable PR coverage. He reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days, contingent on the actual situation on the ground.</p>

            <p>Concerns are mounting over the safety of Christians in Nigeria, with reports of increasing violence and persecution by Islamist militants. Jeff King, president of International Christian Concern (ICC), claims that Christians are being systematically targeted in a "genocide," particularly in Nigeria’s Middle Belt. He alleges a calculated effort by Fulani extremists to displace Christians from their land, with numerous attacks resulting in deaths, displacement, and property destruction. Calls are growing for the U.S. State Department to designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern and impose sanctions until the violence is addressed.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent actions against Harvard University represent the latest front in a long-standing conservative effort to undermine and control higher education, according to experts. The Trump administration's move to freeze grants to Harvard followed the university's refusal to comply with demands for government oversight of hiring, admissions, and curriculum. Critics argue that these actions are part of a broader authoritarian playbook to suppress independent thought and academic freedom, echoing historical efforts like McCarthyism. This situation raises concerns about the future of academic freedom and the role of universities in a democratic society.</p>

We should address security issues without linking them to tariffs," Ishiba said on a TV program, days after his close aide met with Trump and senior U.S. officials on the recently increased levies.</p>
