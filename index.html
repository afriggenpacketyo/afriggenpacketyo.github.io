          <p>A South African woman, Racquel "Kelly" Smith, received a life sentence for kidnapping and trafficking her six-year-old daughter, Joshlin Smith, along with her boyfriend and a friend. The sentencing follows a six-week trial that captivated South Africa, where allegations of selling Joshlin to a traditional healer for her eyes and skin surfaced. Despite extensive searches, Joshlin remains missing, leaving the community fractured and heartbroken. The judge emphasized the trio's lack of remorse, and police have vowed to continue the search for the young girl, even beyond South Africa's borders, to find out what happened to Joshlin.</p>

          <p>Harvard Medical School has experienced the termination of at least 350 research grants due to the ongoing conflict between Harvard University and the Trump administration over allegations of unchecked antisemitism on campus and DEI practices.

          <p>Shawn Carney, president and CEO of 40 Days for Life, has praised Texas lawmakers for passing a bill that mandates the display of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom. Carney believes the bill represents a step in the right direction and reflects a broader cultural shift towards moral clarity. He argues that the legislation does not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and frames it as a response to a secular "woke mentality." The bill, awaiting Governor Greg Abbott's signature, has sparked debate over its constitutionality and potential impact on religious freedom.</p>

          <p>Xiaomi has launched its new YU7 sports utility vehicle in Beijing, aiming to compete with Tesla in the electric vehicle market. The YU7 follows the success of Xiaomi's SU7 sedan, which has outsold Tesla's Model 3 since December, but the launch comes amidst controversies surrounding a fatal crash involving an SU7 and complaints of misleading marketing. Analysts predict the YU7 could pose a significant threat to Tesla's Model Y, citing Xiaomi's understanding of Chinese consumers and its competitive pricing, which is estimated to range between 230,000 yuan and 330,000 yuan. Visitors to the showroom noted the car's styling, color, and integration with Xiaomi's ecosystem of gadgets and smart home products.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, but Wall Street analysts remain largely optimistic due to strong demand for AI infrastructure products. The company attributed the shortfall to the US ban on H20 chip shipments to China, which is expected to impact sales significantly. However, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the "incredibly strong" global demand for Nvidia's AI technology and its efficient ramp-up in production of the Blackwell chip. Analysts from Citi and D.A. Davidson offered varying perspectives, with Citi raising its price target and D.A. Davidson highlighting concerns over Nvidia's access to the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, as part of a series of clemency actions. Despite the commutation, Hoover will remain in prison due to a 200-year state sentence for murder, which a president cannot commute. Hoover, who has publicly disavowed gang life, was serving six life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges. The move comes after years of advocacy for criminal justice reform, including the First Step Act, and follows public support from figures like Kanye West.</p>

Instead, they suggest Trump should increase pressure on both Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal, leveraging potential sanctions and economic support to incentivize a truce that acknowledges Russia's territorial gains while integrating Ukraine further into the European economy.</p>

He contends that the administration's framing of Black history as "DEI" and a threat to white Americans mirrors historical justifications for racist violence.

          <p>Hungary under Viktor OrbÃ¡n has become an inspiration for U.S. conservatives, despite critics labeling his rule a "dictatorship." OrbÃ¡n has reshaped the courts, stifled independent press, and passed laws restricting civil society, leading to concerns about democratic regression. American conservatives admire OrbÃ¡n's confrontational approach to immigration and "woke" policies, seeing Hungary as a model for conservative populism. However, analysts warn that OrbÃ¡n's tactics, including weaponizing the state budget and gerrymandering, could be replicated in the U.S., posing a threat to democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed plans to bolster advanced manufacturing, a strategy criticized by the U.S. and major trade partners for deepening global trade imbalances. This push for self-reliance in high-tech sectors could run counter to the Trump administration's demands in ongoing trade talks, which include addressing trade imbalances and reducing state subsidies. Experts warn that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, potentially leading to continued trade tensions between the two countries. Despite state support, China has faced challenges in meeting key targets from its "Made in China 2025" plan.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly released an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, escalating competition with OpenAI. The upgraded model, released on Hugging Face, is a reasoning model capable of executing complex tasks through logical thought. DeepSeek's rise to prominence this year, with its low-cost and short development time, has sparked concerns that U.S. tech giants are overspending on infrastructure. The upgraded model is just behind OpenAI's models on LiveCodeBench.</p>
