        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon organizers have issued an apology after the electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated, causing it to miss three crucial calls in a single game. The error occurred during a fourth-round match involving Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who stated a game was 'stolen' from her due to the malfunction. The All England Club attributed the incident to human error and has since reviewed its procedures. Despite the controversy, Pavlyuchenkova ultimately went on to win the match, mitigating the potential impact of the technological failure.</p>

          <p>Among the at least 79 fatalities from catastrophic flash flooding in Central Texas were two sisters from Dallas, 13-year-old Blair and 11-year-old Brooke Harber. Their deaths were confirmed by their school community, which held a prayer service in their memory. The girls were staying with their grandparents, who remain missing, in a cabin along the Guadalupe River when it surged unexpectedly. The devastating floods have been declared a 'mass casualty event,' with extensive search and rescue operations ongoing, particularly for campers missing from the hard-hit Camp Mystic.</p>

          <p>The response to devastating flash floods in central Texas is transitioning from rescue to a grim recovery operation, with the death toll confirmed at 78 and dozens still missing. A primary focus remains on Camp Mystic, where 10 girls and a counselor are unaccounted for after the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. The article explores the growing scrutiny over the effectiveness and timing of emergency warnings, as some residents claim they received no alerts before the deluge hit, prompting questions for local and state officials.</p>

          <p>In a joint declaration from their Rio summit, BRICS leaders condemned recent strikes on Iran and criticized unilateral trade tariffs, though the statement carefully avoided directly naming the United States or Israel. The document expressed "grave concern" over Middle East violence and called for a two-state solution for Palestine, while also denouncing trade-distorting tariff measures. This diplomatic language highlights the bloc's effort to present a united front while navigating complex geopolitical relationships.</p>

          <p>A review of recent macroeconomic data suggests the U.S. economy, while still growing, is showing signs of cooling from its previously hot pace. The labor market continues to add jobs, but at a slower rate, and wage growth has moderated, while some business investment indicators have faded. While a recession is not guaranteed, the combination of these trends with potential disruptions from AI and trade policy suggests a cautious short-term outlook for the American economy.

While the music mogul was found not guilty on the most serious counts, he remains jailed after being convicted on lesser prostitution-related charges and faces several more years in prison. His defense team successfully argued that while Combs was a domestic abuser, his actions did not constitute a trafficking conspiracy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported eight men to South Sudan, a country grappling with instability and conflict, following a protracted legal battle. The men, convicted of serious crimes including murder and sexual assault in the U.S., were flown out after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had required due process hearings for such third-country deportations. The move is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand deportations to countries other than the individuals' home nations.</p>
