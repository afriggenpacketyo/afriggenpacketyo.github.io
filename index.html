          <p>Samsung Electronics reported better-than-expected operating profit and revenue for the first quarter, driven by strong sales of Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The South Korean tech giant posted a record quarterly revenue, up 10% year-over-year, with operating profit increasing by 1.5%. Despite these positive results, Samsung cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties arising from trade tensions and slower global growth, anticipating improved performance in the second half of the year if these uncertainties diminish. Shares of Samsung Electronics listed in South Korea experienced a slight decline of approximately 0.4%.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber issued an apology after the release of internal reports revealing antisemitic and anti-Muslim prejudice on campus. The reports, commissioned after pro-Palestinian protests, included student testimonies describing feelings of alienation and pressure to conceal their identities. In response to the findings, Harvard has pledged to review its academic offerings and admissions policies to ensure applicants are evaluated based on their ability to engage constructively with diverse perspectives and show empathy. The university's remedial actions appear to fall short of the White House's demands for an end to preferences based on race and the implementation of merit-based policies.</p>

          <p>Mexico’s Attorney General Alejandro Gertz stated that an abandoned ranch in western Mexico, previously described as an “extermination camp” by groups searching for missing relatives, was used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel for training and recruiting. Gertz clarified that there is no evidence to support claims of human cremations at the site, contradicting earlier reports. Despite finding small bone fragments, studies did not indicate the high temperatures required for cremation. Leaders of search groups maintain their belief that the ranch was used for extermination based on their findings, criticizing the government's attempt to alter the narrative.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, announced a second round of tariff talks with the United States to address higher duties affecting autos, steel, and other sectors. Akazawa aims to establish a "win-win" relationship with the Trump administration. The U.S. has expressed concerns over the volume of U.S.-made cars imported into Japan and is urging Japan to open its market to more U.S.-grown crops. Japan is considering increasing imports of U.S.-grown soybeans and corn and simplifying safety checks for imported cars to encourage Washington to review the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors for the Southern District of New York have refuted allegations that they eavesdropped on phone calls between Luigi Mangione and his attorney, Karen Agnifilo. Prosecutors explained that the Metropolitan Detention Center, where Mangione is held, routinely records jail lines, and Mangione mistakenly used one of these monitored lines instead of a designated attorney line. Recordings of these calls were sent to prosecutors but a paralegal recognized the error and stopped listening, notifying both prosecution teams. Prosecutors assert that no member of the federal team listened to the calls and the recordings have been segregated.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were in housing, education, and food. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut rates to 4.1% from 4.35% due to softening inflation. The RBA anticipates growth in Australia's economy and a strong labor market in 2025, but global uncertainties remain. The inflation data was released as Australia prepares for an election on May 3, where the Labor Party holds a lead over the Liberal-National opposition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump eased the impact of his new 25% tariffs on the auto industry, allowing American and foreign automakers producing vehicles in the United States to claim some reimbursements over the next two years. This move aims to help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts to the United States. Automakers will be allowed to offset a percentage of the retail price of automobiles assembled in the U.S., and will only pay the highest applicable tariff without being hit by other new duties. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the United States is close to reaching a tariff deal with India.</p>

Gilead provided honoraria payments, meals, and travel expenses to doctors who spoke at HIV Speaker Program events from 2011 through 2017, violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The settlement stems from a civil lawsuit filed by Dr. Paul Bellman, a New York physician specializing in HIV/AIDS treatment.

          <h2>Trump Administration Dismisses Scientists Working on National Climate Report</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed nearly 400 scientists involved in writing the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report summarizing climate change impacts in the United States. The administration claims it is reevaluating the scope of the assessment, but concerns have arisen about the report's credibility without the expertise of these scientists. Critics argue that this move aligns with a plan to reshape the report and include "diverse viewpoints" on climate change, potentially undermining its scientific integrity.</p>

Authorities estimate that 100 people attended a vigil at the home of Alejandro Oliveros Acosta, who was arrested on suspicion of felony animal cruelty. Protesters threw objects at the house and attempted to break down a fence, leading to a police investigation of vandalism and battery. Police are asking the public to allow the investigation and judicial process to take their course.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has begun prosecuting migrants for entering a newly declared military buffer zone along the border with Mexico. At least 28 migrants were charged in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, for crossing into the militarized zone patrolled by active-duty U.S. troops. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico expressed concerns about the militarization of borderlands communities and the erosion of constitutional principles. Migrants detained in the area were charged with both crossing the border illegally and entering a restricted area.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to disburse congressionally approved grant money to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a news organization providing independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. The judge ordered the administration to pay $12 million for April funding, rejecting the administration's attempts to withhold the money while negotiating new terms. The judge defended the nonpartisan nature of the federal judiciary, rejecting accusations that he was dictating administration policy. The ruling follows previous orders to restore operations at Voice of America and halt efforts to shut down other federally funded newsrooms.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that partially reversed some tariffs for carmakers, addressing concerns that the levies would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Carmakers will also qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of imported components, phased out over two years. However, analysts warn that even with these concessions, administration policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers.</p>

A settlement could help facilitate the Skydance deal, but a large payment could be viewed as a payoff to gain the Trump administration's approval, sparking internal protests within the company.</p>
