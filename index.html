          <p>The Science and Technology Secretary has called on the police to "do their bit" in embracing change as the Home Office and Treasury negotiate this week's Spending Review. While acknowledging financial pressures across various sectors, the minister emphasized the need for police modernization and technology adoption. The Shadow Home Secretary voiced concerns about potential police number cuts, urging the government to protect their budget. The Chancellor is set to outline departmental spending plans, highlighting the need for difficult choices amid competing demands, as the government has already provided an additional Â£1bn to the police.</p>

          <p>Health workers in Gaza have reported that at least four Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near an aid distribution center. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that warning shots were fired after a verbal challenge to a group perceived as a threat. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly events near aid distribution points established by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), supported by Israel and the US. The IDF has designated areas around GHF distribution sites as active combat zones outside of specified hours, exacerbating the danger for civilians seeking aid, as one woman said her husband was shot in the head while waiting for food.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the potential deployment of US Marines in the state as "deranged" after the Secretary of Defense suggested it amid immigration protests. Tensions escalated following immigration raids in Los Angeles, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, including the use of tear gas. President Trump promised to send in the National Guard, a move Newsom confirmed, accusing the federal government of inflaming tensions. While the Los Angeles mayor stated that the National Guard had not yet been deployed, the US attorney warned protesters engaging in unlawful behavior would face federal prosecution.</p>

          <p>The article presents a poem reflecting on the beauty and minutiae of nature, contrasting it with the relentless pace of modern life. The speaker expresses a lack of desire for space exploration or deep-sea ventures, instead finding joy in simple observations like gold flares in cottonwood leaves and the scent of piÃ±on and juniper. Recalling Blake's wisdom that persistence in folly can lead to wisdom, the speaker acknowledges their own perseverance. The poem culminates in an appreciation for life's exploding, birthing stars, capturing a sense of wonder and gratitude.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that Israel would not allow any attempts to break its naval blockade of the Palestinian territory. The blockade is aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. Thunberg is among 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, seeking to deliver humanitarian aid and raise awareness about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes cuts to Pell Grants, which could significantly impact low-income students' access to college. The cuts would result in the lowest maximum Pell Grant in over a decade, potentially forcing students to drop out or take on more debt. Experts warn that these cuts would disproportionately affect the lowest-income families. Despite the potential shortfall, the proposal is considered an "extreme" measure, as Congress has historically provided additional funding to address such situations. (not investment advice)</p>

By making Jewish life less secure outside of Israel, the perpetrators of these attacks undermine the arguments against Zionism. These attacks have raised the costs of being Jewish in America.</p>
