          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated that she and the LAPD are considering curfews and other responses in case violence breaks out again, following some looting on Monday night during protests. Bass said the vandalism and violence are unacceptable, arguing that those individuals aren’t in support of immigrants and "have another agenda." She noted that the unrest is limited to a few blocks within the downtown area, not the entire city. Bass stressed that the protests stem from recent immigration raids, which she said left immigrant families across LA "terrified" and unsure if they should go to school or work, urging ICE to stop the raids.</p>

          <p>Sen. Ashley Moody has introduced the "RIPPLE Act" to expand the 287(g) program, enabling states to assist in immigration enforcement by allowing non-federal law enforcement officers to act as a "force multiplier" for federal immigration officers. This bill aims to expand eligible reimbursable expenses for state and local law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) program, allowing them to commit officers to immigration enforcement while new federal officers are trained. The legislation comes amid violent protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement efforts, with President Trump deploying the National Guard and Marines to the city. Moody also introduced the "Stop GAPS Act" to require the Office of Refugee Resettlement to work with states to find homes for unaccompanied children and track them throughout immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Fort Bragg after deploying the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests. Approximately 700 active-duty Marines arrived in the Los Angeles area to integrate with the National Guard, protecting federal personnel and property, costing an estimated $134 million for up to two months. California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the president and Hegseth over the deployment, arguing it bypasses the governor's authority under Title 10 of the U.S. code. Trump claimed that Los Angeles would be "burning to the ground" without his actions, labeling the protesters "paid insurrectionists."</p>

          <p>BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink believes that the company's acquisition of Preqin, an alternative asset data provider, could be its most consequential deal, potentially revolutionizing private markets. Preqin's data will be integrated into BlackRock platforms like Aladdin and eFront, providing clients with enhanced visibility into non-public investments. This move aims to bring transparency to private markets, similar to what Zillow did for housing, and reduce BlackRock's reliance on the volatile stock market. The deal is expected to attract more clients, deepen existing relationships, and expand BlackRock's presence in the growing private markets sector, despite potential regulatory scrutiny.

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is facing concerns about a potential financial crisis due to an intense price war led by BYD, which is depressing profits for manufacturers and sellers. The People's Daily published a commentary warning that disorderly price wars squeeze profits and risk income declines for workers, deeming this competition unsustainable. BYD's price cuts, with discounts as steep as 34%, have led industry executives to express alarm, with the head of Great Wall Motor drawing parallels to China's property sector crisis and Evergrande. A government-backed industry group has also called on companies not to dump vehicles below production cost, highlighting the growing unease surrounding the EV market's stability.

She emphasizes the resilience and camaraderie within the immigrant community, highlighting their significant contributions to Los Angeles' culture and economy. Contrary to the narrative of Los Angeles being "invaded" and "lawless," she argues that immigrants have quietly built the city, citing their tax contributions and the Latino influence on its identity. She contrasts the media's focus on chaos and unrest with the everyday lives of immigrants who face challenges such as language barriers and exploitation, underscoring the need for nuanced storytelling that recognizes their humanity and sacrifices.</p>

Caruana Galizia was known for her extensive reporting on corruption and misconduct involving political and business figures, and her death triggered widespread protests.

          <p>A recent survey indicates that corporate leaders are increasingly optimistic about the U.S. economy, with most CEOs not expecting a recession this year. The June poll by Chief Executive found that only 28% of business leaders anticipate a near-term recession, a significant drop from 46% in May. CEOs are optimistic that the Trump administration will negotiate trade deals that mitigate the impact of tariffs. However, the World Bank forecasts U.S. economic growth of 1.4% for 2025, citing tariff risks, although recent measures of job growth and consumer spending suggest the economy is currently holding up.

The author reflects on the emotional distance of the AI, which, in a way, was helpful, providing assistance without feigning emotional connection, ultimately helping at a time when a little help was all that was wanted.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles to address immigration-enforcement protests is estimated to cost approximately $134 million. The acting Pentagon Comptroller, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, attributed the cost primarily to housing, travel, and food for the troops. The deployment, consisting of 4,000 members of the California National Guard and about 700 Marines, is being funded by the military's Operation & Maintenance accounts. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment, emphasizing the need for safe communities and the ability for ICE agents to perform their duties.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that emperor penguin populations in Antarctica may be declining faster than the most pessimistic predictions, based on satellite images from 2009 to 2024. The images indicate a 22% decline in the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea, and Bellingshausen Sea, representing a third of the global population. Researchers attribute the losses to climate change, with warming temperatures thinning and destabilizing the ice under the penguins' feet. While further analysis is needed, the speed of the declines is particularly alarming, suggesting that computer models may need to be rethought, although there is still time to reduce the threat by cutting planet-heating emissions.</p>
