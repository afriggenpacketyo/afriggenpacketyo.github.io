        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed suppliers to stop producing its H20 AI chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market. This move follows a directive from the Chinese government for local tech companies to cease purchasing the chips due to national security concerns, including fears of potential "backdoors" for remote access. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has addressed these concerns, stating no such backdoors exist, but the situation highlights the growing difficulty of navigating U.S.-China trade tensions in the high-stakes semiconductor industry. The company had previously taken a significant writedown on its H20 inventory due to U.S. export restrictions.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeast into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coast. While it did not make landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks, prompting some evacuations and a state of emergency declaration. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for "life-threatening surf and rip currents" along most of the U.S. East Coast, advising against swimming in many areas. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical over the weekend as it passes south of Atlantic Canada.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has revealed that corn plants can communicate with each other by releasing a gas called linalool when planted in dense fields. This chemical signal prompts neighboring plants to alter their soil composition, which helps deter herbivores and other pests. The research, conducted by an international team of scientists, observed that while this defensive mechanism reduces pest damage, it can also lead to reduced growth for the plants in the inner rows. These findings offer potential new strategies for optimizing crop yields and developing more natural pest control methods in agriculture.</p>

          <p>Colombia is facing a severe security crisis after two separate attacks attributed to FARC dissident factions killed at least 18 people. In the city of Cali, a car bomb targeting a military aviation school detonated on a busy street, killing six civilians and injuring over 60 others. In a separate incident near Medellin, a drone attack brought down a police helicopter involved in coca leaf eradication, resulting in the deaths of all 12 officers on board. The government has condemned the acts as terrorism and is convening a security council to address the escalating violence.</p>

          <p>After a lengthy hearing, a California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who was convicted alongside his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents. The panel determined that Menendez still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety, citing numerous prison rule violations as a primary factor in their decision. While Menendez and his supporters argued he has shown remorse and growth, the board was not convinced he was suitable for release. He will be eligible for another parole hearing in three years, while his brother Lyle's hearing is scheduled for the following day.</p>

          <p>According to court documents from a legal case between Elon Musk and OpenAI, Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to help finance a $97.4 billion takeover of the AI company in early 2025. The proposal was part of Musk's effort to prevent OpenAI, which he co-founded as a non-profit, from transitioning into a for-profit entity. Zuckerberg and Meta ultimately did not sign the letter of intent or participate in the bid. The revelation is part of OpenAI's counterclaims, which allege Musk's "sham bid" was intended to harm its business amid growing competition in the AI sector.</p>

Despite the cooling, this marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to adjust its monetary policy. The "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy prices, held steady at 3.4%, indicating persistent underlying price pressures in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Families who lost babies under the care of the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust feel "ignored and dismissed" after a meeting regarding a national review of maternity services. The group, which has been campaigning for an independent inquiry led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden, met with the newly appointed chair, Baroness Amos. The families stated that the chair seemed poorly briefed on their case and that no progress was made, calling the meeting "deeply dispiriting." They also raised concerns about the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, questioning the investigation's potential for true independence.</p>

          <p>The online message board 4chan has stated it will not pay fines proposed by Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, for non-compliance with the new Online Safety Act. A lawyer for the U.S.-based company said Ofcom's actions create no legal obligations in the United States and described the investigation as an "illegal campaign of harassment." The firm argues that as an American company, 4chan is protected by the First Amendment and that U.S. courts will not enforce foreign censorship codes or penal fines. This sets up a significant international clash over the extraterritorial reach of national internet regulations.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a legislative package to place a redistricting proposal on a special election ballot this November. The measure aims to redraw the state's congressional map to favor Democrats, potentially flipping up to five Republican-held seats. This move is a direct and strategic counter to a Republican-led effort in Texas, backed by Donald Trump, to create gerrymandered maps that benefit their party. Newsom framed the action as a necessary defense of democracy, arguing California could not allow "unilateral disarmament" while Republicans attempt to "rig the election" through partisan map-drawing.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new guidance for baby food manufacturers, instructing them to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products. The guidelines also call for an end to the promotion of snacks for babies under one year old and restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific proof. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the voluntary guidelines, with the government suggesting further action may be taken if they fail to do so.</p>

          <p>During a visit to a U.S. Park Police facility in Washington D.C., President Donald Trump praised his administration's crime crackdown in the city. Flanked by top officials, Trump declared the federal takeover of the city's police department a success. In freewheeling remarks, he also promised to replace the grass in the city's parks to make them resemble his golf courses, stating, "I know more about grass than any human being." The visit was framed as an effort to highlight reduced crime rates since the administration deployed National Guard troops and federal agents throughout the capital.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retail giant raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust top-line growth and margin expansion even while absorbing the impact of tariffs. Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss driven by non-systemic expenses like restructuring costs. He believes the company is "hitting it on all cylinders" and that its ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices remains a key advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to reverse a six-year sales decline for the Jeep brand, parent company Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee. The new model marks the debut of Stellantis' first hybrid powertrain in North America, a 1.6-liter turbo-four engine, aiming to be more competitive in the midsize SUV segment. The Cherokee, which was previously discontinued in 2023 as a cost-cutting measure, returns with a larger frame, more cargo space, and a technology-focused interior. This relaunch is a key part of the strategy to reinvigorate the iconic brand and regain lost market share.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The international race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound, is intensifying, with China and Russia currently ahead of the West. These weapons are a significant strategic threat because their extreme speed and in-flight maneuverability make them incredibly difficult to detect, track, and intercept with existing defense systems. While the U.S. and UK are now investing heavily to catch up, they are seen as lagging after years of focusing on counter-terrorism rather than peer-state competition. The proliferation of this technology is also raising global security concerns.</p>
