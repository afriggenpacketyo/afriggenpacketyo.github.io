            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary halt to the deportation of Venezuelan detainees held in North Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law. This action came after the ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to deport the detainees without allowing them the opportunity to challenge their removal in court. The ACLU lawsuit alleges that the detainees, accused of being gang members, were given notices in English despite speaking only Spanish, and were not informed of their right to contest their designation in federal court.</p>

            <p>Despite U.S. reluctance to support a large-scale attack, Israel is reportedly considering a limited military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities in the coming months. This action stems from Israel's determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. While such a strike would be smaller than initially proposed, it could still set back Iran's nuclear program. The decision remains uncertain, particularly with ongoing nuclear talks, and could strain U.S.-Israel relations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Economists warn that Donald Trump's escalating trade war, characterized by tariffs on imports, could lead to higher prices for American consumers. This expectation of rising prices may incentivize companies to increase profits by raising prices, even on goods not directly affected by tariffs. Senator Elizabeth Warren cautioned against corporations using tariffs as an excuse for price-gouging. A study on Trump's previous tariffs on washing machines found that prices of domestic machines also rose, indicating a broader inflationary effect. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused under a wartime law of being foreign gang members, responding to concerns raised by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that the men were at risk of imminent removal to an El Salvadoran prison without due process. The court's order directs the Trump administration not to remove any member of the group until further notice, highlighting the ongoing legal battle over the administration's deportation policies.</p>
