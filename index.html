          <p>President Trump announced that Fox News host Jeanine Pirro would replace Ed Martin as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after Martin's nomination faced Senate opposition. Pirro, a former judge and district attorney, has been a vocal supporter of Trump and defended him during various investigations. Her appointment resolves a dilemma for the president, who needed a successor before Martin's term expired on May 20. Pirro's history includes repeating false statements about voter fraud in the 2020 election, which was part of a lawsuit against Fox News, but she also has a long-standing relationship with Trump and has been a staunch defender of his political career.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing increasing pressure to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts, with former All-Star Jane Adams calling the enforced skort rule "sexism." County and club teams have been advocating for the change, citing discomfort and player welfare concerns, with a recent survey showing that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts. The Camogie Association has scheduled a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, however Elen McIntosh, captain of Ballycastle's senior camogie team, believes there are bigger issues facing women's sports, such as access to facilities, funding and media coverage. Some players have even threatened to forfeit matches if forced to wear skorts.</p>

          <p>A January 29 order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth led to canceled classes, book bans and an argument about American greatness. West Point is under scrutiny following Defense Secretary Hegseth's directive to remove ideologies deemed "divisive" from the curriculum, leading to the cancellation of classes, book bans, and faculty resignations. This article highlights how West Point leaders initiated a schoolwide push to remove any readings that focused on race, gender or the darker moments of American history. Two classes were scrapped midsemester for noncompliance, and works by Black authors were purged, sparking debate over academic freedom and political influence at the military academy.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is planning significant cuts to balance its budget, potentially affecting services such as diabetes care, rehab centers, and talking therapies. NHS Providers, representing health managers, warns of staff reductions, including doctors and nurses, with some trusts halting overtime for doctors, which could impact waiting list reduction efforts. Despite increased government funding, initial accounts suggest a nearly £7 billion overspend, leading to concerns about morale and service quality. Some mental health trusts have already stopped accepting referrals for certain conditions, and the closure of maternity units is being considered due to falling birth rates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump appointed Fox News host and former prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. The selection follows the withdrawal of Ed Martin, the current interim prosecutor, due to a lack of Republican support in the Senate. Pirro, a long-time ally of Trump, has a history of defending him, including during the "Access Hollywood" tape scandal. She also faced scrutiny for pushing false allegations of election fraud after Trump's 2020 election loss. One of Trump's final acts before leaving office in 2021 was issuing a last-minute pardon to Pirro's ex-husband.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon will immediately begin moving as many as 1,000 service members who identify as transgender out of the military and give others 30 days to self-identify, under a new directive issued on Thursday. The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who issued the latest memo, made his views clear after the court’s decision. Buoyed by Tuesday’s supreme court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on transgender individuals in the military, the defense department will then begin going through medical records to identify others who have not come forward. Those troops would then be involuntarily forced out of the service.</p>

The deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than representing a deep and broad free trade agreement. Sir Keir Starmer acknowledges that the trading conditions may not be better than they were six months ago but argues that the focus should be on the very recent past. The agreement avoids issues like the NHS and food standards but leaves a 10% tariff in place on most UK products.</p>

The author argues that emphasizing individual judges rather than the law itself shifts the focus away from a government of laws and toward a government of individuals. This trend is particularly concerning given President Trump's attacks on judges who rule against his policies, which delegitimizes the court system. The author suggests that while scrutiny of judges is important, the focus should remain on the law and the integrity of the legal process.</p>
