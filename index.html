          <p>The Trump administration will pay nearly $5 million to settle a lawsuit from the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the January 6th Capitol riot. The settlement resolves a $30 million suit alleging negligence by the Capitol Police officer who shot her, Lt. Michael Byrd. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed disagreement with the settlement, stating it sends a chilling message to law enforcement. Trump has repeatedly supported the rioters and described Babbitt as a "really good person."</p>

          <p>Divisions persist among House Republicans over a proposal to raise taxes on high-income earners to fund higher deduction caps for state and local taxes (SALT). Representative Nick LaLota suggested increasing the top tax bracket to 39.6% to generate $300 billion, but conservative Republicans oppose the idea. They argue that higher taxes on the wealthy harm the economy and incentivize high-tax policies in blue states. House GOP leadership aides indicated that such a tax hike would not be included in the final bill.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulent trading, with U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar initially sliding before recovering. Market jitters were fueled by a bill in Congress that would make President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, citing fiscal deficit and growing debt costs, also contributed to market anxiety. Investors sought refuge in gold, while analysts raised forecasts for U.S. yields due to the pause on tariffs bolstering economic growth and inflation.</p>

          <p>A new study projects that extreme weather linked to climate change could significantly increase foreclosures and lender losses in the U.S. Foreclosures caused by weather-related incidents could surge 380% over the next decade, with low- to moderate-income households being particularly vulnerable. Lenders could lose billions annually as they absorb mortgage defaults. The study highlights the "hidden risks" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, such as rising insurance premiums.</p>

Judge Beryl Howell ordered the reinstatement of the unlawfully fired USIP president and board members, and declared the transfers of the institute's assets null and void. Howell stated that Trump's actions represented a gross usurpation of power. The case revolved around whether USIP is part of the federal government and, if so, whether it's part of the executive branch.</p>
