          <p>Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, is under army patrol following widespread, deadly protests against corruption and nepotism that led to the prime minister's resignation. Gen Z groups, who initiated the demonstrations, have distanced themselves from the escalating violence, arson, and vandalism, claiming their peaceful movement was "hijacked" by opportunists. With 29 reported deaths since Monday, authorities have imposed curfews and initiated peace talks with student leaders, who are now consolidating new demands. Despite the destruction, some Nepalis express hope that these events will lead to significant political change and improved governance for the country's future.</p>

          <p>Dr. Peter Hotez, a prominent vaccine scientist and author, discusses his deeply personal battle against the escalating anti-science movement. His new book, "Science Under Siege," co-authored with climate scientist Michael E. Mann, examines the forces driving disinformation from fossil fuel interests to social media influencers. Hotez recounts facing public ridicule and personal attacks, including threats and religious slurs, particularly after his involvement in developing a low-cost COVID-19 vaccine and his refusal to debate a vaccine skeptic. He expresses profound concern that this hostile environment will discourage young people from entering scientific fields, underscoring the critical need to understand and strategically combat these existential threats to public health and reason.</p>

          <p>Three individuals, potentially including two children, tragically died overnight off the coast of Calais during an attempt to cross the English Channel. French authorities stated the victims were likely crushed at the bottom of an overcrowded boat, with officials attributing the deaths to ruthless smuggling gangs. This incident contributes to a grim toll of over 20 lives lost in the Channel this year, highlighting the escalating dangers faced by migrants. The UK government is under immense pressure as more than 50,000 people have crossed since July 2024, prompting the new Home Secretary to prioritize border protection and explore all options to address the chaotic immigration system.</p>

          <h2>EU Considers Tighter Sanctions on Russia, Explores Secondary Measures Against Third Countries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 07:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is planning to intensify sanctions against Russia, with Ursula von der Leyen stating a focus on phasing out Russian fossil fuels faster and targeting the "shadow fleet." Diplomatic sources indicate discussions are underway regarding the implementation of secondary sanctions against companies in third countries, like China, that circumvent existing measures. This move, while aimed at pressuring Moscow over the war in Ukraine, could significantly strain the EU's relations with Beijing and challenge global trading regulations. The EU seeks to maintain strong ties with the US while navigating these complex geopolitical and economic challenges.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Trump Administration's Extensive Use of Private Flights for Immigrant Deportations and Transfers</h2>

          <p>A Guardian investigation, based on leaked flight records, exposes the Trump administration's "purgatory" system for immigrants, involving extensive and often disorienting transfers via charter flights. Over 44,000 immigrants, including nearly 1,000 children, were repeatedly moved between detention facilities, often without notice or access to legal counsel, raising concerns about due process violations. The private airline GlobalX, earning most revenue from ICE contracts, has become central to this system, with detainees reporting threats and confusion. Critics argue these chaotic transfers are designed to wear down immigrants and coerce voluntary deportations, reflecting a fundamentally inhumane approach.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's 30-day federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police department, initiated to combat violent crime, has instead led to indiscriminate immigrant detentions, racial profiling, and numerous arrests for minor offenses. Despite the administration's claims of reduced violent crime, residents report a climate of fear and distrust, with federal agents from multiple agencies conducting tactics like checkpoints and stop-and-frisks. Critics, including the ACLU, argue these actions disproportionately target Black and Brown individuals, undermining constitutional rights and making the city feel unsafe for immigrants. The takeover's tactics are expected to persist, raising concerns about the future of civil liberties in the capital.</p>

          <p>The expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies after 2025 threatens a "huge premium shock" for approximately 22 million Americans. Experts predict average premiums could rise by about 75%, or over $700 annually, if Congress fails to extend the tax credits. These subsidies have been crucial in lowering uninsured rates to historic lows. The Republican-controlled Congress's willingness to extend them remains uncertain, despite a push from some lawmakers to avoid significant cost increases ahead of the 2026 midterms.

          <p>U.S. mortgage application volume experienced a significant 9.2% jump last week, reaching its highest level in three years, spurred by a sharp decline in interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 6.49% from 6.64%, marking the lowest rate since October 2024. This reduction in rates, linked to a weakening labor market, led to increased demand for both home purchases and refinances.

          <p>An Atlantic opinion article critically examines how the legal philosophy of originalism, championed by figures like Justice Antonin Scalia, has contributed to the "death" of constitutional amendment in the U.S. The article argues that originalism, by prioritizing the Framers' original intentions, has made formal constitutional change nearly impossible, pushing political battles into judicial appointments and interpretation. This shift has led to increased polarization, a decline in public trust in the Supreme Court, and a system where fundamental legal principles are undermined. The piece suggests that originalism, once an outsider's game, has become a tool for achieving political ends that could not be won democratically.</p>
