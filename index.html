          <p>McDonald's is introducing a test run of ten new beverages in some of its U.S. restaurants, drawing inspiration from its recently closed spinoff, CosMc's. This move is a direct response to the growing demand for unique and flavorful cold drinks, particularly among Gen Z consumers. The new lineup, which includes items like the Popping Tropic Refresher and Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew, represents a strategic shift to integrate the beverage-focused concept into existing McDonald's locations. The company aims to capitalize on the afternoon snack and refreshment market to boost sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data indicates a significant surge in demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills, as job postings mentioning AI have more than doubled in the past year. According to a Brookings Institution report, this growth reflects an increasing number of companies integrating AI into their operations across various sectors, not just tech. While these roles currently form a small part of the overall labor market, they often command higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar positions without AI requirements. The trend is expanding beyond traditional tech hubs into fields like finance and HR.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's decision, aiming to proceed with canceling hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants. These grants, totaling approximately $783 million, were targeted for their connection to research on diversity, equity, inclusion, and gender identity, which the administration deems contrary to its policy goals. The legal challenge began after 16 states and various research groups sued to block the grant terminations. The administration argues that lower courts are improperly interfering with the executive branch's policy-making authority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The legal action follows an incident where a Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant, intensifying the administration's stance against such policies. Federal officials argue that these local laws obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law and endanger public safety by preventing the arrest of criminals. The lawsuit targets city officials for making it harder for ICE agents to identify and detain undocumented immigrants within the jail system.</p>

          <p>A recent review examines the significant shifts in federal education policy since President Trump took office, highlighting the administration's dual approach of vowing to close the Department of Education while also using its authority to enact major changes. One prominent example is the recent decision to withhold billions of dollars in funding designated for K-12 schools across the country. This article explores the administration's actions and their potential implications for the federal government's role in education and the direct impact on American classrooms. The changes reflect a drastic reorientation of national education priorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a strategic move that allows her to continue serving in the position in an acting capacity. This decision circumvents a federal law that would have prevented her from serving as an acting officer while her nomination was pending before the Senate. The situation arose from a leadership dispute after a federal court appointed a different prosecutor to the role as Habba's initial interim term was expiring. The Justice Department has strongly supported Habba, criticizing the court's intervention.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that investors own 19% of all homes in California, a statistic that underscores the state's deepening housing affordability crisis. While the statewide rate is just below the national average, certain rural and mountain counties see investor ownership rates exceeding 50%. The rise in investor market share is partly attributed to high mortgage rates sidelining traditional homebuyers, allowing investors to fill a liquidity role. However, policy experts argue this trend puts upward pressure on prices, questioning whether it truly helps affordability and raising concerns about a cycle of new housing being acquired by investors.

While the White House frames the policy as a public safety and treatment initiative, critics and advocates for the unhoused argue that such punitive measures exacerbate the crisis.

          <p>Tesla's decision to sell 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022 has proven to be a significant financial misstep, causing the company to miss out on billions in potential profit. The electric vehicle maker sold the majority of its digital assets when the cryptocurrency's value was near its low point. With Bitcoin's price having since surged to near-record highs, the divested portion would now be worth over $3.5 billion. While the company's remaining digital assets still contributed to second-quarter profits, the missed opportunity comes as Tesla faces challenges in its core auto business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stellantis is recalling more than 121,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L vehicles from the 2023-2024 model years due to a safety issue with the second-row headrests. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the headrests may not properly lock into the upright position. This defect could increase the risk of injury to passengers in the event of certain types of crashes. Dealers will inspect the head restraints on affected vehicles and replace them free of charge. Owners are expected to be notified by mail starting in early September.</p>

The negotiations are taking place under an end-of-August deadline set by Western powers, after which previous UN sanctions could be automatically reinstated via a "snapback" mechanism if no agreement is reached. Uncertainty remains about the technical state of Iran's enrichment capabilities following recent attacks. Experts suggest that while Iran may be trying to buy time, the threat of renewed international sanctions provides a strong incentive to engage in diplomacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating the compensation of college athletes, specifically prohibiting "third-party, pay-for-play" deals funded by boosters. The directive addresses the "chaotic environment" created by conflicting state laws on name, image, and likeness (NIL) compensation, which the White House says threatens competitive balance. The order calls for eliminating NIL payments used as recruiting inducements while allowing for fair-market deals. It also directs athletic departments to protect and expand opportunities in women's and non-revenue sports to preserve America's athletic system.</p>

When Ozzy Osbourne's agent was told he was "not relevant" for Lollapalooza, his manager and wife, Sharon Osbourne, created their own festival in response. The first Ozzfest was a two-date event that quickly grew into a juggernaut, running until 2018 and providing a crucial platform for both established and emerging metal bands. The festival became one of Ozzy's most significant legacies, shaping the landscape of heavy music for over two decades.</p>

These cuts are focused on the company's costly foundry division, which has been operating at a loss.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order that temporarily blocks a federal appeals court decision that would have severely limited the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The lower court, the Eighth Circuit, had ruled that private citizens could not bring lawsuits to enforce the law's ban on race discrimination in elections, a move that would have effectively nullified the act in seven states. The Supreme Court's brief order reinstates the ability for private individuals and groups to file such lawsuits, at least for now. Notably, three justices dissented, indicating they would have let the restrictive ruling stand.</p>
