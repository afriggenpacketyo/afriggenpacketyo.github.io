          <p>Saturday's newspapers are largely focused on Reform UK's performance in the local elections and Prince Harry's BBC interview after losing a legal challenge regarding his UK security. The Daily Mail highlights the "Reform revolution" and quotes Prince Harry on his strained relationship with King Charles. The Times also splits its front page between these stories, with Prime Minister Starmer criticizing Farage's "easy solutions." The Financial Times Weekend edition focuses on the local elections, describing Reform UK's victories as a "populist insurgency" and raising concerns about British soldiers' drone training for potential warfare with Russia. The varied perspectives and issues covered provide a comprehensive overview of the day's major news. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The suit argues that these policies obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts, citing concerns about the apartment complex in Aurora allegedly controlled by a Venezuelan gang. Local officials deny Trump's claims of widespread gang control but acknowledge the apartment complex was terrorized. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate city ordinances and state laws that prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities, claiming they violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on car manufacturers. The new tariff, intended to encourage domestic manufacturing, follows a similar tax on imported cars. While companies have been somewhat shielded by a sales surge, General Motors warns of billions in new costs, and Stellantis withdrew financial guidance due to uncertainty. Exemptions for parts made in Mexico and Canada offer some relief, but analysts still anticipate higher costs for businesses and consumers, marking a significant shift in the automotive market.

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has stalled due to economic mismanagement and corruption allegations.

The unbuilt cathedral has become a symbol of economic mismanagement, with critics questioning the use of public money for a personal pledge to God.

          <p>Federal transportation safety officials are investigating an incident where two commercial flights had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to an Army helicopter entering restricted airspace. The incident prompted outrage among officials, including Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who pledged to address the matter with the Defense Department. The FAA had restricted nonessential helicopter traffic around the airport after a fatal collision in January, and lawmakers are renewing concerns about military flights near the airport. The Army stated that the helicopter was following approved flight procedures and that the incident is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Rolando 'Rolly' Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match held in Times Square. Romero knocked down Garcia in the second round and controlled the fight, earning him the WBA's secondary welterweight title. Garcia, returning from a suspension, struggled with timing and output, landing only 54 punches. The loss jeopardizes Garcia's potential rematch with Devin Haney. Haney won his fight, and Lopez also had a strong showing, but the night was highlighted by Romero's victory and Garcia's setback.</p>

This left firefighters relying on smaller tanks that were quickly depleted, leading to reports of dry hydrants. The city's failure to bring either reservoir back online undermined the potential water supply in the area, contributing to the challenges in containing the fire.</p>
