          <p>A 61-year-old man in New York has died after being violently pulled into an active MRI machine by a heavy, 20-pound metal weight-training chain he was wearing around his neck. The man, Keith McAllister, had entered the room to help his wife up from the table after her scan when the machine's powerful magnetic force attracted the chain. He suffered a "medical episode" and died in the hospital a day later, prompting investigations into safety protocols at the clinic.</p>

          <p>China has started building what is set to be the world's largest hydropower dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, a project estimated to cost $170 billion.

However, the project has raised significant concerns in downstream countries like India and Bangladesh, who rely on the river, known there as the Brahmaputra, and fear major impacts on their water supply and regional ecology.</p>

          <p>Analysts from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) are urging China to address "neijuan," a cycle of hyper-competitive, inefficient economic activity, by stimulating domestic demand and fostering innovation. The term describes a situation where companies invest more resources for diminishing returns within a limited market. The analysts argue that expanding the overall market through increased demand and encouraging companies to develop unique, high-value products is essential for breaking this self-defeating cycle and creating healthier, sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>With gold prices rising, affluent investors are increasing their allocation to the precious metal, viewing it as a safe haven amid geopolitical uncertainty and a depreciating U.S. dollar. High-net-worth individuals use various methods, from investing in gold-backed ETFs and unallocated gold vaults to purchasing physical bars for storage, sometimes in highly secure locations like converted Swiss military bunkers. This trend reflects a growing desire among wealthy investors to diversify assets and hedge against economic and political risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations has voiced serious concern regarding the Taliban's recent arrests of numerous women and girls in Afghanistan for allegedly violating the strict dress code. Since regaining power, the Taliban has enforced morality laws requiring women to cover their faces in public, recommending the full burqa. The UN mission stated these arrests contribute to a climate of fear, further isolate women, and erode public trust, urging the Taliban to rescind policies that violate women's fundamental human rights.</p>

The White House suspended the funding, demanding Harvard alter its policies on hiring, admissions, and diversity programs to combat alleged antisemitism. Harvard argues the administration's actions are an unconstitutional infringement on free speech and academic freedom and is seeking a swift judgment to release the critical funds, which support a wide range of research and university operations.</p>

Scientists deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to establish a new reef that will help purify water and boost local biodiversity. The protected status of the wreck, which bans fishing, makes it an ideal location for this effort to restore a keystone species and its vital role in the marine ecosystem.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Chief Justice John Roberts has been instrumental in expanding the power of the U.S. presidency, enabling President Trump's broad use of executive authority. Through key Supreme Court opinions, Roberts has legitimized actions like the "Muslim ban" and has advanced a "unitary executive" theory that concentrates power in the president. This judicial philosophy, the article contends, has reshaped the presidency into a more authoritarian institution, providing a constitutional framework for actions that challenge traditional checks and balances.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's heavy reliance on tariffs as its primary tool for foreign policy and trade leverage, a departure from the use of sanctions by previous governments. Tariffs align with the "America First" agenda, can be implemented unilaterally without congressional approval, and generate revenue, suiting the president's desire for rapid, visible action. However, this approach has created significant uncertainty in global markets and has been used to pressure countries on non-trade issues, blurring the lines between economic policy and punitive sanctions.</p>
