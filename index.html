          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>West Bromwich Albion has dismissed head coach Tony Mowbray following a string of poor results, including a recent defeat to Derby County, which has significantly diminished their chances of securing a Championship play-off spot. Mowbray's second stint with the club lasted only three months, during which the team managed just five wins in 18 games. The club is currently six points outside the play-off positions with only two games remaining, and James Morrison will take over as interim manager. The decision underscores the high stakes and expectations within professional football management.</p>

            <p>Experts are divided on whether mortgage rates will fall below 6% soon, a level that could provide financial relief to potential homebuyers. Some believe it's possible, particularly if inflation continues to cool and the Federal Reserve considers rate cuts later in the year. However, others remain skeptical, citing persistent economic uncertainty and headwinds affecting rates, and Steve Hill caps the odds of mortgage rates dropping to that level this year at 20%. The predictions highlight the ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>George Clooney has responded to Donald Trump's criticism of him as a "fake movie actor," stating that he doesn't care about Trump's opinion. Clooney, who recently published an op-ed urging Joe Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee, emphasized that his job is to tell the truth and that he is prepared to face criticism for his views. Clooney defended his right to criticize political figures, asserting that freedom of speech includes the right to express dissenting opinions. He also said it was his “civic duty” to go against Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election and champion an alternate Democratic nominee.</p>

            <p>A crew researching the USS Yorktown, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier sunk during World War II, discovered a vehicle inside the shipwreck. The discovery was made during an exploration of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The vehicle appears to be a military jeep, resting upright with features like flared fenders, chrome trim, and a spare tire on the back. Researchers are considering theories about why the vehicle was aboard the Yorktown, such as it being Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher's flag car or brought aboard for repairs.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is experiencing the lowest economic approval ratings of his presidency, driven by widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey indicates that the economic optimism that followed Trump's reelection has faded, with more Americans now anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook for the stock market. The results reveal a significant decline in support among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers, highlighting the challenges Trump faces in maintaining economic confidence.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could significantly alter health insurance plans' obligations to cover preventive care services. The case challenges the authority of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which recommends treatments insurers must cover under the Affordable Care Act. The justices are considering whether the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A decision against the task force could limit access to essential medical care for millions, potentially requiring patients to pay out-of-pocket for services currently provided at no cost.</p>

            <p>The "magic number" needed for a comfortable retirement has decreased to $1.26 million, yet Americans are feeling less confident about reaching this goal. Market volatility and economic uncertainty have contributed to sinking retirement confidence, with more than half of Americans expecting to outlive their savings. Workers today are largely on their own when it comes to their retirement security, which has also taken a toll on retirement confidence. The shift toward relying on retirement savings heightens the importance of grounding yourself in a financial plan as early as you can. (not investment advice)</p>
