            <h2>Trump Seeks Trade Deals with Energy Purchases</h2>

            <p>President Trump is pushing trade partners to buy more U.S. energy, specifically $350 billion from the European Union, as a way to avoid higher tariffs and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Trump aims to achieve "energy dominance" by linking trade and energy goals, stating that the U.S. can quickly reduce its trade deficit by having countries purchase its energy. The U.S. is currently the largest oil and gas producer and a major exporter of both crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), with energy representing a significant portion of total U.S. exports. LNG is seen as a key commodity for increasing energy imports from the U.S.</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system used to exempt freight from tariffs has caused confusion and delays for U.S. shippers, particularly those dealing with Chinese goods. The glitch affects the entry code needed for tariff exemptions, preventing the collection of tariffs and raising questions about Customs' ability to manage the rapidly changing tariff policies. Customs is advising importers to file cargo release forms separately from financial papers to keep goods moving, but the situation has created uncertainty and increased paperwork for businesses already struggling with tariff changes. Some companies are pausing expansion plans due to the unpredictable trade environment.</p>

            <p>European allies have pledged €21 billion in fresh military support to Kyiv, describing it as "a critical year" for the war, with Germany contributing more than half of the total aid (€11 billion over four years). The aid package includes air defenses, missiles, artillery ammunition, infantry fighting vehicles, battle tanks, ground surveillance radars, and Man-Portable Air Defense Systems. This commitment comes as Europe seeks to address the gap left by shifting U.S. priorities and despite Trump's promise of a ceasefire. The support aims to bolster Ukraine's military strength and facilitate a path towards a just and lasting peace.</p>

            <p>Climate change is exacerbating insect allergies, as warmer temperatures and disrupted weather patterns allow stinging and biting insects to thrive in new areas and in greater numbers. Insect allergies, though less common than pollen allergies, can cause severe and deadly reactions, and are often understudied and underdiagnosed. The rise in insect populations is leading to more people experiencing allergic reactions for the first time, with many doctors lacking sufficient knowledge on how to treat them. This poses a growing public health concern, particularly as insects like fire ants and ticks expand their range.</p>

            <p>The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has described Gaza as "hell on earth" amid the ongoing Israeli military assault, with over 1,500 reported deaths and nearly 400,000 displaced since fighting resumed last month. The ICRC chief, Mirjana Spoljaric, stated that what is happening in Gaza is an "extreme hollowing out" of international law, with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict. She appealed for a renewal of the ceasefire and warned of a growing "dehumanisation" during war, in which the international community is turning away despite clear war crimes being committed.</p>

            <p>U.S. companies are responding to President Trump's tariffs by implementing "tariff surcharges" and raising prices on goods. Some businesses, such as Labucq and Dame, are explicitly adding tariff-related fees to customer purchases to cover the increased costs. While some consumers are stocking up on goods in anticipation of higher prices, other companies are using the situation as a promotional opportunity by offering "pre-tariff sales." The uncertainty surrounding tariffs is causing consumers to overestimate potential losses and engage in panic-buying.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield topped 4.5% after a significant surge this week, causing concern on Wall Street and within the White House. President Trump's trade policies have contributed to this rise, prompting investors to move away from U.S. assets. The increase in yields has complicated the White House's approach to trade, as it may pressure them to pause or reconsider certain tariff measures. The bond market's reaction has likely struck a nerve with the Trump administration, which has emphasized its focus on low financing costs.</p>
