            <p>Several statues in London's Parliament Square, including one of women's suffrage campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett, were vandalized during a transgender rights protest. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incidents as criminal damage after transgender campaigners gathered to protest a Supreme Court ruling defining biological sex for the Equality Act. Graffiti, including "trans rights are human rights," was found on a statue of former South African prime minister Jan Smuts. Police are reviewing complaints about signs and images displayed during the protest and will take action if laws were broken.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project, a massive natural gas initiative, to navigate trade demands from President Trump and avoid tariffs. The project, involving an 800-mile pipeline, gas processing plant, and liquefaction plant, aims to export LNG to Asia. Trump is touting the project as a national priority, and Secretary Bessent has suggested it could play a role in trade negotiations, potentially reducing the US trade deficit. The project aims to produce 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, with construction expected to begin in late 2026 and operations starting in 2031.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry concluded that the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month resulted from an "operational misunderstanding". The IDF claims troops opened fire believing they faced a threat from enemy forces, blaming poor visibility and a rapid approach of vehicles. The report stated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, but it did not produce evidence for any affiliation to Hamas, despite the names of those killed being in the public domain. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report.</p>

            <p>A fire on a motorized wooden boat in the Democratic Republic of Congo resulted in 33 deaths, a significantly lower figure than the initially reported 148. The incident occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers near Mbandaka, with approximately 400 people believed to be on board. The mayor of Mbandaka attributed the discrepancies in death toll reports to "confusion." Congolese police suspect that cooking onboard the vessel ignited the blaze. Boat accidents are common in Congo due to overcrowding and inadequate safety measures.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, a marketplace for refurbished tech devices, believes that President Trump's tariffs could lead to more Americans opting for used electronics. The company saw sales triple in a week following the tariff announcements, suggesting consumers are concerned about rising prices on new devices. While analysts are mixed on whether this trend will last, the CEO argues that tariffs create a strong incentive for consumers to save money by purchasing refurbished items. Prolonged tariffs could cause a "huge uptick" in short-term sales of used and refurbished devices, especially smartphones.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court's order prevents the Trump administration from removing Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center, following an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argues that immigration authorities are moving to restart removals under the AEA, which the Trump administration invoked to detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted hastily.</p>

            <p>An economist argues against relying on commonly cited recession indicators like spending on haircuts or men's underwear sales, stating there's little empirical evidence to support their accuracy. The economist suggests focusing on actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital, and labor, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies. Recent reports from Walmart, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Paychex indicate a healthy economy, but the economist advises closely monitoring future earnings releases for signs of cracks forming. He believes these direct sources offer a more reliable gauge of the economy's direction than surveys or government data.</p>

            <p>A 14-year-old girl was killed by a lion on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya, after being snatched from a residential compound near Nairobi National Park. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is searching for the lion and has implemented additional security measures. This incident follows another where a 54-year-old man was killed by an elephant in Nyeri county. Conservationists are urging KWS to improve risk assessments and communication about wildlife movement, and to equip residential areas near wildlife habitats with deterrent systems.</p>

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens for their alleged actions at protests against Israel's war in Gaza. The Berlin Immigration Office has ordered the individuals to leave Germany by April 21, citing a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024 where "masked individuals" entered a university building and caused "property damage including graffiti." These deportation orders have drawn comparisons with the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S. The individuals are appealing the deportation notice.</p>

            <p>As fears of a potential recession and anxiety over tariff policy weigh on the markets, experts suggest strategies to protect retirement savings. These include rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, building cash reserves to avoid selling investments during market downturns, and considering a "bond ladder" for stable income. The article emphasizes the importance of avoiding selling investments when the stock market is down, especially during the first few years of retirement, due to the risk of shrinking the nest egg early.</p>

            <p>The author recounts a humorous first date lie from 30 years ago, where she claimed to drive a Land Rover despite knowing nothing about cars. The article explores the prevalence of dishonesty in dating, from catfishing to gaslighting, and questions whether all dating lies are necessarily awful. While egregious lies about relationship status or sexual preferences are harmful, the author suggests that lesser lies may stem from insecurity or a desire to present a better self. Ultimately, the author's lie did not deter her date, leading to a long-term relationship.</p>

The DOJ accuses Google of illegally stifling competition by paying browser and phone makers to set Google as the default search engine. The government is calling for Google to stop making third-party payments and to spin off its Chrome web browser and possibly sell its Android smartphone operating system. Google argues that the proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation.</p>

            <p>China's response to the US's "reciprocal tariffs" should not merely involve reciprocal tariff increases, but rather adopt a more strategic approach with a specific aim – requiring bilateral trade be settled in renminbi. This would significantly strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate, challenging the dominance of the US dollar. By mandating the use of the renminbi for US-China trade, the US would be forced to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, pushing up the exchange rate and signaling to global investors that China's economic fundamentals are strong.</p>
