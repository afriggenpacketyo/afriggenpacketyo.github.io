          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new $1.6 billion stake in UnitedHealth, a major health insurer currently facing a Justice Department investigation and public backlash over rising healthcare costs. The investment was built secretly over two quarters, and its disclosure caused the insurer's stock to rise significantly after a prolonged period of sharp decline and management changes. While the position is relatively small for Berkshire's massive portfolio and could be the work of his lieutenants, it signals potential confidence in the beleaguered company's future prospects and ability to navigate its challenges.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan to hold a special election to redraw the state's congressional maps. This move is a direct response to potential mid-decade redistricting efforts by Republican-led states like Texas, which Democrats argue is an attempt to "rig" elections. Newsom stated that California's plan would only proceed if other states move forward with their own changes, framing the initiative as a necessary defense of democracy. Republicans have heavily criticized the action as a self-serving and unconstitutional power grab designed to consolidate Democratic power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is driven by distinct goals for each leader regarding the war in Ukraine. Putin seeks to gain international recognition, sidestep European leaders, and secure territorial concessions, using the meeting to project Russia's status as a global power. Conversely, Trump aims to fulfill his campaign promise of being a peacemaker, potentially seeking a deal that could earn him a Nobel Peace Prize, even as he vacillates between criticizing and accommodating Putin. The meeting's outcome remains highly uncertain, with Ukraine and its allies wary of potential concessions made without their involvement.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump reportedly placed an unsolicited call to Norway's finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, to inquire about a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. According to Norwegian media outlet Dagens Næringsliv, this was not the first time Trump had raised the subject with Stoltenberg. In a statement, Stoltenberg confirmed a call took place ahead of a meeting with the Norwegian prime minister but stated its focus was on tariffs and economic cooperation. The Norwegian Nobel Committee independently selects laureates, and Trump has previously complained about not receiving the prestigious award.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his significant loss in the 2022 election. Prosecutors argued Peña acted on the baseless belief the election was "rigged" and sought to terrorize political opponents into being afraid to participate in public life. No one was injured in the shootings, though in one case bullets entered the bedroom of a state senator's 10-year-old daughter.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court allowed a Mississippi law restricting minors' access to social media to remain in effect, but a concurring opinion from Justice Brett Kavanaugh revealed key insights into the court's process. Kavanaugh suggested the law is likely unconstitutional but voted with the majority because the plaintiffs had not proven "irreparable harm," a standard from the Court's expedited "shadow docket" procedures. This application is notable because the Court has seemingly waived this standard in cases involving the Trump administration. The opinion suggests that for most litigants, the stricter standard remains, while also signaling that the First Amendment is likely safe from further erosion.</p>

          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty have announced the end of their partnership, which placed Ulta beauty shops inside hundreds of Target stores. The "shop-in-shop" concept, launched in 2021, will wind down by August 2026. The deal was intended to drive foot traffic to Target by offering a curated selection of Ulta's popular beauty brands. The termination of the partnership is seen as a setback for Target, which has been struggling with flat sales and declining store traffic, and now faces the challenge of replacing a key growth driver in its beauty category.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors convened a grand jury and attempted to force Del Richardson, the wife of City Councilman Curren Price, to testify in the corruption case against him. Price is facing charges of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest, stemming from allegations that he voted on measures that financially benefited his wife's consulting firm. Richardson, who was described as a "suspect" in a 2022 investigative summary but has not been charged, ultimately did not testify. Price's attorney is now seeking to dismiss the charges, questioning the legality of using a grand jury for discovery in a pending case.</p>

The victims were the parents, uncle, and grandmother of an infant who was found abandoned in a front yard.

          <p>German soccer club Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" branding partnership following significant pressure from fans and human rights activists. The deal was criticized due to Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged support for the M23 rebel group in the DR Congo. Instead of a complete break, the club announced a "strategic evolution" of the relationship, now focusing on a youth soccer academy in Kigali. The move is seen as a public relations climbdown rather than a purely moral decision, as the club recently signed a new deal with another partner with human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, driven largely by major government and military contracts. The company recently surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue, with U.S. government revenue growing 53%, highlighting its deep ties to agencies like the Department of Defense. Despite this success, its market valuation has reached astronomical levels, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants with much larger revenues. This premium valuation reflects immense investor confidence in its AI-powered future, fueled by both institutional and strong retail interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The annual Monterey Car Week auctions are underway, with sales expectations for the classic car market appearing subdued compared to previous years. Total sales are projected to be lower than the 2022 peak, with a notable drop in the number of high-end cars valued over $10 million. Experts attribute the slowdown to a generational shift, as aging baby boomer collectors sell off their 1950s and 1960s vehicles, while younger collectors favor more modern supercars from the 1980s onward. This rotation is causing falling prices for older classics but fueling a boom for newer collectible cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the U.K. have narrowly outperformed girls in achieving the top A-level grades (A* or A). The shift is statistically small but significant, with boys also strengthening their lead at the highest A* grade. Experts suggest the trend may be linked to the rising popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are studied by a higher proportion of boys and tend to award more top grades. While humanities subjects have declined in popularity, more female students overall still entered for A-levels, meaning more girls achieved at least an A grade in absolute numbers.</p>

          <p>In this opinion article, Rebecca Solnit argues that Donald Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C. is an act of profound hypocrisy, initiated under the false pretext of rampant crime. She contrasts this action with the 2021 Capitol attack, which she calls the most violent day in the city's recent history, instigated by Trump himself. Solnit frames the move as part of a broader right-wing war on cities, which are often demonized for their diversity and progressive values. The author contends that the takeover is an authoritarian power grab designed to distract from other issues and impose control over a Democratic stronghold.</p>

          <p>While President Trump's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force has sparked alarm, legal experts suggest such a move would be difficult to replicate in other U.S. cities. The action is possible in D.C. because it is a federal district, not a state, giving the president unique authority under the Home Rule Act. In contrast, the governors of the 50 states command their own National Guard units, and the Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. Any attempt to deploy federal forces in cities like Chicago or Los Angeles would face significant legal and constitutional challenges.</p>
