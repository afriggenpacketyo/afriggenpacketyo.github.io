          <p>The Trump administration has postponed a widespread increase in import tariffs, extending a previous 90-day pause to August 1. However, President Trump has issued letters to 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, specifying new tariff rates that will take effect on that date unless new trade agreements are reached. The move has created uncertainty in financial markets, with economists noting that while the extension provides time for negotiation, the threat of steep levies remains. The administration argues the tariffs protect American industries, but critics warn of higher consumer prices and reduced trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility, over three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home. He and his wife, Yvette, were attacked in what authorities have described as part of a series of "politically motivated" shootings targeting lawmakers. The alleged assailant, who also fatally shot another state representative and her husband on the same night, is now facing multiple murder and attempted murder charges. Hoffman's release from the ICU marks a significant step in his recovery from the violent assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new gene therapy, administered through a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants regaining significant hearing within weeks. The research, detailed in Nature Medicine, involved delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene directly to the inner ear of patients whose hearing loss was caused by a mutation. All ten participants, including children and adults, showed considerable improvement, with one seven-year-old girl recovering almost full hearing. This pioneering treatment is being hailed as a major and safe breakthrough with potential to treat other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that parking lots are the site of one in five vehicle accidents in the United States, resulting in over 500 deaths and 165 injuries per day. The study identifies driver distraction and poor urban design as primary contributors to these incidents, with many drivers admitting to using phones or engaging in other distracting activities while navigating parking areas. In some U.S. cities, parking lots occupy a vast percentage of downtown land, often lacking basic safety features like clear markings and adequate lighting. The report calls for improved design standards and greater driver awareness to mitigate these preventable risks.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto endured the shortest start of his MLB career, collapsing in a five-run first inning against the Milwaukee Brewers. A combination of poor pitches, including a key home run given up to Andrew Vaughn, and a critical defensive error by Mookie Betts led to Yamamoto being pulled after just two outs and 41 pitches. The early deficit proved insurmountable for the shorthanded Dodgers lineup, which was missing several key players due to injury.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to permanently restrict a landlord's ability to evict tenants for the purpose of substantial renovations, a practice known as "renoviction." The new amendment will require landlords to obtain a government agency order, typically issued for safety code violations, before they can legally evict for a remodel. This measure aims to close a loophole that tenant advocates say was used to displace long-term renters in order to charge higher rents to new tenants. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated and compensated during legitimate, necessary renovations.</p>

          <h2>Commentary: Trump Administration's Priorities Criticized as Misplaced Amid National Crises</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary article from the Los Angeles Times argues that the Trump administration's priorities are dangerously misguided, focusing on immigration enforcement while neglecting critical scientific and medical research. The author points to recent events, such as the deployment of federal agents to L.A.'s MacArthur Park, as a "political agenda of provoking fear" that does little to solve real problems. The piece contrasts the billions being spent on border and ICE agents with significant budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health and weather forecasting agencies. It frames this as a willful ignorance of existential threats in favor of a performative show of force.</p>

          <p>The remnants of tropical depression Chantal caused severe flash flooding in North Carolina, leading to the death of an 83-year-old woman whose vehicle was swept away in high waters. The storm system prompted dozens of water rescues and voluntary evacuation notices in several counties as rivers swelled to near-record levels. Chapel Hill was particularly hard-hit, with businesses and apartment buildings inundated by floodwaters. The storm system is now moving northeast over Virginia, with forecasters warning of continued heavy rainfall and a risk of flash flooding across the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to implement a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have resulted in tens of thousands of layoffs in August. The VA stated that a department-wide review, along with staff reductions through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, have made the mass layoffs unnecessary. The agency is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through these other means. The initial plan had drawn criticism from some lawmakers who worried about the potential impact on services for veterans.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has activated another flight path, known as W121, in the sensitive Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, drawing concern from Taiwanese officials. This route is one of three branches off the main M503 flight path, which runs close to the unofficial median line separating mainland China and Taiwan. Beijing stated the move was a technical adjustment to ease air traffic congestion and improve safety for cross-strait flights. However, any unilateral action by Beijing in the strait is viewed by Taipei as a potential security risk and a change to the established status quo.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. The review also found no evidence of a "client list" or credible proof that Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals, debunking widespread conspiracy theories. Investigators confirmed that video footage showed no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death. The memo detailing the findings stated that while Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the cause of justice for them.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner in recognition of his storied career. The selection came as a complete surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. While acknowledging he didn't "deserve" the honor based on his 2025 performance, Kershaw expressed gratitude for the recognition. The pick allows one of the game's most accomplished pitchers to participate in the Midsummer Classic, an event he may not have otherwise qualified for this year.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a $2.2 billion plan to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of such aircraft to modern air defenses and drones in the war in Ukraine. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the country must invest in future-warfare capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. This move reflects a growing reevaluation among global militaries regarding the survivability and cost-effectiveness of traditional attack helicopters in an increasingly complex and lethal battlespace.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not press charges against individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event being officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. This decision comes as a relief to participants who feared fines and organizers who faced potential prison time under Hungary's controversial anti-LGBTQ+ laws. The parade attracted a record crowd in defiance of the government's stance.</p>

          <p>The chief inspector of prisons has issued a stark warning that an overwhelming flow of illegal drugs is "destabilizing" the prison system in England and Wales. According to the annual report, criminal gangs are using methods like drones to smuggle contraband to inmates, fueling criminality and hindering rehabilitation efforts. The report links the problem to overcrowding, staff shortages, and a lack of purposeful activities for prisoners, which leads many to turn to drugs out of boredom. The watchdog called the situation a threat to national security that requires urgent attention at the highest levels of government.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order responds to a lawsuit filed by the organization, which argued that a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" unconstitutionally targets them. The provision aims to block federal Medicaid funds for one year to providers that also offer abortion services, even though federal funds are already prohibited from being used for abortions. The judge's 14-day order ensures that funding continues while the court considers the case further, marking an initial victory for the reproductive health provider.</p>
