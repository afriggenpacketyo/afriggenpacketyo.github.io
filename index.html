        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister Taku Eto after Eto made a remark about having so much gifted rice that he could sell it, which was perceived as insensitive given rising rice prices. The move comes amid already low public support for Ishiba following slush fund scandals within the ruling party. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in an effort to regain public trust ahead of a looming parliamentary election. Political analysts suggest that a poor showing in the election could jeopardize Ishiba's premiership, as opposition parties are eager to capitalize on the misstep.</p>

The communique omitted the group's usual promotion of free trade, reflecting the Trump administration's agenda, but Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne emphasized the G7's unity in purpose and action.

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices and reduced government utility subsidies, marking the highest level in over two years.

Rice prices have doubled over the past year, prompting Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to pledge to lower them.

          <p>Evidence presented by Donald Trump regarding alleged mass killings of white South Africans included images from the Democratic Republic of Congo and falsely portrayed footage as depicting burial sites. The White House claimed the material showed evidence of genocide of white farmers in South Africa, a conspiracy theory circulating among the far-right. A video played by Trump contained several falsehoods and inaccuracies, but was intended to back the president's offer of 'refuge' to persecuted white farmers. The South African government disputes the allegations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration escalated its conflict with Harvard by halting the university's ability to enroll international students and ordering existing students to transfer or lose their legal status. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist party. The administration previously terminated $450 million in grants to the university in May, following an earlier cancellation of $2.2 billion in federal funding. Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in response to the federal cuts.</p>
