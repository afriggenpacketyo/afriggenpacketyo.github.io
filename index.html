          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malaysia during a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This meeting represents one of the most significant diplomatic engagements between the two nations since President Trump's second term began. Tensions remain high over issues including trade, Taiwan's sovereignty, and China's support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, all of which are expected to be key topics of discussion. The dialogue aims to navigate these complex challenges amid a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical friction.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to begin on August 1st. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the administration cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and its retaliatory tariffs on American products as the primary reasons for the move. This represents a significant escalation from the previous 25% tariffs and creates further uncertainty for one of America's largest trading partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As China prepares to release its first-half economic data, analysts are closely watching to see if the figures will necessitate greater fiscal stimulus from Beijing. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the government's 5% target, there are underlying concerns about weak domestic demand and employment. Economists argue that stronger government support is needed to counteract the economic pressures and external uncertainties created by ongoing trade disputes, particularly with the United States.

          <p>The White House is forcefully defending the effectiveness of its recent B-2 bomber raid on Iranian nuclear facilities, codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer. This defense comes in response to a New York Times report, citing Israeli officials, which suggests that a portion of Iran's enriched uranium survived the attack at an underground location. Despite these claims, the Trump administration maintains its official position that the strikes successfully and completely obliterated the targeted sites, thereby enhancing global security.</p>

          <p>The iconic red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are turning once again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds. The restoration of the world-famous landmark in the Montmartre district was celebrated with a street performance of the can-can by 60 dancers and a fireworks display. The cabaret, a symbol of Parisian nightlife since 1889, attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year and its return to form marks a joyful cultural moment.</p>

          <p>Taeil, a former singer from the popular K-Pop group NCT, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by a Seoul court. The sentence comes after he pleaded guilty to the sexual assault of an intoxicated woman in 2024. The court also ordered Taeil and two other men involved in the assault to complete a 40-hour sexual violence treatment program. The criminal case led to his departure from the group in August 2024.</p>

          <p>A new book by strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe analyzes thousands of campaign messages to reveal a formula for effective political slogans, identifying eight key words like 'people,' 'change,' and 'together' that consistently resonate with voters. The article explores the power of memorable slogans such as "Get Brexit Done" and "Make America Great Again," which can define a campaign and capture a specific political moment. It also looks toward the future, where AI and neuroscience are increasingly being used to tailor political messaging to individual voters.</p>

He argues that the internet and artificial intelligence are creating a "post-culture society" and a form of "natural stupidity" by thinking for us. Welsh also reflected on the political and economic shifts since his original novel, suggesting that widespread precarity has changed the class system and left people desperate for change.</p>

The findings indicate that the most extreme and longest-lasting heat waves are intensifying the fastest, which will have increasingly severe impacts on public health, agriculture, and infrastructure. This non-linear effect means that even small increments of global warming will lead to disproportionately larger increases in heat wave risk, underscoring the urgent need for adaptation.</p>
