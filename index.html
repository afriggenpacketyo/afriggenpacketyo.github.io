          <p>Employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have shared their experiences from a recent shooting incident where a gunman fired nearly 200 shots at the campus. Workers, speaking anonymously, described harrowing moments of sheltering in place and expressed frustration with the agency's leadership and communication following the attack. The gunman, who was reportedly motivated by anti-vaccine sentiments, died by suicide during the event, which also resulted in the death of a responding police officer. The employees are now calling for enhanced security measures, including armed guards and bulletproof glass, to prevent future tragedies.</p>

This move mirrors a similar offer from competitor OpenAI and highlights the intense competition among AI firms to secure government contracts and deepen ties with policymakers. The U.S. General Services Administration will facilitate the partnership, which includes technical support for implementation. This follows other major government AI initiatives, including a $200 million Department of Defense contract awarded to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI to advance national security capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's choice to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, E. J. Antoni of the Heritage Foundation, recently suggested that the agency should suspend its monthly jobs reports. In an interview just days before his nomination, Antoni questioned the accuracy of the monthly data, which is a crucial indicator for Wall Street and economists, proposing that the BLS publish only its more accurate quarterly data until methodological issues are fixed. This nomination follows Trump's abrupt firing of the previous BLS Commissioner, whom he accused of rigging jobs data for political purposes after a report showed slower-than-expected job growth and downward revisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has substantially revised the U.S. government's annual global human rights report, significantly scaling back criticism of allied nations like Israel and El Salvador while increasing condemnation of others like Brazil. The report also eliminates entire sections on topics such as government corruption and the persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals, a move the State Department described as a restructuring to "increase readability." Human rights advocates have accused the administration of gutting the report and abandoning core values, suggesting it signals a willingness to overlook abuses in exchange for political cooperation. The changes follow internal guidance to shorten the reports and align with the administration's foreign policy priorities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly rebuked Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, asserting the bank's predictions that tariffs would harm the U.S. economy were incorrect. In a social media post, Trump claimed foreign entities were absorbing the costs and criticized Solomon for not giving his administration credit, even suggesting he should focus on his former hobby as a DJ instead of running a major financial institution. This attack is the latest in a series targeting corporate leaders. In contrast to Trump's claims, a recent Goldman Sachs analysis stated that U.S. consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs, a figure that could rise significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is deliberating whether to revoke the emergency use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children under five years old. Pfizer confirmed the discussions, stating the potential move is not related to the shot's safety or efficacy but could leave many young children without an available vaccine option. This development is part of a series of changes to U.S. immunization policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic. While Moderna's vaccine is approved for children with high-risk health conditions, a broader revocation would significantly limit preventative options for the general pediatric population.</p>

Years of intense drought have left the reservoir at just 30% capacity, with levels only 184 feet above the "dead pool" point, where water can no longer be released downstream.

D.C.'s attorney general has called the move unlawful, pointing to data showing crime is at a 30-year low.

Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan called the project "groundbreaking," utilizing AI-powered technology to expand the classic 1939 film's frames to fit the venue's massive screen. The experience aims to be fully immersive, featuring 167,000 speakers, haptic seats, and environmental effects like custom scents. Despite the high cost of the project, the company is optimistic that the unique attraction will be a significant draw for Las Vegas visitors.</p>

          <p>An ice dam at Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier has begun to release a massive basin of rainwater and snowmelt, prompting evacuation orders for some residents of Juneau. Officials are warning of a potential record surge of floodwater downstream, with the Mendenhall River expected to crest at a new record high. This glacial outburst flooding has become an annual event, with floods in recent years destroying homes and causing widespread damage. In response, government agencies installed a temporary levee this year to protect over 460 properties, though the long-term threat is expected to persist for decades as the glacier continues to retreat.</p>

          <p>Paraguayan officials are proposing a new law to allow local companies to assemble electronic and digital goods using imported parts, primarily from China. The plan, presented to the Senate, aims to create jobs and cut costs by shifting from importing fully assembled products to local manufacturing, with items branded as "Made in Paraguay." This initiative comes as Paraguay debates its diplomatic ties with Taiwan versus China and seeks to capitalize on global trade frictions, such as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Officials believe the policy could make Paraguay an attractive hub for assembly services, similar to its successful domestic motorcycle assembly industry.</p>

The move follows a presidential order from March and will scrutinize everything from exhibition text and artist grants to internal curatorial processes.

          <p>American sprint star Fred Kerley, a multiple Olympic and world championship medalist, is facing a potential two-year ban after receiving a provisional suspension from the Athletics Integrity Unit. The suspension was issued due to three "whereabouts failures," which means he missed three doping tests within a 12-month period. Kerley, who won the 100m world title in 2022, has announced he will challenge the suspension. His lawyer stated that Kerley believes at least one of the missed tests should be set aside, arguing he was not negligent or that the doping control officer failed to make a reasonable effort to locate him.</p>

          <p>A recent article explores whether reverse mortgages are a safe financial option for seniors seeking to supplement their retirement income by tapping into home equity. While most reverse mortgages are federally regulated and insured, providing protections like ensuring the loan balance never exceeds the home's value, they are not without risks. The safety of such a loan depends on the homeowner's long-term plans, as upfront costs can be high. Borrowers must also continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance to avoid default, and the growing loan balance can significantly deplete the equity available to heirs.
