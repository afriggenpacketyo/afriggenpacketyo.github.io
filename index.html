          <p>Governors and state leaders across the United States are expressing concerns over potential budget cuts from the Trump administration, which could significantly impact state-funded public services. With the national debt exceeding $36 trillion, Republicans are pushing for states to assume more financial responsibility, while President Trump aims to offset tax cuts through federal program reductions. Proposed cuts target areas such as infrastructure, education, health, and housing, potentially leaving states unable to cover essential services and forcing difficult decisions. Some states are already warning of budget disruptions due to federal uncertainty, including spending cuts and global tariffs.</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals of extreme food shortage warnings, an internal Israeli analysis reveals that Palestinians in Gaza face widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are quickly restored. Israeli military officials monitoring humanitarian conditions have warned commanders that many areas will run out of food to meet minimum daily nutritional needs if the blockade is not lifted. The analysis highlights a discrepancy between Israelâ€™s public stance and private deliberations, aligning with aid groups' warnings of an impending famine. This comes as Israel plans to expand its military operations in Gaza, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation, where bakeries are shut, charity kitchens are closing, and food stocks are depleted.</p>

          <p>Inflation retreated in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples such as groceries and gasoline, with the consumer price index rising 2.3% annually, the smallest increase since February 2021. Economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, potentially impacting the May CPI report. Current tariff policies could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800 in the short run, with a 10% average tariff rate potentially adding 1 percentage point to the consumer price index.

          <p>Left-wing influencer and political commentator Hasan Piker claimed he was detained for hours by U.S. border officials and interrogated about his political views upon returning from a family trip to France. Piker, known for his criticism of Israel, said officials questioned him about his views on Trump and his potential contact with militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson denied that Piker's political beliefs triggered the inspection, but civil liberties organizations expressed concern over the alleged abuse of power and infringement on press freedom.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist recommends meditation as a tool for managing stage fright, suggesting that it can help individuals become aware of a part of themselves that remains untouched by anxiety. The columnist, who personally experienced a childhood stammer, advises readers to reach for this "bright splinter of untouchability" when anxiety arises, allowing them to observe their experience without being consumed by it. By watching themselves go through the anxiety, individuals can eventually detach from it and find relief.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed two lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's policy of denying transportation grants to states that do not align with its immigration enforcement policies. The lawsuits argue that imposing these conditions exceeds the administrationâ€™s legal authority. California receives over $15.7 billion in transportation grants and $20.6 billion in homeland security grants annually, which could be jeopardized by the policy. Bonta argues that the President is unlawfully coercing state and local governments into using their resources for federal immigration enforcement.</p>

Tesla's car sales have declined, partly due to Musk's political activities, and the company's quarterly profit has fallen to a four-year low.

          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that crime-free housing laws in Illinois are being used to evict families for minor infractions, regardless of convictions. The report found over 2,000 enforcement incidents from 2019 to 2024, with nearly 500 leading to eviction orders. These ordinances, intended to clear out criminals, have resulted in evictions for shoplifting, driving while intoxicated, and even being victims of crime. Critics argue the laws disproportionately impact low-income residents and people of color, prompting efforts to reform the system.</p>
