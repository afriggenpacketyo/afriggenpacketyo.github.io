        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has permitted Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays to reduce operational costs amid declining letter volumes. First-class mail will continue to be delivered six days a week, but second-class items will now arrive on a rotating three-day or two-day weekly schedule. While Royal Mail welcomed the reform for financial sustainability, consumer groups criticized the move, citing the company's existing failures to meet delivery targets and arguing it will not improve service reliability for customers. The changes also include slightly relaxed delivery targets for both first and second-class mail.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with African leaders, former U.S. President Donald Trump complimented Liberian President Joseph Boakai on his command of English, asking where he was educated. Boakai responded that he learned in Liberia, where English has been the official language since the nation's founding in the 19th century by freed Black Americans. The exchange drew attention due to the historical context of Liberia and past accusations that Trump has made insensitive remarks regarding African nations. The article notes that English is spoken fluently by many Liberians alongside multiple Indigenous languages.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels attacked and sank the Greek-operated cargo ship Eternity C in the Red Sea, resulting in at least three crew deaths and the kidnapping of several survivors. This marks the second vessel sunk by the group in a week, escalating tensions and threats to international shipping. The Houthis claim they target ships linked to Israel, the US, or the UK in solidarity with Palestinians, though this vessel had a multinational crew. The attack has been condemned by the US and the EU's naval mission, which is conducting search and rescue operations for the remaining crew.</p>

          <p>A police investigation has been launched into historical sexual assault allegations involving a recently convicted former bishop and another ex-vicar from the Church in Wales. A BBC investigation revealed that concerns about former Bishop Anthony Pierce were reported to church officials as early as 1986, years before his promotion, but were allegedly ignored. Victims are now calling for an independent inquiry, stating the church fostered a culture that protected predators and failed to act on serious abuse claims. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings and promised a review of its culture and safeguarding procedures.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily, a mouthpiece for China's military, has called for thorough ethical and legal research into the use of humanoid robots in combat. The analysis highlighted the potential for "moral pitfalls" and noted that militarized robots would inherently violate Isaac Asimov's first law of robotics, which prohibits harming humans. The authors suggested that any military robots must be programmed to adhere to the laws of war, including principles of obeying, respecting, and protecting humans. This reflects growing global concerns about the weaponization of advanced artificial intelligence and autonomous systems.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents without pay for their involvement in the security failures during the July 2024 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.

The agency's deputy director acknowledged the event as a significant "operational failure" and stated they are focused on fixing the root causes.

In exchange, Britain would accept the same number of asylum seekers from France who have a legitimate claim to be in the UK, such as family connections. While the agreement marks a diplomatic step forward, critics argue the small scale of the pilot will not be a sufficient deterrent to stop the dangerous crossings.</p>

Yoon faces a range of charges including rebellion, abuse of power, and obstructing official duties, which could carry a life sentence. His new arrest could lead to an extended period of detention as a special prosecutor pursues additional indictments against the former leader, who was impeached and formally removed from office.</p>

The trunk is now the centerpiece of an exhibition at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre, located near where the beloved tree once stood on Hadrian's Wall. The display, designed after public consultation, allows visitors to touch and even hug the trunk. It is surrounded by benches inscribed with messages of sorrow and hope submitted by the public, creating a space for reflection on the tree's cultural significance and its mindless destruction.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Poorest Nations Paying Millions to Trump-Linked Lobbyists for US Aid</h2>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness has found that some of the world's poorest countries, including Somalia and Haiti, are paying millions to lobbying firms with close ties to Donald Trump. These countries, many of which were high recipients of USAID, are reportedly signing deals to secure continued U.S. support or military assistance as traditional foreign aid is cut. The report reveals that some nations are bartering access to crucial natural resources like lithium and cobalt in exchange for favorable relations with Washington. This creates a dynamic where desperate countries may enter exploitative deals, trading long-term resources for short-term political favor.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister knighted by Boris Johnson, has defected to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. His departure marks a significant blow to the Conservatives and signals Reform's growing momentum, following several other recent defections from former Tory MPs. In a scathing statement, Berry claimed that two decades of Labour and Tory rule have been deliberately wrecking the country. The move is also forcing a strategic shift from the Labour government, which is reportedly now turning its focus toward countering the rising threat from Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced spot checks at its border with Germany, mirroring a German policy enacted last year and further straining the principle of free movement within the Schengen Area. The move, a response to Germany's tougher migration policies, is causing significant disruption for residents of border cities like Slubice and Frankfurt an der Oder. Commuters face delays, and local leaders express concern that top-down political decisions are harming the decades of integration built between the two communities. The situation is further complicated by the presence of self-proclaimed "citizen patrols" monitoring the border.</p>

          <p>Suffolk Police are facing questions over how a wanted man, Roy Barclay, was able to evade capture for two years and murder 57-year-old Anita Rose during her morning dog walk. Barclay, who was wanted for breaching his prison license conditions after a previous violent assault, had left a significant digital trail, including using his bank card and posting hundreds of reviews on Google Maps. Despite this online activity, he remained at large, living in makeshift camps until he was arrested by chance three months after the murder. Suffolk Police has confirmed a partnership review will investigate the handling of the search.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat persistent youth unemployment, the Chinese government has announced a new subsidy for companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Employers who provide formal contracts and pay social insurance contributions for at least three months will be eligible for a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. The measure is part of a broader push to stabilize the labor market amid sluggish economic growth and intense domestic competition. Additionally, China's economic planner is allocating 10 billion yuan to expand a "work-for-relief" public works program. (not investment advice)</p>
