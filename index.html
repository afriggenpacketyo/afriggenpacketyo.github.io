          <p>Amazon has terminated Ahmed Shahrour, a Palestinian software engineer, following his suspension last month for protesting the company's $1.2 billion Project Nimbus contract with the Israeli government and military. Amazon stated Shahrour violated company standards by posting non-work-related messages regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, which he contends is a collaboration in "genocide in Gaza." Shahrour views his firing as a retaliatory act designed to suppress dissent from Palestinian voices within the company. This event highlights a growing trend across the tech industry, where employees are increasingly vocal in their criticism of business ties to the Israeli military, leading to similar actions at other major tech firms like Microsoft and Google.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully conducted its 11th test flight of the colossal Starship rocket from its Starbase facility in southern Texas, with objectives including a near-global trajectory and the deployment of mock satellites. The booster performed a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico, while the spacecraft skimmed space before its planned descent toward the Indian Ocean, without recovery. This test incorporated additional maneuvering for the spacecraft, building on previous successful flights after initial explosive failures. The Starship is crucial for Elon Musk's long-term goal of sending humans to Mars and is essential for NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside over 20 world leaders, attended a summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign a declaration aimed at cementing a Gaza ceasefire agreement. The "Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity" outlined broad commitments for regional stability, though Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was notably absent due to a Jewish holiday. The summit followed the release of the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages by Hamas and Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners, marking a significant step in the peace process. Trump declared a "new dawn in the Middle East" and emphasized the start of Gaza's rebuilding phase, also urging Iran to engage in peace talks.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office has once again ruled the controversial death of 27-year-old schoolteacher Ellen Greenberg a suicide, despite her having sustained 20 stab wounds and a knife protruding from her chest. Greenberg was found dead in her locked apartment in 2011. Her family's attorney, Joseph Podraza Jr., criticized the new report as "deeply flawed," citing ignored evidence such as a spinal column stab wound, lack of forced entry, and alleged missing surveillance footage. The family settled lawsuits in February 2025 to prompt a reevaluation, but continues to contest the suicide finding, advocating for a homicide or undetermined ruling.</p>

This legislation, which imposes a $150 fine for a first offense, was a direct result of advocacy by Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was tragically killed by a distracted driver in 2019. Distracted driving is a significant public safety concern, causing an average of nine deaths daily in the U.S. Telematics data suggests its involvement in one-third of fatal crashes, a figure higher than traditional police reports.

Prosecutors portrayed Adelson as the controlling orchestrator of the plot, which stemmed from a bitter custody battle, marking her as the fifth person sentenced in the captivating decade-long case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law, Senate Bill 495, significantly easing the process for fire victims to claim personal property losses. Survivors whose residences were totally destroyed can now receive up to 60% of their personal property coverage, capped at $350,000, without needing to submit an itemized list. The law also extends the claim filing period to at least 100 days. This legislation, effective in January, addresses "difficult inefficiencies" in the insurance system exposed by recent catastrophic fires. Newsom also signed a bill to fund the nation's first public wildfire catastrophe model, aiming for greater transparency in risk assessment.</p>

          <p>Cameron McGerr, a 16-year-old from Scotland, is campaigning for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after losing both parents to heart conditions. He believes that if he had known CPR, he might have saved his father, who died from cardiac arrest. Cameron recounted losing crucial minutes in panic, which significantly reduced his father's survival chances. His "Pulse of Life" campaign has already led to CPR training at his own school and has gained attention from MSPs, with the Education Secretary offering a meeting. The article emphasizes the potential to improve survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests if more people are equipped with these life-saving skills.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans, particularly working-class families, face potential spikes in healthcare costs if Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) premium tax credits expire at year-end. These federal subsidies, expanded during the pandemic, have been a "lifeline" for many, saving hundreds of dollars monthly. Democrats are tying government reopening to their renewal, while some Republicans also express support due to constituent impact. Health policy experts warn that without extension, millions could lose insurance, especially in conservative states that haven't expanded Medicaid. The article highlights the urgency, as insurers have already adjusted rates, and the political liability for Republicans if costs rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several prominent U.S. news organizations, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and CNN, have refused to sign new Pentagon policy rules that would restrict journalists from obtaining unauthorized material and require accompaniment by officials in certain areas. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's policy, criticized as undermining First Amendment protections and stifling a free press, also implies that soliciting unapproved information could be criminal. Media outlets argue the public has a right to know how the military operates, especially with a nearly $1 trillion annual budget. The Pentagon, however, maintains the policy is for national security and troop protection.</p>

          <p>Security Minister Jarvis denied claims that National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell made decisions about evidence in the collapsed China spy case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry. Charges were dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) stated evidence couldn't be obtained to label China a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses, as required by case law. Jarvis asserted that Powell was not involved in evidence decisions and blamed antiquated legislation and the previous Conservative government for not classifying China as a threat.

          <p>Former Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira has publicly criticized Democrats, alleging they aim to "erase America’s history" by reexamining Columbus Day, which some regions now observe as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Teixeira, a self-identified lifelong conservative, positions Republicans as the party of "common sense" and champions the celebration of American heritage. This article highlights his recent foray into politics, following his announcement to run for Texas’s 21st Congressional District, where he aligns with President Donald Trump’s "America First agenda." His statements reflect a broader cultural and political debate in the U.S. concerning national holidays, historical narratives, and the perceived "woke" movement.</p>
