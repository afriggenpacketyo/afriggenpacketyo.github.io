          <p>The Baltimore Ravens have released star kicker Justin Tucker, months after reports of sexual misconduct allegations, citing "football reasons" for the decision. The Baltimore Banner reported that more than a dozen massage therapists have accused Tucker of inappropriate behavior, which the NFL is investigating. While Tucker denies the allegations, the Ravens drafted another kicker, Tyler Loop, and noted the decision was based on football, salary cap, and other considerations. The 35-year-old had the worst on-field season of his career in 2024, converting just 73.3% of his field goals.</p>
