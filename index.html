          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly shrank in May, marking its worst drop since September 2022, according to a private survey. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 48.3, below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, signaling a decline in new export orders. The decline in foreign demand accelerated, with new export orders falling to their lowest level since July 2023, and the job market remained grim, with employment shrinking for the second straight month. Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, noted increased uncertainty in the external trade environment, adding to domestic economic headwinds, while major macroeconomic indicators showed a marked weakening at the start of the second quarter.

          <p>Israeli soldiers prevented journalists from visiting Palestinian villages in the West Bank during a tour organized by Oscar winners, citing restrictions in the area. According to Adra, the soldiers aim to conceal the situation from the media and the outside world, especially regarding the violence from settlers since October 7, 2023. Residents have reported increased violence from settlers, and the army regularly demolishes homes and infrastructure, raising fears of expulsion. Journalists were eventually allowed into one village but were barred from others, including Adra's, where settlers had reportedly seized caves and displaced residents. The residents' concerns about the situation in the area are growing with each passing day.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is increasing pressure on California school districts to bar transgender athletes from competing in school sports. Assistant Atty. Gen.

Dhillon demanded districts certify in writing by June 9 that they are no longer complying with the federation's rules.

          <p>The acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), David Richardson, reportedly stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season. The comment confused and dispirited FEMA staff, with some believing Richardson was genuinely surprised by the information. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the comment was a joke, while others suggested it was delivered in poor taste, offending agency staff already suffering from low morale amid a flurry of resignations, firings, leadership overhauls and polygraph tests distributed to staffers. The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and lasts through November, with NOAA predicting an above-average season.</p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a legendary figure in Japanese baseball, has passed away at the age of 89 due to pneumonia. Nagashima, a People's Honor Award recipient, was renowned for his on-field achievements during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. He played a crucial role for the Yomiuri Giants, winning nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles, and later managed the team, becoming a charismatic figure transcending sports. His partnership with Sadaharu Oh, known as "O-N," made them household names, and his retirement in 1974 was a major news event.</p>

The victims were male, and the Japanese Consulate General in Shenyang was informed of the murders on May 25, citing a business dispute as the motive. The incident follows other attacks involving Japanese nationals in China, including a fatal stabbing of a schoolboy and a knife attack at a school bus stop.
