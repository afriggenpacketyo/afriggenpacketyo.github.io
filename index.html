          <p>The Israeli military announced the recovery of the bodies of two Israeli-Americans, Judi Weinstein Haggai and Gadi Haggai, who were taken hostage during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. The couple's bodies were found in the Khan Younis area of Gaza following an operation based on intelligence from the IDF and Shin Bet security service and brought back to Israel for forensic identification. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed condolences to the families and vowed to continue efforts to bring all hostages home, both living and deceased. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged decision-makers to agree to a new ceasefire deal with Hamas to secure the return of all remaining hostages, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.

          <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK has announced that the April inflation rate was overstated by 0.1 percentage points due to an error in car tax data. The annual rate was initially reported as 3.5%, but revised data shows it to be 3.4%. The error stemmed from incorrect Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport, which overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates in the first year of registration. The ONS has apologized for the error and stated that the correctly weighted data will be used from May 2025 onward, with no further statistics affected.

          <h2>Embryo 'Adoption' Used to Attack IVF</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how the Christian right is using the concept of embryo "adoption" to attack in vitro fertilization (IVF). Embryo "adoption" programs promote embryos as "preborn" children deserving a chance at life, matching white Christian families with excess embryos from IVF. This practice is framed as an alternative to IVF, which the anti-abortion movement opposes due to the testing, freezing, and discarding of embryos. While IVF is popular and widely supported, some Christian right leaders are directing followers toward embryo "adoption" as a seemingly pro-life option.

          <p>The Trump administration is spending up to $2.1 million to investigate whether diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies have influenced recent safety incidents in the aviation industry. The investigation, led by Alex Spiro, aims to determine if there is a link between DEI practices and aviation incidents. Some air traffic controllers view the investigation as a waste of money, arguing that the focus should be on addressing workforce strains and staffing shortages. The investigation seeks to answer questions about existing DEI policies and their influence on hiring practices. The optimism score is separate from the summary.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move experts say could increase costs on various products. These range from homes and cars to household items and office supplies. While the U.S. has its own domestic metals manufacturing, it also relies on imports, particularly from Canada. The higher tariffs, which went into effect on Wednesday, are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations. The move has won over some of the nation's largest steel makers, but experts say the levies will raise the cost of manufacturing. The optimism score is separate from the summary.</p>
