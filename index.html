          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have initiated a murder investigation following a man's death. A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after officers were called to a house on Sunday. Authorities suspect the incident may be connected to a separate, serious assault on a priest at St Patrick's Church in the same town. The priest was hospitalized in serious condition after being struck on the head, in what police described as a shocking and brutal attack.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid tribute to former astronaut Jim Lovell, who passed away at age 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," celebrated him as a courageous leader who inspired others to venture into the unknown. The film depicted the perilous 1970 Apollo 13 mission, which became known as a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion forced the crew to abort their moon landing and execute a daring return to Earth. Hanks remembered Lovell for undertaking his voyages not for fame, but for the challenge of exploration.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as Surgeon General under the first Trump administration, has criticized the decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to halt approximately $500 million in mRNA vaccine research funding. Adams argued that Kennedy's claims about the vaccines' ineffectiveness are untrue, citing that the technology saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and was a major achievement of Operation Warp Speed. He warned that defunding this promising area of medicine, which also shows potential for cancer and HIV treatments, will ultimately cost lives.</p>

While the incredible feat does not count as an official NFL record because it occurred in the preseason, it showcased his powerful kicking ability. The current NFL record is a 66-yard field goal set by Justin Tucker in 2021. Teammates, including quarterback Trevor Lawrence, praised the kick, highlighting the strategic advantage of having a kicker with such exceptional range for crucial game moments.</p>

The Metropolitan Police stated most arrests were for displaying placards in support of the organization, which was proscribed under the Terrorism Act in July, making such support a criminal offense. The event marks the largest number of arrests by the force on a single day in the last decade. Authorities are now processing the cases, with many protesters released on bail under the condition they do not attend future related demonstrations.</p>

          <p>A TikTok video showing a conflict over a window shade on a flight to North Carolina has gone viral, sparking a debate on airplane etiquette. The video, filmed by passenger Tori Wils, shows a hand from the seat behind her repeatedly reaching forward to pull down her window shade. Wils, who had purchased the window seat specifically for the view, eventually asked the woman to stop, and they reportedly laughed about the incident. The video amassed over 3 million views, with many commenters affirming that control of the window belongs to the person in that seat.</p>

          <p>A woman's attempt to scare away magpies using a handmade paper-mache owl resulted in an unexpected and humorous outcome. Instead of being deterred, a group of local magpies gathered around the owl figure, appearing to engage in a form of worship or reverence toward it. The amusing scene, captured on TikTok, shows the birds in what looks like a ceremonial gathering around the decoy. While fake owls are a common deterrent, experts note that intelligent birds like magpies can quickly realize they are not a real threat if they remain stationary.</p>

The Trump administration has shown a favorable stance, signing legislation that opens the door for large companies to issue digital currencies and considering a new regulatory framework. This shift comes after the crypto industry spent heavily on lobbying. However, critics warn that crypto is a highly speculative and volatile asset, rife with scams and lacking the backing of traditional investments, drawing parallels to the subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis.

The lawsuit highlights the challenge of holding tech platforms accountable, as Wozniak's legal efforts have been stalled for five years due to Section 230, a federal law that shields online platforms from liability for third-party content. Wozniak argues that platforms like YouTube have a moral responsibility to act against obvious crimes occurring on their sites, but that the current legal framework provides them with absolute immunity.</p>

The Bay of Plenty Regional Harbourmaster issued the formal ban for ships over 500 gross tons, creating an exclusion zone to prevent potential collisions or groundings in the narrow passage.

He recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he was prompted to tip 15%, 20%, or 22% for a transaction where he did most of the work himself. Sedaris humorously dissects the feeling of being a cheapskate for not selecting the highest option, even for minimal service.

Her novels frequently feature an all-knowing narrator who reveals characters' fates early on, forcing the reader to focus on themes of free will, predestination, and divine judgment.</p>

The severe weather also caused widespread damage, including to two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, forcing the displacement of 387 inmates. No injuries were reported among the prison population or staff, and all individuals are accounted for while repairs are assessed.</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a 34-year-old couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to take a 13-month career break and move to Taiwan with their young son. Their primary motivation was to allow their son to spend extended time with his paternal grandparents. The couple meticulously planned their finances, covering their U.S. mortgage by renting out their home, and timed the sabbatical for their son's kindergarten year. The experience proved transformative, allowing them to focus on health, family, and re-evaluating their career priorities away from corporate pressures.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with sophisticated new tools, corporations are responding by drafting AI agents into their cyber defense forces. These autonomous AI "teammates" are being used to automate tasks like detection, analysis, and responding to alerts, which helps to reduce the workload on human security professionals and combat burnout. Experts note that AI can handle routine tasks, such as verifying security alerts from international employee travel, freeing up human analysts to focus on more complex threats.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is examined as a modern entry into the long literary tradition of stories about strange and mystical sisters. The article reviews the book, which is about five sisters in the 18th century who are accused of turning into dogs, and places it in a lineage with the weird sisters of "Macbeth." It argues that such stories use a group of enigmatic sisters to test other characters and explore societal fears surrounding femininity, conformity, and the unknown. The novel directly engages with these tropes, questioning why female power is often perceived as monstrous.</p>

          <p>According to an expert who helps Americans move abroad, Albania is an increasingly popular yet often overlooked destination for those seeking to relocate to Europe. The country's appeal lies in its significant affordability, with comfortable apartments available for under $500 a month, and its stunning natural scenery. A major advantage for Americans is the ability to stay for up to one year without a visa, allowing for a "test drive" of expat life. The combination of a low cost of living, welcoming locals, and a growing expat community makes it an attractive option.</p>
