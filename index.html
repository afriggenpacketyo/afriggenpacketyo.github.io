          <p>After numerous delays, the Real ID Act is now in effect, requiring Americans to use Real IDs or other compliant forms of identification for domestic air travel and entering federal buildings. The Transportation Security Administration reports that about 81% of travelers are already compliant, but those without a Real ID can still use alternative forms of identification such as passports or permanent resident cards, however TSA suggests arriving three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security. Enhanced Driver's Licenses issued by Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, and Vermont are also acceptable alternatives, allowing land and sea travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean without a passport. The Real ID Act was established following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to set standards for identification.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, but revenue growth fell short of anticipated targets, causing a 5% drop in the company's stock. Despite the revenue miss, Uber reported a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant improvement from the previous year's loss, while gross bookings increased by 14%. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted the success of Uber One, despite an FTC lawsuit alleging deceptive billing practices, and emphasized the company's advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, with 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. Uber has expanded its autonomous vehicle partnerships with companies like Waymo and Volkswagen, viewing AVs as a significant opportunity for future growth.</p>

          <p>While the national average savings account interest rate is low, high-yield savings accounts offer significantly better returns for consumers looking to grow their savings. Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, with some accounts offering rates between 4.10% and 4.45%. Financial experts recommend choosing a high-yield savings account, comparing different accounts, and considering online banks to maximize interest earnings. These accounts are a safe place to store an emergency fund, offering interest that could give your savings a boost, preparing you for a financial emergency.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India launched missile strikes into Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, citing infrastructure used by militants linked to a recent tourist massacre. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed retaliation, conducting security exercises and simulations for potential blackouts and mass evacuations. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Pakistan issued a security alert, advising citizens to avoid areas near the India-Pakistan border. Despite the heightened tensions, Pakistan reportedly reopened airports in major cities, offering a glimmer of hope for de-escalation, though analysts warn of real risks of further escalation between the two nuclear-armed countries.</p>

          <p>Renewable energy production in the United States has tripled over the past decade, driven by solar, wind, and geothermal sources, leading to reduced emissions and improved energy system resilience. Despite this progress, the Trump administration's policies have led to the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in clean energy investments. Market uncertainty and debates over clean energy tax credits are contributing factors to the investment pullback, even with the Inflation Reduction Act extending renewable energy tax credits until 2032. While renewable energy growth is benefiting states across the political spectrum, the future of clean energy investments remains uncertain due to policy shifts.</p>

Key lessons include the potential for high costs, Rwanda's limited capacity to accommodate large numbers of deportees, and the risk of legal challenges based on human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its weight loss drug Wegovy in the latter half of the year, due to the anticipated phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The company's first-quarter sales of Wegovy fell slightly below expectations due to competition from these alternatives, however, with the FDA ending the drug shortage ruling, Novo Nordisk expects sales to rebound. The company is launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to lower Wegovy costs and provide a safe alternative for patients.</p>

          <p>Far-UVC light, a type of ultraviolet light that can kill airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes, is emerging as a promising approach to fighting respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. New developments in solid-state lamps, particularly secondary harmonics, could make far-UVC disinfection significantly cheaper and more accessible. Research is ongoing to understand the effects of far-UVC on air quality, but early findings suggest that moderate use can disinfect without causing concerning levels of ozone or particulate pollution. Ubiquitous far-UVC lamps could become a formidable tool in preventing the spread of future pandemics.</p>
