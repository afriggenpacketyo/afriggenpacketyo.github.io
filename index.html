          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ruled that her continued detention violated her First Amendment rights. Ozturk was arrested for co-authoring an opinion piece critical of Israel and was accused by the Department of Homeland Security of supporting Hamas, which she denies. Judge William Sessions stated there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence by Ozturk and her detention could chill the speech of millions of non-citizens. The ACLU and Tufts University expressed their delight at her release and welcomed her back to campus.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a recently fired commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), is prepared to challenge his dismissal in court, arguing it is illegal. Trumka's firing came after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency, fearing it would compromise product safety. Consumer Reports and several Democratic senators have condemned the firings, calling them an attack on the independence of the CPSC, which regulates the safety of consumer products and handles recalls. The White House maintains the president has the right to fire employees in the executive branch.</p>

          <p>The Tahoe Truckee Unified School District (TTUSD) in California is switching sports conferences to allow trans athletes to participate in girls' sports, leading to concerns among some girl athletes and parents. The move comes after Nevada's Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) voted to ban trans athletes from girls' sports, while California law prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. Some girl athletes expressed fears about competing against trans athletes, citing physical advantages, and raised concerns about privacy in locker rooms and increased travel risks due to weather conditions on Donner Pass. The school district defends its decision as necessary for legal compliance with California state law.</p>

          <p>After a militant attack in Kashmir, India and Pakistan have escalated their conflict, engaging in airstrikes, drone attacks, and gunfire exchanges. Pakistan accused India of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting air bases, while India claimed Pakistan attempted aerial intrusions with hundreds of drones. The conflict has led to civilian casualties, and residents in Kashmir are expressing exhaustion and fear. The use of drone warfare marks a new dimension in the hostilities between the two nuclear-armed nations. Tensions remain high, with no immediate signs of de-escalation, and both countries have suspended or moved their cricket leagues due to safety concerns.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak Office of the Inspector General report revealed that over 100 current and former Amtrak employees conspired with New York medical professionals to defraud the company's health care plan of over $12 million.

Twelve Amtrak employees and three healthcare providers have been criminally charged, with two employees pleading guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

          <p>The United States and China are set to resume trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since the U.S. imposed tariffs on China. Both countries have signaled a desire to break the deadlock, but neither wants to appear to be backing down. The tariffs have hurt both economies, with factory output in China taking a hit and the U.S. economy contracting. The timing of the talks coincides with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, highlighting China's alternative global leadership role.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, which could result in new tariffs. The investigation is being conducted under a provision of the Trade Expansion Act, allowing the president to impose tariffs on foreign products in the interest of national security. The aerospace industry, which relies heavily on global suppliers, has expressed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs. Boeing has described the direct effects of existing tariffs as minor but is worried about the impact on its suppliers.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending the writ of habeas corpus for migrants. This action would curtail the constitutional right to challenge the legality of a person's detention by the government. Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing that the U.S. faces an "invasion" of undocumented migrants. The writ has been suspended only four times since the U.S. Constitution was ratified, and in most cases, Congress authorized the suspension first.</p>

This delay contrasts with the regular stream of arms shipments during the Biden administration. The Trump administration has outlined conditions for future aid, including demands for Ukraine to share its critical minerals.
