          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, a two-way player, while Shedeur Sanders surprisingly dropped out of the first round. The draft emphasized offensive and defensive lines, with only one quarterback, Ward, chosen in the top 12. The New York Giants later traded back into the first round to pick Jaxson Dart. The draft was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for the first time. Rounds two and three will take place Friday beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern Time, while rounds four through seven will be held Saturday beginning at noon.</p>

          <p>The Nikkei index experienced a surge in gains, briefly rising over 2% due to a weaker yen.

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that trade discussions with China are ongoing, contradicting Beijing's denial of any current negotiations. Trump stated that meetings occurred, although he did not disclose the participants, while China's Ministry of Commerce insisted there are no ongoing trade talks and called for the removal of "unilateral" tariff measures to resolve trade issues. This divergence in statements highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of the trade relationship between the United States and China. The White House had recently imposed higher tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has voiced his disapproval of the recent deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv, stating he is "not happy" and urging President Vladimir Putin to "stop." These attacks, which resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries, have complicated efforts to broker a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. Trump indicated he is applying pressure on both sides to end the war and suggested his special envoy would be holding talks with Putin in Moscow.
