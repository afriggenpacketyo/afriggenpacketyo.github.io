          <p>A U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea after an arrestment failure during landing, marking the second such incident in just over a week. Both pilots safely ejected and sustained minor injuries, with no flight deck personnel harmed. This incident follows a previous one where a Super Hornet fell overboard during towing in the hangar bay. The USS Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024, including mistakenly shooting down one of their own planes and colliding with a merchant vessel.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to hold talks in Switzerland to de-escalate trade tensions, marking the first high-level in-person contact since President Trump's tariff hikes. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the focus would be on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, aiming to establish future discussion topics. While the U.S. seeks to decouple from China in strategic industries like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and steel, China insists on defending its development interests and the global trade order. Both countries have imposed retaliatory duties, with the U.S. holding off on tariffs for most partners except China until July.</p>

          <p>Long Beach has partnered with Throne Labs to install four 'smart' public restrooms throughout the city, accessible via QR codes or access cards. The restrooms, equipped with a toilet, urinal, and sink, are designed to address restroom gaps in high-traffic areas. Users are subject to a 10-minute time limit, after which the doors will open automatically to discourage loitering and ensure safety. The city will analyze usage data and cost to determine whether to continue the program.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone towards Canada during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, despite previously criticizing the country.

Carney, however, firmly stated that Canada is not for sale. Trump covered a wide range of topics during the meeting, including unrelated subjects such as Barack Obamaâ€™s presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to tariffs imposed by President Trump. The company, which imports about 90% of its bikes from China, faced a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs on a recent shipment. The company has canceled new orders from China for April and has no plans to place new orders in May, due to the increasing cost of the products.

          <p>China, a top aluminum producer and consumer, relies on imported aluminum ore due to a lack of high-quality bauxite. However, a plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminum from Chinaâ€™s low-grade ore. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology.</p>
