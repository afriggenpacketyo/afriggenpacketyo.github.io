        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia is seeking to increase its halal product exports to Gulf nations, driven by the growing Muslim population's demand for a wider range of halal-certified goods, including pet food and cosmetics. Malaysian businesses are looking for deeper market access to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries as the United States restricts access to its consumer base. Negotiations between ASEAN and the GCC are expected to reduce red tape at Gulf ports, streamlining the export process. Sales of Malaysian cosmetics to the Middle East have also increased due to boycotts of Western brands over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p>

          <p>China's labor market is more vulnerable as trade negotiations with the U.S. resume amid a struggling economy and high youth unemployment. A persistent property slowdown and stricter regulations have reduced job opportunities, making the preservation of manufacturing jobs critical. A research report indicates that maintaining current U.S. tariff levels could halve exports to the U.S., resulting in up to six million manufacturing job losses, with a full-scale trade war potentially causing nine million job losses. Some Chinese companies are already reducing hiring due to tariff-related issues, and workers are increasingly turning to gig jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged this year due to economic uncertainty driven by U.S. tariff policies, leading investors to seek safe investments. Central banks' purchases of gold have increased fivefold since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began, and demand from governments is expected to remain high. Countries are experimenting with gold-backed digital assets and trading systems to bypass the dollar-denominated financial system, with some using gold to evade sanctions. This increased central bank activity is driving a long-term structural shift in demand for the metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has allocated 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer amid rising inflation. This measure is part of a larger relief package to counter the economic impact of hefty U.S. tariffs, including those on the auto industry. The subsidies aim to reduce household energy bills by approximately 1,040 yen in July and September, and 1,260 yen in August. Critics suggest the measures are intended to bolster government support ahead of the House of Councillors election. </p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in northern Arkansas for Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault, who escaped from a high-security prison. Hardin, dressed in a makeshift law enforcement uniform, slipped out of the Calico Rock North Central Unit. He is considered extremely dangerous, and residents are warned not to approach him. The search has widened due to the amount of time that has passed since his escape, with law enforcement officials suspecting he may seek to steal a vehicle. </p>
