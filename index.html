        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated series "Family Guy" has once again targeted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, marking the second time the show has mocked the couple. In a recent episode, a character lists "Prince Harry marrying Meghan Markle" among history's worst events, prompting a cutaway gag showing a cartoon Harry reacting to the joke. This follows a 2023 episode that satirized their Netflix deal and sponsored content, adding to a trend of animated comedies like "South Park" parodying the couple's public life since their royal departure.</p>

          <p>In a significant development following devastating floods in Texas, officials in Kerr County have drastically reduced the number of individuals considered missing from nearly 100 to just three. This update comes after extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies successfully verified that many people initially reported as missing were in fact alive and safe. The news provides a small measure of relief amidst the tragedy, as the overall death toll from the July 4 flooding across Texas has surpassed 130, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>England's national rugby team achieved a decisive 40-5 victory against the United States in a match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players and spectators to seek shelter both before kickoff and during the first half. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, concluding their tour of Argentina and the United States with a perfect three-win record while also giving debuts to several new players.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was tragically killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, authorities have charged two individuals with his murder. The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced that Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, is accused of being the shooter, while Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, allegedly drove the getaway vehicle. A breakthrough in the cold case was achieved using recently available technology to enhance surveillance video, which led to detailed suspect sketches and their eventual arrests, bringing a long-awaited step towards justice.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to introduce a new criminal offense to target individuals who plan mass attacks but are not motivated by a specific ideology, closing a perceived gap in the law. The proposed legislation would give police powers to apprehend and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws, even without an ideological motive. This move comes in response to incidents like the Southport attack, where the perpetrator's violent plotting could not be addressed with serious charges until after the killings occurred.</p>

The decision came after Betts continued to show signs of frustration and poor performance following the All-Star break, with his batting average dipping to a career-low .241. Roberts expressed hope that having Betts watch a game from the dugout, rather than playing, could provide a beneficial mental reset for the player, who is unaccustomed to such a prolonged slump.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday, with various perspectives on the potential impacts on students, parents, and teachers. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help mitigate "holiday hunger" for children on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, contend the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and shortening it could concentrate holiday demand, potentially driving up travel costs further.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in Westbury, New York, after being pulled into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine while a scan was in progress. According to police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain around his neck when he entered the MRI room, causing the machine's powerful magnet to draw him in. The incident resulted in a fatal "medical episode," and police are now investigating the death. The FDA warns that the strong magnetic fields of MRI machines can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who previously played for the Clippers for six seasons and led the "Lob City" era, would add significant playmaking depth to the roster alongside James Harden and Bradley Beal. Frank emphasized the team's goal to enhance its ballhandling and acknowledged that any player joining would understand they are coming into a reserve role on the team.</p>

Berger, a two-time cancer survivor, has become Germany's number one goalkeeper and will now lead her team into a semifinal match against World Cup winners Spain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of rapid growth, interest in learning Mandarin appears to be waning in several Western countries, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. In the U.S., university enrollments in Mandarin language courses fell by 25% between 2013 and 2021, according to the Modern Language Association. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including geopolitical tensions, reduced cultural exchange opportunities, and a perception of diminishing career advantages, marking a significant shift from when Mandarin was widely hailed as the language of the future.</p>

Usyk, who also defeated Dubois in 2023, put his opponent down twice in the fifth before the referee stopped the contest, extending his perfect professional record to 24 wins. The victory reunifies the heavyweight division's four major belts under Usyk, who reclaimed the IBF title that was stripped from him shortly after his previous unification.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and threatened to end the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico, escalating a trade dispute over aviation policies. The U.S. Transportation Department claims that Mexico violated a trade agreement by forcing airlines to move flights from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, giving domestic carriers an unfair advantage. All Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules until the issue is resolved.</p>

His round included an incredible 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole, which generated one of the loudest roars of his career, moments after a strange bogey on the 11th where his shot was affected by a buried golf ball. Finishing the day at eight under par, McIlroy is six shots behind the leader, Scottie Scheffler, but feels he has given himself an outside chance for victory.</p>
