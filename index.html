          <p>The Republican National Committee holds a significant cash advantage over the Democratic National Committee, with nearly five times more funds on hand. This disparity, amounting to a $57 million gap, marks the widest difference between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported $72 million in its coffers at the end of May, while the DNC had only $15 million. Some Democrats express concern that the fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, while the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, raising roughly $40 million in individual donations since February.

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian advised that a Republican proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states would violate the chamber's rules. This is a setback for President Trump's tax and spending cut bill, as the Republicans were counting on savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to offset the costs of the tax breaks plan. The parliamentarian did let stand a provision that would impose new work requirements for older Americans receiving food stamp aid. Senator Amy Klobuchar stated that this ruling makes clear that Senate Republicans cannot shift major nutrition assistance costs to the states.</p>
