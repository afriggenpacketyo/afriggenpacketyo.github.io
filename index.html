        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines announced plans to cut flight capacity in the latter half of the year, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker domestic bookings. The airline anticipates unit revenue to remain flat or decline by up to 4% in the second quarter compared to the previous year. Southwest is also retracting its earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026 due to the unpredictable booking trends. This decision mirrors similar moves by United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have also scaled back domestic capacity amidst economic ambiguity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring investments in companies involved in mining and processing critical minerals to reduce U.S. reliance on imports, particularly from China, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. The proposed strategy includes equity investments through a sovereign wealth fund, sovereign risk insurance to protect companies from political changes, and stockpiling key minerals similar to the strategic petroleum reserve. This initiative aims to counter China's practice of dumping minerals on the international market and ensure a stable supply chain for essential industries like defense and energy. The U.S. imported 80% of its rare earth elements in 2024, with 70% of those imports coming from China.</p>

          <p>President Trump argued that undocumented migrants should not be given trials to challenge their removal from the country. He stated that the system wasn't designed for trials for thousands of people facing deportation. His comments follow a Supreme Court order temporarily blocking the administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants. Immigration matters are typically handled in limited hearings before an immigration judge, not full trials. The ACLU has criticized the administration's deportation efforts, citing due process violations.</p>

Meaningful remedies require structural separation supported by behavioral changes to prevent future anticompetitive behaviors, including in the market for artificial intelligence.

          <p>Early spring heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, causing greater harm to human health. The timing of these heat waves is particularly dangerous because people are less acclimatized to high temperatures.

High humidity, measured by the wet-bulb globe temperature, is exacerbating the risks. To mitigate the dangers, it's important to pay attention to weather forecasts, stay hydrated, and recognize the warning signs of heat-related complications.</p>
