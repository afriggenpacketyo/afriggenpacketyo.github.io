        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on data software company Palantir, expressing that he is "inspired" by its high market valuation while also noting its software is the "most expensive" he has ever seen. Despite Salesforce being ten times larger by revenue, Palantir is experiencing much faster growth, making it a popular stock with retail investors. Benioff highlighted that the two companies sometimes compete for government contracts, pointing to a recent U.S. Army deal that Salesforce won over Palantir. The comments underscore the competitive dynamic between the established tech giant and the rapidly growing data analytics firm.</p>

          <p>An assistant campus director at George Washington University, Anthony Pohorilak, stated on social media that the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was "fair" due to Kirk's pro-gun advocacy. In a Facebook post, Pohorilak suggested that those who advocate for gun ownership are not immune to the consequences of gun violence. George Washington University condemned all forms of violence and clarified that the employee's opinions do not represent the university. The incident is one of several where individuals have faced professional consequences for celebrating or justifying the killing on social media.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The suspect was apprehended within 33 hours after his father recognized him in photos released by law enforcement and persuaded him to surrender. Officials revealed that Robinson had become more political in recent years and had expressed negative views about Kirk. Investigators recovered the rifle believed to have been used in the attack, along with shell casings engraved with anti-fascist and taunting messages, providing insight into the planning of what officials have termed a "political assassination."</p>

          <p>Great Britain has established a commanding 2-0 lead against Poland in their Davis Cup World Group 1 tennis tie. Cameron Norrie, ranked 34th in the world, secured the first point with a hard-fought victory over Tomasz Berkieta. Following this, Arthur Fery, making an unexpected Davis Cup debut due to an injury to a teammate, won his match against Olaf Pieczkowski. A single additional win on Saturday will advance Great Britain to next year's qualifiers, keeping them in contention for the 2026 title and avoiding a potential relegation play-off.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has highlighted his significant influence in reshaping conservative politics for Generation Z. Through his organization Turning Point USA, Kirk transformed campus conservatism from a fringe movement into a mainstream cultural identity, attracting millions of followers and raising substantial funds. He mastered the new media landscape, using viral debates and a network of influencers to build a strong parasocial connection with his audience. By tapping into Gen Z's rejection of the establishment and desire for open debate, Kirk created a powerful counterculture that resonated with many young people, leaving a lasting legacy on youth political engagement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal appeals court to permit the immediate firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following a lower court's decision to block her removal. President Trump moved to dismiss Cook, a Biden appointee, based on allegations of misrepresentation on mortgage documents. The administration argues that the president has broad authority to remove officials and is requesting a decision before next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where a key decision on interest rates is expected. Cook's removal would allow Trump to appoint a successor, potentially giving him more influence over the central bank's monetary policy.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox delivered a powerful plea for civility and an end to political rage. Known for his "Disagree Better" initiative, Cox urged young Americans to reject violence and embrace difficult conversations with those who hold differing views. He framed the current political climate as dangerously polarized, referencing other recent acts of political violence and stressing that a healthy democracy requires the safe exchange of ideas. Cox's message of de-escalation stands as a call to find an offramp from the nation's path of escalating political hostility.</p>

Spirit Airlines, which recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year, has faced challenges from weaker demand and high costs.

          <p>Over 3,000 striking Boeing defense workers in the St. Louis area have voted to reject the company's most recent contract proposal, extending a walkout that began in early August. The union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, stated that the modified offer did not include a sufficient signing bonus or improvements to 401(k) benefits. The striking employees, who primarily assemble F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, are determined to continue their stand for a better agreement. In response, Boeing expressed disappointment and stated it will continue with its contingency plan, which includes hiring permanent replacement workers.</p>

          <p>Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been sworn in as Nepal's interim prime minister, becoming the first woman to lead the nation. Her appointment follows days of intense anti-corruption protests that resulted in over 50 deaths and forced the resignation of the previous government. The protests, initially sparked by a social media ban, quickly grew into a mass movement against the political elite. Karki, who is widely seen as having a clean image, will lead a caretaker government tasked with restoring order and organizing general elections scheduled for next March.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, market watchers are focused on the record $7.6 trillion currently held in high-yield money market funds. Some analysts believe this "wall of cash" could flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds as yields on cash-equivalent investments decline. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds belong to institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift into the stock market. They contend that only a return to near-zero interest rates, seen during major economic crises, would trigger a significant outflow from these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically to capitalize on the opportunity. Experts recommend that buyers monitor the market closely, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of formal Federal Reserve decisions, meaning the best time to lock in a rate may be fleeting. It is also crucial for applicants to have a high credit score, as the most favorable rates are reserved for the most qualified borrowers. Finally, buyers are reminded of the importance of getting pre-approved to demonstrate seriousness to sellers and to avoid losing a desired home while waiting for even lower rates.

Powell, who has nearly 300 acting credits, emphasized that he has always prioritized taking roles that resonate with his audience, a strategy he says has sustained his long career.

His arrest in March on separate corruption charges sparked widespread protests, and this trial is viewed by his supporters as another attempt to sideline him from Turkish politics.</p>

President Trump has urged Republicans not to negotiate with Democrats, increasing the likelihood that Congress will fail to pass the necessary appropriations bills.
