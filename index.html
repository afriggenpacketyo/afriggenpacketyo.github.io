          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stark warning that Republican fiscal proposals, backed by President Trump, could lead to more than three million state residents losing their Medi-Cal health coverage. The proposed plan involves significant cuts to Medicaid and the implementation of work requirements to access benefits. Newsom described the potential impact as devastating and cruel, noting that it would disproportionately harm the very voters who supported Trump. The state estimates it could lose over $28 billion in federal funding, exacerbating its budget deficit without the means to cover the shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives faced a significant delay on a key procedural vote for President Trump's extensive domestic policy bill due to opposition from within the Republican party. GOP leadership and the White House scrambled to secure support, as defections from both moderate and conservative members threatened its passage ahead of a July 4 deadline. Holdouts expressed concerns over changes made in the Senate version, particularly regarding cuts to health programs and the bill's overall cost.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists from multiple institutions has reportedly developed a new form of blockchain technology designed to be secure against attacks from future quantum computers. Standard blockchain systems rely on encryption algorithms that are vulnerable to the immense processing power of quantum computing. The new solution aims to safeguard the integrity and security of digital ledgers used in finance and supply chain management. This technological advancement addresses a critical emerging threat to digital security as quantum capabilities continue to develop globally, positioning China at the forefront of this defensive technology.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has become just the 20th player in Major League Baseball history to record 3,000 career strikeouts. He achieved the historic milestone in the sixth inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox, striking out Vinny Capra on a called third strike. The achievement was celebrated with a video tribute at Dodger Stadium and an ovation from the crowd. The momentous occasion for the veteran pitcher was made even better as the Dodgers went on to win the game 5-4 in a dramatic walk-off fashion in the ninth inning.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have officially confirmed the discovery of a third interstellar object, a cosmic visitor from beyond our solar system, which has been designated 3I/Atlas. The object, classified as a comet, is believed to be the largest such visitor yet detected, estimated at 10-20 kilometers wide, and is currently traveling at over 60 kilometers per second. It poses no threat to Earth and will pass just inside the orbit of Mars before exiting the solar system. This rare discovery provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study material that originated from another star system.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively looking to elevate its relationship with China to a strategic partnership as it diversifies its foreign policy beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. In an interview, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated that both nations have a mutual interest in officially upgrading their ties. This diplomatic pivot follows Armenia's frustration with Russia's failure to intervene in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its subsequent decision to withdraw from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Strengthening relations with Beijing represents a significant step in Armenia's strategy to build new international alliances.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New York acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison each. The verdict concluded a high-profile trial that featured graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse and coercion. Combs, who will remain in detention pending sentencing, reacted with emotion in the courtroom as the split verdict was read, while prosecutors calculate a potential sentence of four to five years.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is experiencing a dramatic resurgence in its initial public offering (IPO) market, positioning it to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. The surge is fueled by a wave of mainland Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, driven by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on the mainland, and ample market liquidity. New listing volumes in the first half of the year soared to $14 billion, a massive increase from the same period in 2024, signaling renewed investor confidence after several lackluster years.

          <p>President Trump's signature tax and spending bill has hit a wall in the House of Representatives, with key factions of his own party refusing to support it. The primary sticking points for the holdouts are concerns over the bill's fiscal impact and its social policy changes. Conservative fiscal hawks are alarmed by estimates that the legislation could add over $3 trillion to the national deficit, while moderate Republicans are worried about deep cuts to Medicaid that could strip health coverage from millions of their constituents, creating a political impasse.

The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.

          <p>An official review has found that historical investigations into child grooming cases in Greater Manchester were significantly hampered because Manchester City Council provided heavily redacted evidence to police. The watchdog report noted that some documents were so obscured they were unusable, which delayed inquiries, including the high-profile Operations Green Jacket and Bernese. The council cited complex data-sharing rules as the reason for the redactions, fearing prosecutions could be jeopardized. Since these issues were identified, the police, council, and prosecutors have established a new, more effective protocol for sharing information.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that women under 55 using a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms may face a higher risk of breast cancer. The research, published in The Lancet Oncology, determined that a combination of estrogen and progestin increases the risk, whereas using estrogen alone actually reduces it. This distinction is crucial, as women with a uterus must take the combination therapy to avoid other health risks. The findings refine the medical community's understanding of hormone replacement therapy, highlighting that the type and timing of treatment are critical factors in its safety profile.</p>
