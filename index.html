          <p>Overnight Israeli air strikes across Gaza have reportedly killed at least 54 Palestinians, according to hospital directors speaking with the BBC. One strike hit the Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City, which was housing displaced families, resulting in many severely burned bodies, including children. The Israeli military stated it targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control center, accusing Hamas of using the Gazan population as human shields. The Red Cross reported two of its staff were also killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis, highlighting the high civilian death toll in Gaza. The event is part of an escalating offensive in northern Gaza. </p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at the age of 97. His landmark film debunked the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II, interviewing ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand to reveal the complexities of collaboration and resistance. Originally banned from French television, the film sparked controversy but ultimately paved the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls later directed "H√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," earning him an Academy Award.</p>

Ilhan Omar and former Rep. Cori Bush for messages that seemed to confuse Memorial Day with Veterans Day, and underscores the importance of choosing words that reflect the gravity of the day.

          <p>Peter R. Orszag, former budget director, expresses concern over the deteriorating U.S. fiscal situation, noting that annual federal budget deficits are running high and interest rates on 10-year Treasuries have more than doubled. He highlights that the government is projected to spend more on interest payments than on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare. Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and promoting policies that generate fiscal savings in entitlement programs. He cautions that the current budget legislation moving through Congress would exacerbate these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision aims to avoid confusion related to marriage or divorce involving Japanese and foreigners, acknowledging Taiwan in the registry.</p>

However, critics point out that the new requirements could cause many to lose Medicaid coverage. Johnson claims that the bill is focused on fraud, waste, and abuse, and that it will strengthen Medicaid and SNAP programs.</p>
