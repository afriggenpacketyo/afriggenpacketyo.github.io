        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump mobilized approximately 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to support the California National Guard during protests over federal immigration enforcement actions. This decision prompted Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta to announce a lawsuit against Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth, alleging the federalization of the National Guard was unlawful and exceeded presidential authority without Newsom's consent. Trump responded by saying he would support arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. The governor criticized Trump's actions as an unwarranted escalation and an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of mobilizing the military against citizens. The situation remains tense as legal challenges and political disputes unfold. Optimism is tempered given the escalation of force and the deepening political divide.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel advising the CDC on vaccine recommendations. Kennedy stated this action was necessary to restore public confidence in vaccine science, claiming the panel had conflicts of interest and acted as a rubber stamp for vaccines. This decision follows Kennedy's previous moves to alter vaccination policies, including halting routine COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. Experts have expressed concern that this shake-up could lead to politicized recommendations and increased distrust in the CDC, as the new committee's composition remains uncertain. The situation is unsettling as it introduces uncertainty into established public health protocols.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown have raised questions about the potential use of the Insurrection Act. This act, signed in 1807 by President Thomas Jefferson, allows the president to deploy armed forces to suppress insurrections or enforce federal laws when ordinary judicial proceedings are impractical. While Trump has deployed the National Guard under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which allows for federal service members to protect federal personnel and property, he has not invoked the Insurrection Act. Legal experts warn that the Insurrection Act is overly broad and vague, and Governor Newsom is suing the administration over the National Guard deployment, arguing it violates state sovereignty. The situation is tense due to the potential for further escalation and the constitutional questions at play.</p>

          <p>Billy Boston, a legendary figure in rugby league, is set to become the sport's first-ever knight. The 90-year-old Cardiff-born player, who starred for Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, will receive the honor at Buckingham Palace due to concerns over his health. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy hailed the knighthood as an "historic milestone" and a recognition of rugby league's contribution to national life. The move follows frustration over the lack of rugby league knighthoods, with MPs suggesting snobbery was a factor. The event is a celebration of a sporting icon and a long-overdue recognition for the sport.</p>

          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, expressing concerns about the politicization of research, interrupted global collaboration, and budget cuts. The letter, addressed to NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, calls for the reinstatement of staff and restoration of funding. Signatories claim these policies undermine the NIH mission and harm public health. The administration's response suggests some misconceptions in the letter, but acknowledges the value of respectful dissent in science.

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to numerous arrests and the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops by President Trump. The protests began after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations. Demonstrations have been largely confined to downtown LA, with reports of vehicles set alight, looting, and clashes between protesters and police. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned Trump's actions and filed a lawsuit, arguing that the deployment violates states' rights.

          <p>A four-year-old child's plea for his father, detained in an immigration raid at the Ambience Apparel factory in Los Angeles, underscores the human impact of these operations. The father, Mario Romero, is among 14 indigenous Zapotec individuals arrested during the raid, leaving families in distress. Family members and community activists have gathered to demand the release of those detained and prevent their deportation.

          <p>President Trump has announced a federal program providing $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American babies, with backing from business leaders who plan to contribute billions more. The "Trump accounts" would be tax-deferred investment accounts tracking stock market performance for children born between 2025 and 2029. The program has passed the House as part of a budget bill but faces Senate Republican resistance. The congressional budget office has found that the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt while cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs. The initiative aims to provide a financial head start for future generations, but its feasibility depends on legislative approval and economic factors. (not investment advice)</p>

Sixty-one percent of women identify as "pro-choice," compared to only 41% of men. This gender gap is likely due to increased support for abortion among women since Roe's collapse. The poll also reveals record disagreement over the morality of abortion, with women more likely to view it as moral than men.
