          <p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested on federal charges related to illegal sports betting and money laundering. Prosecutors allege Rozier and others used nonpublic information about NBA player injuries to gain an unfair advantage in placing wagers. This case is part of a broader federal investigation into illegal gambling and organized crime, which also led to the arrest of Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups in a separate, but related, rigged poker game scheme. The NBA has placed both Rozier and Billups on immediate leave as it cooperates with authorities, emphasizing the seriousness of the allegations for the game's integrity.</p>

Intel also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, aiming to integrate its CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to boost its data center business. The company expects chip demand to outpace supply next year and is expanding its Intel Foundry operations, despite needing substantial capital investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is personally donating millions towards the construction of a new White House ballroom, with satellite imagery confirming the demolition of the East Wing is largely complete. The project, now estimated at $300 million, has drawn scrutiny due to its rapid execution and initial claims that the existing structure would be untouched. White House officials assert that demolition did not require approval, only "vertical construction," citing a legal opinion from the National Capital Planning Commission. Trump stated that donations have exceeded the project's cost, reaching an estimated $350 million.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), an independent advisory panel whose recommendations influence insurance coverage, faces accusations of prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) ideals over evidence-based medicine. Critics, including the GOP Doctors Caucus and conservative watchdog groups, allege the task force has been "hijacked by left-wing partisans." Examples cited include recommendations to consider race in anxiety screenings and emphasizing breastfeeding in Black mothers due to historical context, as well as promoting gender-neutral terminology. The Health and Human Services Department is investigating these allegations, and the Supreme Court recently upheld the task force's authority to compel coverage.</p>

          <p>Apple has commenced shipping advanced servers for artificial intelligence applications from a new factory in Houston, Texas. This move is a key part of Apple's $600 billion commitment to U.S. advanced manufacturing and suppliers, aligning with President Donald Trump's call for more domestic tech production. The servers, which power Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services using Apple's own silicon, were previously manufactured overseas. The Houston facility is expected to create thousands of jobs, and Apple plans further expansion next year. This initiative highlights a significant shift towards localizing high-tech manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring formal approval for nearly all Department of Defense correspondence and interactions with Congress. This new directive mandates that most offices, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and military department secretaries, coordinate all legislative affairs activities through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs. The memo states that "unauthorized engagements" could undermine departmental legislative objectives. Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Jack Reed and Representative Adam Smith, have expressed deep concern, citing potential impacts on transparency, timely information flow, and congressional oversight, raising questions about government accountability.</p>

The union, representing 12,000 workers across 550 cafes, has staged national strikes previously and seeks increased hours, higher pay, and resolution of "unfair labor practice charges" for alleged union busting. Starbucks claims it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but states the union walked away from the table. The company maintains it offers competitive pay and benefits, but the union asserts workers are not receiving enough hours.</p>

          <p>Disney has warned YouTube TV subscribers that its networks, including ABC and ESPN, may be dropped from the service by October 30 if a new distribution agreement is not reached. This potential blackout follows a recent agreement between YouTube TV and NBCUniversal, avoiding a similar disruption. Disney alleges Google is exploiting its position and proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices for consumers while benefiting Google's own live TV products. YouTube TV, with 10 million subscribers, is seeking better rates and the ability to integrate Disney's streaming content, a request Disney has rejected.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new White House ballroom, currently under construction in the East Wing, has drawn significant criticism, particularly regarding its financing and timing amidst a federal government shutdown.

Critics, including ethics experts, deem the opulence inappropriate during a shutdown when federal workers are unpaid, and warn of potential corruption from companies seeking favor.

It suggests that most gold types are worth considering now, as price declines are often temporary, and many Costco buyers have already seen significant gains. Costco offers an accessible, vetted option for physical bullion without shipping costs for members, though sales are final. For broader investment strategies, specialized gold investing companies offer more diverse options and tailored support. (not investment advice)</p>
