          <p>A 12-year-old girl sustained serious, but non-life-threatening injuries after an alligator encounter at Lake Waccamaw in North Carolina. The incident occurred while the girl was swimming with other children in about four feet of water, prompting immediate removal of the children from the lake. Authorities responded, with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) noting the alligator, a 12-foot male, caused lacerations and scratches on the girl's legs. As per protocol, the alligator was euthanized following the incident, which the NCWRC deemed unusual and non-predatory, also reminding residents and visitors to remain vigilant around water and to maintain a safe distance from wildlife. The NCWRC also asked to be notified of large alligators that are spending time around a pier or in the lake in daylight hours, also any alligator that regularly approaches people or is exhibiting a general lack of fear or aggressive behavior.</p>

          <p>A section of Interstate 40 within the Great Smoky Mountains has been closed due to heavy rain, flooding, and a rock slide. The incident occurred around mile marker 450 in Tennessee, near the North Carolina state line, causing significant disruption to cross-country travel. This section of I-40 had previously been heavily damaged by Hurricane Helene in September, and while temporary repairs had opened one lane in each direction, the new flooding and slide have necessitated another closure. The long-term solution involves driving steel rods into the bedrock and spraying concrete on the cliff face, a process expected to take years to complete, also causing trucks to get stuck on twisty narrow mountain roads and are banned on another major highway through the area U.S. 441 through Great Smoky Mountains National Park.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has released new guidance for assessing applications for North Sea oil and gas projects, requiring operators to evaluate emissions from burning the extracted oil and gas, not just production emissions. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling and will impact the controversial Rosebank and Jackdaw fields, with fresh approval needed for extraction. While Energy Minister Michael Shanks asserts the guidance provides clarity for the industry's future, climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely reduce the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels. The government will consider economic impacts alongside environmental concerns, with decisions expected by the end of the summer.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has advocated for continued negotiations to de-escalate the conflict between Israel and Iran, as President Trump weighs potential military action. Conservative figures, including Dame Priti Patel and Jeremy Hunt, have urged the UK to support the US should it attack Iran, while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has called for any legal advice regarding UK involvement to be published. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is scheduled to meet with US counterpart Marco Rubio and EU diplomat Kaja Kallas to discuss the situation and potential UK involvement. The UK government is reportedly prepared to evacuate British nationals from Tel Aviv once airspace re-opens for civilian flights, showing how the UK is taking the situation very seriously.</p>

          <p>A Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, marking the third such passage in the past year. This transit occurred shortly after a Chinese fighter jet approached a Japanese patrol plane over the Pacific. The move is seen as a warning to China, which continues to exert pressure on Taiwan, with Japan joining the U.S. and others in asserting freedom of navigation in international waters. The Japanese government has not officially acknowledged the transit, but it reflects a shift in stance amid Beijing's growing assertiveness.</p>

Trump stated that Powell is costing the United States "hundreds of billions of dollars" by not cutting rates, repeating his previous criticisms of the Fed chair. He also suggested that interest rates should be 2.5 points lower to save money on Biden's short-term debt. Powell has maintained that the Fed is well-positioned to wait for more economic data before making any policy adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that offsetting the carbon emissions from the reserves of the world's 200 largest oil and gas companies would require planting a forest the size of North America. The researchers analyzed the economic and ecological challenges of afforestation as a means of balancing carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. The study found that the land use and financial requirements make such a project unviable, and the researchers noted that the cost of afforestation would cause nearly all fossil fuel companies to lose value. The study suggests that reducing carbon emissions is more effective than relying solely on carbon offsetting.</p>

          <p>Airbus has taken center stage at the Paris Air Show with significant orders and new model announcements, while Boeing maintains a low profile due to ongoing business challenges. Airbus secured nearly $21 billion in orders, including deals with AviLease, ANA, and LOT, while Boeing has refrained from major promotional activities. The show highlights the strong demand for new aircraft, with both Airbus and Boeing having backlogs extending to 2031 and 2032, however, the firm has made few press announcements while it says it is focused on its customers and the investigation into the causes of the crash.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing injuries and prompting strong condemnation from Israeli leaders. Israel's defense chief accused Iran of war crimes and vowed to hold Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accountable. The missile attack resulted in damage to the Soroka Medical Center and other residential buildings, and the attack prompted a warning about cluster bombs fired by Iran. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed a response, and Israel has intensified attacks against strategic targets in Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, derives its name from the combination of the words "June" and "nineteenth." The name originates from June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, and informed the last group of enslaved people of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. Celebrations of Juneteenth include parades, parties, concerts, and educational workshops, and the holiday serves as a reminder of the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

          <p>The national conversation around the clean energy and net zero transition has become dominated by cost, and as the UKâ€™s largest charging network, with over 250,000 customers, Pod knows that more than anything, people want to manage their costs, which are only getting higher in an ongoing cost of living crisis. Greener options need to be simple and affordable, rather than another thing for people to worry about, and for many, the increase in their home electricity bills can be a concern when making the move to an EV. New options such as subscription models are key to more of us embracing EVs in a cost-effective way, with the launch of a new subscription offering that removes significant upfront costs of around Â£1,000 to install a home charger. Not only does a subscription spread the initial cost outlay, but included in the offering is cashback to cover the costs of up to 7,500 miles of charging, thatâ€™s the average mileage UK drivers cover each year, helping to offset the increase to home electricity bills.</p>

          <p>Arif Ahmed of the Office for Students (OfS) stated that students should expect to encounter shocking and offensive views at university as part of the educational process. The OfS has published guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech under a new law taking effect in August. The National Union of Students UK (NUS UK) criticized the guidance as unnecessary, while Universities UK welcomed the clarification and pledged to support compliance. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to protect free speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failures to do so.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.25% but hinted at future cuts, which could come as soon as August, with inflation remaining above the Bank's target rate. Governor Andrew Bailey said interest rates remain on a gradual downward path but warned that the world is highly unpredictable. There are concerns that the conflict between Israel and Iran, a major oil producer, could send energy costs higher and drive overall prices up, which would impact further rate decisions. The bank marginally lifted its expectations for the UK economy but said that underlying growth was weak. (not investment advice)</p>
