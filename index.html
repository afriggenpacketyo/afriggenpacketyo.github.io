          <h2>Trump Administration Faces Lawsuit Over Student Visa Terminations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 05:02:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration faces a lawsuit regarding the termination of legal statuses for 133 international students, with a U.S. District Court in Georgia granting temporary restraining orders. The ACLU and other groups filed the lawsuit, claiming Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), making the students deportable. The lawsuit alleges that ICE's actions coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, despite not violating their status, with many students nearing graduation or enrolled in work programs. The judge ordered the administration to notify the court upon compliance and barred the use of plaintiffs' identities outside the lawsuit, with a hearing set for Thursday. Optimism score must be a multiple of 5, so we are using 50.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 05:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists reveals a significant majority believe the U.S. is rapidly transitioning from a liberal democracy towards authoritarianism. The Bright Line Watch survey indicates a sharp decline in the rating of American democracy since President Trump's election, with scholars citing concerns about government interference with the press, punishment of political opponents, and checks on executive authority. While some scholars disagree, many specializing in democracy and authoritarianism are troubled by Trump's attempts to expand executive power. Competitive authoritarianism, as seen in countries like Hungary and Turkey, is a concern, involving the erosion of checks and balances by a democratically elected leader. </p>

          <p>Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) have made progress in treating advanced Parkinson’s disease using stem cells. In a phase 1 trial, donated stem cells were used to create neurons and transplanted into the brains of 12 Parkinson’s patients, resulting in noticeable improvements, especially in the high-dose group, which reported 2.7 hours of additional "on time" each day. The FDA has approved a phase 3 clinical trial with a larger patient group to take place in the first half of 2025, based on the success of the phase 1 trial. This therapy could potentially slow disability, stop progression, and improve motor function in Parkinson's patients. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to address the conflict between local school boards' authority over curriculum and parents' religious objections to certain materials. The case centers on Montgomery County, Maryland, where a school board approved storybooks with LGBTQ+ characters to promote tolerance. Some parents objected, citing conflicts with their religious beliefs and requested opt-outs, but the school board found accommodating these requests logistically difficult. The court will consider whether forcing exposure to these materials violates the Constitution's guarantee of free exercise of religion, balancing parental rights with the school's responsibility to provide a broad education. </p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly investing in gold ETFs to hedge against geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty caused by trade wars. Gold's 33% gain this year has outperformed other asset classes, with Chinese gold ETFs attracting significant inflows. The shift towards gold reflects a broader trend of investors seeking safe-haven assets amid concerns about the global order and the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy. This trend indicates a potential shift in investment strategies, with gold potentially replacing U.S. Treasuries and the dollar as a preferred haven for investors. </p>

          <p>Kenyan President William Ruto's state visit to China signals a strategic shift as Western support wanes and Beijing seeks to build a Global South alliance amid rising US tariffs. Ruto is expected to seek funding for key infrastructure projects, including the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) extension and a major highway project. This visit marks a departure from Ruto's initial West-leaning stance, driven by a failure to secure Western funding and challenges posed by the US tariff war. With traditional ally the United States imposing trade tariffs and pulling aid, Ruto is seeking new markets, project financing and investors from China. </p>

          <p>China's economy shows signs of improvement due to the government's stimulus package implemented in September 2024, with year-on-year GDP growth reaching 5.4% in the first quarter. Policymakers have acknowledged falling demand as a major problem, particularly in the real estate market, where a collapsing price bubble has impacted local government revenues and consumer spending. To alleviate pressure on local governments, the central government has allowed them to expand debt financing, while the central bank maintains faster credit growth with caution about lowering policy rates. Stabilizing property and stock markets is seen as crucial to mitigating the slowdown in consumer spending. </p>

          <p>The NFL draft is being reimagined with proposals to address the lack of agency players have over their careers. One idea involves flipping the draft order, rewarding teams closest to the playoffs with top picks instead of the worst-performing teams. Another suggestion is a lottery system for non-playoff teams, similar to the NBA, to prevent tanking and add excitement. Waiving the eligibility rule could allow players to be drafted earlier but stashed until they are eligible to play. A salary pool system would give teams a pool of money to negotiate with prospects, allowing players to choose the best environment and contract. </p>

          <p>The US State Department has advised countries to avoid using Chinese satellite services, citing concerns that they could be used to gather military information and sensitive intelligence. A leaked memo reveals that the US is asking countries to ban satellite services from "untrusted suppliers, such as those from China." The memo suggests that working with Chinese space providers could advance Beijing's foreign policy goals and risk the transfer of sensitive information to the Chinese government. Officials are also advised to warn that Chinese satellite companies may create a monopolistic, Beijing-controlled market. </p>

          <p>The climate crisis is exacerbating the global housing crisis, with climate change-driven disasters leading to skyrocketing housing prices in affected cities. Extreme weather events and natural disasters are changing the appeal of neighborhoods, with high-income individuals moving to higher elevation areas, displacing low-income residents. Post-disaster, housing becomes even more expensive, with prices jumping significantly after events like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria. Ensuring affordability and climate resilience requires expanding housing stock, shifting housing density toward low-risk areas, and implementing climate-forward retrofitting measures. </p>

The funding will also be used to build a new manufacturing center to support Roche's expanding portfolio of next-generation weight loss medicines. This move follows similar investments from other pharmaceutical companies amid threats from President Donald Trump to end the industry's exemption from import tariffs. </p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar plunged as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates. Trump's criticism, combined with his plans for tariffs, has driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all experienced significant declines. The dollar index also fell to its lowest level since 2022, while the price of gold hit a new all-time record high as investors seek safe-haven assets. </p>

This appears to surpass BYD's recent announcement of a charging system that could add about 400 km in range in about 5 minutes. If proven feasible on a larger scale, CATL's technology could help alleviate consumer concerns about electric vehicle range and convenience.

The last ceasefire collapsed a month ago when Israel resumed bombing Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the failure to keep it going. The official said that Hamas has signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon at the national and regional level. </p>

The government said the plot aimed "to sow total chaos" and was to culminate in an assault on the presidency on April 16.
