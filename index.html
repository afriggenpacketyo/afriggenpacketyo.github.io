          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in injuries to at least 19 people and the death of two individuals. The ship, which was on a goodwill tour, reportedly experienced mechanical issues, leading to the collision. The masts of the ship were severely damaged, and all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were briefly closed for inspection. Authorities are investigating the incident, and the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a full inquiry into the crash to determine the cause and prevent future occurrences, with the city promising a thorough investigation into the episode.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees who fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo following the 1994 genocide have returned to Rwanda, facilitated by the UN refugee agency. The repatriation occurred after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of eastern Congo, prompting many refugees, mostly women and children, to seek return to their homeland. The returnees were transported to a transit center for assistance and reintegration support. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and the UNHCR, aiming to address the long-standing displacement caused by regional conflicts and instability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic tour in the Middle East has underscored a shift in US foreign policy, with Israel seemingly taking a backseat as the administration focuses on brokering deals with Gulf nations. Trump's actions, such as engaging with Syria's new leader and seeking agreements with Iran and Yemen, have occurred without significant involvement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While the US maintains its historic ties with Israel, this new dynamic reflects a focus on economic and strategic interests in the Gulf, potentially altering the traditional US-Israel relationship and raising concerns among Israeli officials. Despite assurances from the Trump administration, the shift has prompted discussions about the future of US-Middle East relations.</p>

          <p>Despite surveys indicating that most British citizens regret Brexit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces substantial opposition from the national news media regarding his efforts to strengthen ties with the European Union. Some outlets have labeled the upcoming summit with EU leaders a "surrender summit," reflecting a deep-seated resistance to closer integration. The tabloid media, which largely supported the campaign to leave the European Union, is actively criticizing any moves towards rapprochement. Starmer's efforts are further complicated by the rise of anti-immigration sentiment and the need to balance relations with both Europe and the United States, as some media outlets continue to portray the EU as a semi-mythical threat.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine intensifies its efforts to recruit more soldiers amid the ongoing war with Russia, the military is working to increase the number of women in service. Despite government initiatives allowing women to serve in combat roles, deeply rooted stereotypes and sexism persist within the armed forces. Lieutenant Kateryna, the only female combat pilot in the Ukrainian military, faces daily challenges and doubts about her abilities. While the military has implemented gender equality training, many women remain marginalized and underutilized, highlighting the need for further cultural shifts within the ranks to fully integrate and support female soldiers.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, marked by a summit in London. The meeting is expected to yield a defense and security agreement to fortify European military security, especially as the United States recalibrates its global role under the Trump administration. The summit will also address economic cooperation, with Britain aiming to ease trade controls, particularly on food exports. The UK is looking to find a place in the European schemes, while some EU countries, notably France, want to limit British participation.

          <p>The demand for live shows in China is spurring a surge in tourism spending, as fans travel across the country to attend in-demand concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling tickets with discounts on hotels, dining, and tourist attractions, aiming to boost domestic consumption. This strategy aligns with Beijing's economic agenda to promote internal spending amid trade tensions. With domestic consumption high on Beijing’s economic agenda this year as trade tensions make export growth less reliable, local governments are bundling spots at popular shows with discounted hotel, dining and tourist bookings to encourage people to buy more than a ticket.</p>

          <p>In Minneapolis, Minnesota a 1993 crime scene investigation into the murder of 35-year-old Jeanie Childs revealed bloody bare footprints, which were a rare clue. The police determined that the footprints belonged to the killer because the victim was wearing socks. Years later, in 2015, DNA was found on the comforter, a towel, a washcloth, a T-shirt, and on the bathroom sink. Investigators then turned to investigative genetic genealogy and found a match to Jerry Westrom. Westrom was found guilty and given a life sentence, though his lawyers continue to maintain his innocence.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, the American-Israeli hostage recently freed from Hamas captivity, thanked President Trump in an emotional phone call. Alexander, who was held hostage for over 580 days, told Trump that he was the sole reason for his release. The phone conversation, released by the White House, has garnered widespread attention and praise. Alexander's release was the result of intensified US diplomatic pressure and negotiations, with Trump making the case a top priority. The Alexander family expressed their gratitude to Trump and the negotiation team, calling the outcome a miracle.</p>

          <p>In Farmersville, Illinois on Thanksgiving Day in 2021, a first date turned deadly when Leslie Reeves was murdered and Chris Smith was left barely conscious after being shot. Crime scene investigator Josh Easton said there was blood everywhere and that it was one of the most horrific crime scenes he'd ever seen. Suspicions turned to Leslie Reeves' ex-boyfriend, Bobby Tarr, and in February 2019, Jerry Westrom was arrested and charged with the murder of Jeanie Childs.</p>

Springsteen described the administration as corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous, urging those who believe in democracy to resist authoritarianism. This followed a threat from Trump to Springsteen to keep his mouth shut until he returned to the country. The Boss is unbothered by the president’s threats.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes have devastated parts of the Midwest and South, resulting in at least 26 deaths across multiple states. Kentucky was particularly hard hit, with 18 fatalities reported, and significant damage to homes and infrastructure. Missouri also experienced severe impacts, including fatalities and widespread destruction in St. Louis. The storms, part of a broader weather system, have prompted emergency responses and resource mobilization. The National Weather Service is facing staffing shortages amid this increased storm activity, raising concerns about forecasting and warning capabilities. This is not the first time this year that Kentucky has been hit hard by severe weather, so the state is no stranger to disaster.</p>

          <p>In a bid to scare potential military service dodgers, a local government in China has detailed the punishment dealt to a young man who the authority said had refused to serve because of personal preference. The 20-year-old surnamed Liu had signed up voluntarily in January and in March was assigned to an armed police force, the Jishui county government in Jiangxi province said on Monday. According to the statement, Liu is now banned from working as a civil servant or for state-owned enterprises, and for the next two years, he cannot travel abroad, study, open a business or enjoy preferential loan policies.</p>

          <p>Day turned to night in northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois on Friday as a rare dust storm shrouded the skies. A dark cloud suddenly brought near-zero visibility conditions on Friday afternoon to major highways, including Interstates 55 and 57 in Illinois, leading the National Weather Service to fire off a series of warnings about “dangerous, life-threatening” conditions on roads. This is not common at all, and the soil moisture in the area was at only 2 to 5 percent, making it among the driest ever.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a major military operation in the Gaza Strip to pressure Hamas to release remaining hostages. The operation follows days of intensive strikes across the territory that killed hundreds of people. The operation also comes as U.S. President Trump concluded his trip to the Middle East without a visit to Israel. There had been hope that Mr. Trump's visit to the region could increase chances of a ceasefire deal or the resumption of humanitarian aid to Gaza, which Israel has prevented for nearly three months.</p>
