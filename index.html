          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during a 45-minute phone call that upcoming bilateral tariff talks should be productive, with a potential in-person meeting at the Group of Seven summit in Canada next month. The call, initiated by the U.S., precedes further ministerial-level discussions in Washington led by Japan's top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. This comes amid escalating trade tensions between the two nations, emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial outcome. The discussions are set against a backdrop of recent economic data, including Japan's inflation acceleration in April and G7 finance chiefs demonstrating unity despite tariff disagreements.</p>

However, a comprehensive review led to the restoration of classes, acknowledging their effectiveness in training fire chiefs in leadership, management, and investigation techniques.

          <p>Black South Africans have responded with a mix of anger, disbelief, and humor to President Trump's claims of white farmers being persecuted in South Africa. Trump's offer of expedited resettlement for white South Africans in the U.S. as "refugees" has been met with jokes and satire, highlighting the legacy of apartheid and the ongoing inequality faced by Black people. Despite President Ramaphosa's attempts to address economic issues during his White House meeting, Trump continued to make false claims of genocide against white farmers. The jokes often stem from the perception that Afrikaners are used to a life of privilege made possible by Black workers.</p>
