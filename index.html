        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zara owner Inditex reported first-quarter revenues slightly below expectations, with €8.27 billion compared to the predicted €8.39 billion. Net income also fell slightly short of estimates, coming in at €1.3 billion. The company noted a slowdown in summer sales growth, increasing by 6% at constant currencies from May 1 to June 9, compared to 12% in the same period last year. CEO Óscar García Maceiras had previously attributed a slowdown in demand to uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. This performance reflects broader economic uncertainties impacting consumer spending in the fashion retail sector. The optimism score is 65.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is facing a confidence vote in parliament after a defeat in the presidential election, where right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party and U.S. President Donald Trump, won against Tusk's candidate. Tusk called for the vote to rally support for his pro-European coalition and address his government's inability to deliver on key reforms, such as reversing judicial reforms and advancing abortion rights, which were blocked by the outgoing President Andrzej Duda. Opposition leaders are seizing this moment to challenge Tusk's leadership, with some suggesting his downfall is imminent. The political turmoil underscores the challenges Tusk faces in implementing his agenda. The optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>Saburo Kita, an 82-year-old Japanese man, spoke at a U.N. event about disability rights, detailing how he was forcibly sterilized at age 14 under Japan's now-defunct eugenics protection law, which was in effect from 1948 to 1996. The law permitted authorities to sterilize people with intellectual disabilities, mental illnesses, or hereditary disorders without their consent. Kita, who received compensation from the government following a Supreme Court ruling that deemed the law unconstitutional, shared his experience as a "painful secret" and expressed his desire to prevent similar suffering. He hopes to raise awareness and understanding of the lasting impact of eugenics-motivated surgeries. The optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>Following an ICE operation at the Ambiance store, businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District are experiencing a significant decline in customers.
