          <p>Alan Yentob, the BBC's long-serving arts broadcaster and documentary maker, has passed away at the age of 78. Throughout his career, Yentob interviewed a variety of cultural figures, including David Bowie, Maya Angelou, and Grayson Perry, for TV series like Omnibus, Arena, and Imagine. He also held positions such as controller of BBC One and Two, as well as creative director and head of music and arts. BBC director-general Tim Davie called him a "creative force and cultural visionary" who championed originality, risk-taking, and artistic ambition, and his wife described him as "curious, funny, annoying, late and creative in every cell of his body." The article reflects on his significant contributions to the BBC and the arts world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government has termed the move a "new dawn for rail," but has refrained from promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and investing in infrastructure. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that she could not promise lower ticket prices, citing the Â£2bn annual taxpayer subsidy for running the trains. The BBC's Peter Henley was among the first passengers, although he had to transfer to a rail replacement bus at Surbiton due to engineering works.</p>

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion, has never reached the final of the French Open, but her performance in this match positions her as one of the tournament favorites, and she could face Zheng Qinwen or Iga Swiatek later in the tournament.</p>

          <p>An attack on a Palm Springs fertility clinic has brought attention to the fringe intellectual movement of anti-natalism. The suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus, identified as a pro-mortalist, detonated his car, resulting in his death and injuries to others. Anti-natalism posits that procreation is immoral due to the inevitability of suffering, and it has gained traction online with concerns about climate change and AI. The article explores the variants of this ideology, including efilism, and the connection to real-world violence, as Bartkus was associated with a woman who died in an apparent assisted suicide.</p>

          <p>The American economy has faced significant chaos over the past half-decade, including a pandemic, recession, inflationary spiral, and trade war. Despite these challenges, corporate profits are high, the jobless rate is low, and new businesses are flourishing. However, the article suggests that this resilience may be wearing off, with businesses now facing unstable tariff rates, bond-market swings, and rising import costs. The author discusses how governmental responses to the pandemic, such as low borrowing costs and financial support to families and companies, played a key role in economic strength.</p>

          <p>An essay explores the diminishing presence of young, straight, white male writers in contemporary literary fiction, a space historically dominated by them. The author, Ross Barkan, argues that while there's been a positive shift towards including previously marginalized perspectives, the unique experiences and perspectives of young men are being lost. He suggests that young men may be less interested in fiction or that publishers are less interested in their stories. Barkan also notes that the modern novel isn't addressing the complexities and struggles of young men today, including issues of alienation and anger.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed 2026 budget includes cuts that could lead to bigger food bills for seniors and higher utility costs for consumers. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which helps low-income seniors access nutritious food, would experience a significant reduction in funding. Additionally, cuts to the Department of Energy could hinder clean-energy initiatives, potentially increasing gas and electricity prices. Finance experts are concerned that these changes will negatively impact vulnerable populations.</p>

The policy, introduced in 2017, prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Rayner also denied being behind a leak of a memo suggesting child benefit payments be clawed back from wealthier families.</p>

          <p>A potential tax bill could undermine the clean energy sector by terminating key tax credits for renewable energy facilities. This legislation could significantly slow down the deployment of clean energy, potentially reducing it by 57% to 72% over the next decade. Companies are also restricted from claiming tax credits if they receive "material assistance" from prohibited foreign entities, mainly targeting projects that source materials from China. The legislation is seen as a major setback for President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and could result in job losses and increased electricity costs.</p>
