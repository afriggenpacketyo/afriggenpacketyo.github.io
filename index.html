          <p>Slovakia and Hungary have voiced strong opposition to the European Commission's plan to phase out all Russian gas, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas imports by the end of 2027. These nations, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy supplies, argue that the EU's proposal is a "serious mistake" that would harm their economies and energy security. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico described the plan as "economic suicide," warning of higher energy prices for consumers. The EU aims to achieve full energy independence from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, although nearly 19% of its gas imports still came from Russia in 2024.</p>

          <h2>AI Reanimates Agatha Christie for Online Writing Course, Sparking Ethical Debate</h2>

          <p>Agatha Christie has been digitally resurrected to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro, using AI to create her likeness based on her writings and archival interviews. This has stirred a debate about the ethics of using AI to recreate deceased figures, particularly regarding consent and the potential for misrepresentation. While Christie's family estate has approved the project and insists that only her own words will be used, some ethicists argue that it is still a form of deepfake, as Christie herself cannot consent to the course or its content. The article explores the balance between honoring an artist's legacy and the ethical implications of using AI to simulate their presence.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second smartphone forensics expert testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search about hypothermia occurred after John O'Keefe's body was found, contradicting the defense's claim. Jessica Hyde's testimony supported previous evidence, stating the search happened at 6:24 a.m., not 2:27 a.m. The defense attorney questioned Hyde's reliability and methodology, highlighting O'Keefe's phone's unsecured handling post-recovery. Read has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, manslaughter, and fleeing the scene, alleging she did not strike O'Keefe.</p>

          <p>Amid Donald Trump's trade war, economists and activists are debating the future of global capitalism, with some arguing for reform and others for complete replacement. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warns of a world becoming unhinged due to inequality and climate change. While some conservatives advocate for rebuilding American capitalism, leftists propose degrowth and a focus on local services. The challenge lies in balancing growth with environmental sustainability and addressing inequalities in a system that has faced numerous crises and criticisms throughout its history.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are employing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world's largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to detect water ice at the moon's south pole. The study estimates that ice comprises no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil, existing as fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground in permanently shadowed regions. These findings aim to aid in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a China-led research base on the moon.
