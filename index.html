          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released from detention, asserted that President Trump's administration would not silence him. Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained during his citizenship interview under a rarely used law, which allows the government to revoke visas if the Secretary of State believes someone could pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." Mahdawi, who led protests against the Israel-Hamas war, denies allegations of antisemitism and argues his detention violates his First Amendment rights. A judge ordered his release, citing substantial claims that his detention was retaliation for protected speech, and an appeals court will review his and fellow activist Rumeysa Ozturk's cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has experienced a significant loss of tax auditors following cost-cutting measures implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), according to a Treasury Department report. Nearly one-third of IRS tax auditors have left the agency through layoffs or deferred resignation, which could impact the government's ability to collect revenue from wealthy taxpayers and corporations. Experts warn that reduced auditing capabilities may lead to decreased tax compliance among high-end taxpayers, ultimately costing the government billions in lost revenue. The Biden Administration grew the IRS significantly, but DOGE's efforts are rolling back those gains, which may not make sense given the potential revenue loss.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a State Supreme Court race, marking a significant legal victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. The ruling rejects Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin's attempts to discard thousands of ballots, with the judge stating that changing election rules post-election would violate voters' due process rights. The case, which has ping-ponged through state and federal courts, has raised concerns about future efforts to overturn election results. Riggs declared victory, stating she is proud to continue upholding the Constitution as North Carolina's Supreme Court Justice.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected a key claim President Trump put forth to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans. The memo states that spy agencies do not believe Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro controls the Tren de Aragua gang, contradicting Trump's assertion. This release further undercuts the administration's rationale for using the wartime statute and calls into question its criticism of media coverage. The Justice Department had even opened a criminal investigation into leaks related to the story, but the declassification proves that the material should have been public from the start.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has rebuked Donald Trump's tariffs policy, warning it will trigger a "price shock" and possible shortages, leading to public pressure to change the approach. Pence also criticized the White House's "wavering" support for Ukraine and asserted that Vladimir Putin "doesn't want peace." He expressed disappointment with Trump's decision to pardon individuals involved in violence against law enforcement officers on January 6, 2021. Pence called Canada “a great ally, whose soldiers have fought and died alongside Americans in every war since world war one”.</p>

          <p>Utah is attempting to reverse the decline of the Great Salt Lake, which has lost over half its water, leading to concerns about public health, the ecosystem, and the economy. State lawmakers have invested in water conservation, but critics argue that the efforts are insufficient and slow-paced. While a recent year of heavy snow has temporarily stabilized the lake's decline, reaching a healthy elevation requires significant water use cuts. The state faces challenges in balancing the needs of agriculture, real estate development, and the environment.</p>

The incident highlights the dangers of maritime smuggling, which is a risky alternative for migrants seeking to avoid heavily guarded land borders.

The filing avoids addressing the merits of the case, which challenges FDA decisions that expanded access to mifepristone.
