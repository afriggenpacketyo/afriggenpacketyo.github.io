            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as the new vice minister of commerce and top representative for international trade negotiation, replacing Wang Shouwen, as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate. This move is seen as potentially aimed at de-escalating tensions, given Li's extensive experience in trade issues within the Ministry of Commerce. The appointment comes as both sides have increased tariff pressures, with the U.S. stating that China needs to make the first move towards a trade deal. Li's background includes serving as China's representative to the World Trade Organization and other international organizations.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is set to announce its ruling on the legal definition of a woman, marking the end of a legal battle between the Scottish government and a women's group. The verdict will determine how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England, and Wales, specifically impacting the interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act. The core issue is whether 'sex' refers to biological sex or the 'certificated' sex recognized by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, potentially affecting single-sex spaces, equal pay, and sports events. The ruling will have significant implications for transgender people and the broader debate on gender issues.</p>

The report comes amid fragility in global chip stocks due to concerns about potential impacts of U.S. tariffs on the semiconductor supply chain.

            <p>Hong Kong's post office will cease shipping small parcels to the United States in response to Washington's plan to impose tariffs on low-value parcels from the city. The U.S. government is ending a customs exception that allowed tax-free entry for shipments under $800, instead imposing a 120% tariff starting May 2. Hongkong Post stated it will not collect these tariffs and will suspend non-airmail parcel services, as sea shipments take longer. This move highlights Hong Kong's position caught between trade disputes between the U.S. and China, particularly after the imposition of a national security law by Beijing.</p>

            <p>Conservationists are warning that the UK's rarest wildlife is being driven closer to extinction due to intense grass fires, which have destroyed habitats and killed endangered species. The fires, exacerbated by dry conditions and high temperatures, have impacted areas vital for birds like hen harriers and golden plovers, as well as mammals like water voles. Conservation charities are calling for increased funding to restore peat bogs and better monitoring of controlled burns to mitigate the devastating impact on the environment. The increasing frequency and intensity of these wildfires pose a significant threat to the UK's already depleted natural ecosystems.</p>
