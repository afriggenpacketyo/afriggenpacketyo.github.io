          <p>This New York Times article discusses how President Trump and his family are allegedly profiting from his position, engaging in deals with foreign entities and individuals, including a cryptocurrency business and investments directed through Jared Kushner. The author argues that this behavior, while brazen, is not unprecedented, citing the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of funds from foreign regimes. The article highlights the need for legislation to prevent politicians and their families from engaging in foreign lobbying and deals, and calls for future administrations to prosecute any illegal enrichment activities. The article emphasizes that American politicians have been susceptible to foreign influence for a long time. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe, driven by environmental concerns and efforts to compete with short-haul flights. The author contrasts this with the United States, where funding for public infrastructure is being slashed and long-distance travel is becoming increasingly car-dependent. The article argues that America's focus on cars has led to decreased happiness and mental health, while investment in rail networks and subway systems remains limited. The author suggests that revitalizing railways could offer an alternative way forward, promoting community, connection, and a shared purpose. </p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election amid heightened security concerns due to the war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S. commitment to European security. The leading candidates are Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, a liberal, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. The election is also a test of the strength of the far-right candidate SÅ‚awomir Mentzen, who blends populist rhetoric with libertarian economics. The outgoing president has used his veto power to hamper the prime minister's agenda, so the election's outcome is poised to potentially end such a standoff. </p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" episode details the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, where a rare clueâ€”bloody, bare footprintsâ€”led investigators on a decades-long search for her killer. Investigators initially suspected Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but he had an alibi. Years later, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that kept repeating itself throughout the crime scene, and investigative genetic genealogy eventually linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom. Westrom denied knowing Childs, but his DNA and footprints matched those found at the scene, leading to his arrest and conviction. </p>

Robert Tarr, Reeves' ex-boyfriend, was convicted of the murder and attempted murder, and Smith has been recovering since the shooting.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, moving away from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include Nairobiâ€™s mega-highway, a stalled railway, and Zambiaâ€™s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. During Kenyan President William Rutoâ€™s visit to China, he sought Chinese funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), with Chinese financiers contributing 40% of the cost and gaining exclusive rights to construct and operate the railway for at least 25 years. </p>

          <p>Romania is holding a new presidential election after the previous one in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities in campaign financing and organization.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charge current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. These changes are part of Newsom's May revision to address a $12 billion state budget deficit, partly attributed to President Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. While Newsom claims he will not remove anyone from Medi-Cal, the plan aims to save California $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year. The proposal requires legislative approval before the new fiscal year begins on July 1. </p>

While the U.S. maintains its alliance with Israel, Trump's actions, particularly concerning Iran and Syria, diverge from Netanyahu's preferences. This shift reflects Trump's focus on broader regional interests and economic opportunities, potentially reshaping long-standing alliances and strategies. </p>
