            <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance has agreed to a $300 million settlement to resolve allegations that it unlawfully filled millions of invalid prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances over a decade. The Justice Department claimed Walgreens pharmacists knowingly filled prescriptions showing clear signs of illegitimacy and pressured workers to prioritize speed over legal protocols, leading to the illegal distribution of opioids. While Walgreens denies liability, the settlement dismisses the government's complaint and Walgreens' declaratory judgment action. The opioid crisis has caused over 700,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, leading to tariffs on goods imported from China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

This year's event marked the first time the White House solicited corporate sponsorships, with companies like YouTube, Amazon, and Meta providing financial support.

The event also comes as egg prices in the United States reached record highs earlier this year due to an outbreak of avian flu that has forced farmers to kill off millions of egg-laying hens.</p>

            <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is traveling to Washington D.C. to attend the IMF spring meetings and discuss a potential trade deal with the US amid concerns over newly imposed tariffs. President Trump has implemented a 10% tariff on all imports into the US, including from the UK, and a 25% levy on car imports, prompting the UK to seek a trade agreement to mitigate the impact. Reeves will meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss the deal and encourage European finance ministers to increase defense spending and support Ukraine.

The biggest donor was multinational food company Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, which gave $5 million despite having very little political contribution history at the federal level in recent years.

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering around 22%, consolidating debt into a lower-rate loan can be beneficial. Consolidating can lead to significant savings and easier financial management, especially for those with good credit who can secure favorable loan terms. However, the effectiveness depends on credit profile; those with poor credit may not qualify for significantly lower rates. A thorough assessment of one's financial situation, including debts, credit score, and spending habits, is crucial before pursuing debt consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has effectively shuttered the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, leading to the termination of 130 federal mediators. This has fueled concern among unions and employers about who will help ease labor conflicts, as the agency plays a vital role in settling disputes and avoiding labor unrest. The terminations have disrupted negotiations between major Southern California grocery chains and unions representing their workers. California and several other states are exploring how they might fill the gap.</p>

            <p>DHL will temporarily stop shipping packages over $800 in value to U.S. consumers due to new, more stringent U.S. customs rules. The company cited the 10% tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, which has led to increased scrutiny by U.S. customs inspectors and shipping backlogs. The new policy applies to packages sent from any foreign country to U.S. consumers. The changes to U.S. customs rules are part of President Trump's effort to overhaul the government's global trade policy.</p>

            <p>Tesla stock closed down 5.8% as investors worried about the company's upcoming first-quarter earnings report. Questions surrounding CEO Elon Musk's return to Tesla's offices from Washington, D.C., and the status of the company's cheaper EV are swirling ahead of the report, with the stock down nearly 44% year to date. Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe has seen Musk — and Tesla's brand — suffer. Protests both in the US and abroad at Tesla showrooms are growing, as are acts of vandalism on Tesla EVs.</p>

            <p>Asian crime networks behind the multi-billion-dollar cyberscam industry are expanding their operations globally, according to a UN report. These networks target victims through investment, cryptocurrency, romance, and other scams, often forcing trafficked workers to con people online. The activity, previously focused in Southeast Asia, is now expanding to South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and some Pacific islands. The UNODC urged the international community to act, warning of "unprecedented consequences" if the issue is not addressed.</p>

            <p>As Google heads back to the courtroom for its remedies trial, the company is arguing that the U.S. needs the company in its full form to compete with China and uphold national security. The Justice Department has called for Google to divest its Chrome browser unit and open its search data to rivals. Google said such a move would "hamstring how we develop AI, and have a government-appointed committee regulate the design and development of our products." Google is one of a number of U.S. tech companies trying to fend off the Trump administration's antitrust pursuits.</p>
