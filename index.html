          <p>China's military is emphasizing the importance of large-scale, centralized deployment of unmanned combat systems for future intelligent warfare, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region amidst tensions with the U.S. The PLA Daily highlights the necessity of innovative organization and application of unmanned systems, stressing their decisive role in conducting precision strikes. Referencing efforts by Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. to build unmanned systems, the article argues that mass deployment has become a consensus in military modernization. The article suggests that the next phase of competition will focus on rapidly concentrating systems, personnel, and pioneering new deployment models to build a technologically advanced unmanned force. The US-China competition in UAVs and unmanned systems is a key aspect of their strategic and technological rivalry. Optimism is tempered by the potential for escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a greater-than-expected contraction of 0.3% in April, influenced by rising taxes for businesses, increased household bills, and a significant drop in exports to the US. Employers faced higher National Insurance contributions, and households saw increases in water, energy, and council tax bills. The introduction of tariffs by the US President Trump led to the largest monthly fall in US exports on record. These figures were released shortly after the chancellor Rachel Reeves outlined spending plans aimed at stimulating growth, which included funding increases for the NHS and defense, but budget cuts elsewhere. This economic downturn raises concerns about the UK's financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for France to manufacture cutting-edge chips, positioning the country as a key tech hub in Europe amidst concerns over reliance on foreign tech firms. Macron highlighted that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France, emphasizing the potential for France to produce semiconductors in the 2nm to 10nm range. Macron is advocating for partnerships with companies like TSMC or Samsung to establish local factories. He also mentioned a deal between Thales, Radiall, and Foxconn to explore setting up a semiconductor assembly and test facility in France, aiming to convince them to locate manufacturing in France. This initiative aligns with France's broader AI infrastructure buildout, supported by significant private investments.</p>

          <p>Oman's foreign minister announced that Iran and the United States will hold a sixth round of negotiations in Muscat this Sunday regarding Tehran's nuclear program. The announcement comes amid heightened regional tensions, with the U.S. drawing down non-essential staff from its Middle East embassies due to potential unrest. These talks are a diplomatic priority, potentially leading to the U.S. easing economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on uranium enrichment. Failure to reach a deal could escalate tensions in the Middle East, affecting Iran's economy and potentially leading to military actions or Iran's withdrawal from cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.</p>

US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to meet with Iranian officials in Muscat to discuss Iran's nuclear program. President Trump stated that Americans were advised to leave the region due to potential danger, reiterating the US stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons. The US hopes to reach a deal to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, while Israel favors a military approach.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda broadcasts along the border with North Korea, marking a step toward easing tensions between the divided nations. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the move to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. This decision is intended to reduce military tensions and ease the burden on South Koreans residing in border areas. The South had resumed these broadcasts in retaliation for North Korea's trash-laden balloons, a form of psychological warfare, but now seeks to improve relations with Pyongyang.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Beijing is focusing on developing domestic alternatives like Huawei to build its AI chip ecosystem. U.S. curbs not only restrict access to advanced chips but also vital technology for creating AI chips. Beijing has invested heavily to address these gaps, but faces challenges across the semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips. While Huawei has made progress with its Ascend chips, the company still lags behind Nvidia, and faces limitations due to restrictions on chip manufacturing equipment.</p>

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, widow of the late Lord Leon Brittan, has criticized the decision to drop an investigation into the officer who led an inquiry into false claims of sexual assault against her husband. She expressed that her trust in the Met Police and the police watchdog has been severely undermined by the handling of the case. Lord Brittan was falsely accused of being part of a paedophile ring in Westminster, and the investigation into these claims cost the Met Police Â£2.5m. Lady Brittan feels that her husband's legacy has been permanently tarnished despite his name being cleared.</p>

The Mace B cruise missile launch site, one of four built in the 1960s, was opened to the public for the first time this spring. The United States occupied Okinawa from 1945 to 1972, and the deployment of nuclear weapons increased during the Cold War. The Onna site is the only place where the past presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa can be seen firsthand, with the missiles having the capability to strike China and parts of the Soviet Union.</p>
