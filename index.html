          <h2>Hegseth Installs Signal on Pentagon Computer for Secure Messaging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 04:09:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the encrypted messaging app Signal installed on a computer in his Pentagon office to facilitate secure communications where personal cellphones are restricted. This setup allowed Hegseth to send and receive instant messages more easily within the building, where cell service is unreliable. Cables were installed in early March to connect a private computer to Signal, improving communication accessibility for the defense secretary within the Pentagon. The use of Signal highlights the need for secure communication channels within government offices. </p>

          <p>Ofcom has finalized rules requiring tech firms to implement robust measures protecting children online, including age verification and algorithm adjustments to filter harmful content. Platforms hosting pornography or content promoting self-harm must take action by July 25 or face substantial fines. The new regulations also mandate streamlined reporting systems and designated personnel accountable for children's safety. While some critics express concerns about the rules' ambition, Ofcom asserts these measures will significantly enhance online protections for children in the UK, subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are surging as investors seek safe-haven assets amid trade turmoil, while U.S. Treasuries and the dollar decline.

The traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down, as gold's inflation-hedging properties and independence from national economic policies make it more attractive during times of uncertainty.
