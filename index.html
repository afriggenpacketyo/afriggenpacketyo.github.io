          <h2>Blood Test for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Set to Launch in US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:51:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new blood test developed by Fujirebio Holdings is poised to revolutionize Alzheimer's diagnosis in the United States, becoming available in late June at approximately 50 research institutions and hospitals. The FDA-cleared test detects amyloid, a key protein associated with Alzheimer's, in individuals aged 55 and older exhibiting symptoms. This method offers a significantly less expensive and invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially reducing the diagnostic process from weeks to roughly 30 minutes. The advent of this blood test is expected to facilitate wider access to novel Alzheimer's treatments like Leqembi and Kisunla, which have previously been hampered by the cumbersome diagnostic procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed a bill proposing a tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tips for eligible tipped workers. Spearheaded by Sen. Ted Cruz, the bill extends business tax credits for payroll taxes on tips in beauty and spa services. This initiative aims to provide financial relief to approximately 4 million workers in tipped occupations, such as waiters, waitresses, barbers, and cosmetologists, where tips are a customary part of their income. The bill stipulates that employees with compensation exceeding $160,000 in the prior tax year would not be eligible for the tax deduction, and the measure is estimated to cost $110 billion in federal revenues over 10 years.</p>

Passed in 2021, the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law allows China to prosecute entities that enforce sanctions against it and seek compensation for losses incurred.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned following public outcry over his statement about never having to buy rice due to receiving it as gifts, a remark that angered citizens facing rising rice prices. This resignation comes amid Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government grappling with low approval ratings and ahead of critical Upper House elections, with former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro succeeding Eto. Soaring rice prices, driven by weather and protectionist policies, have fueled discontent, pushing Ishiba's cabinet approval rating to a low of 27.4%. The agriculture ministry's attempts to curb prices by releasing government stockpiles have proven ineffective, while demand has increased due to high tourist footfall.</p>

          <p>New satellite analysis reveals that the world's tropical forests experienced unprecedented destruction in 2024, with fires overtaking agriculture as the primary cause. Approximately 67,000 square kilometers of old-growth forests were lost, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, equivalent to the emissions of the European Union. The Amazon rainforest suffered significantly due to a record drought, leading to uncontrolled fires and raising concerns about a potential "tipping point" where the forest could irreversibly decline. However, South East Asia saw a decrease in forest loss due to government policies and community efforts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country's air defense system, similar to Israel’s Iron Dome.

Trump claims the Golden Dome will intercept missiles from any location, including space, and be operational before the end of his term. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the project as a "game changer," while Gen. Michael Guetlein will oversee its development.</p>

          <p>Malaysia, a crucial player in the global semiconductor industry, is caught in the crosshairs of President Trump’s trade policies, creating uncertainty for its ambitious plans to build high-end chips. American companies have been operating manufacturing facilities in Malaysia for over five decades, making the country a significant exporter of semiconductors to the United States. However, potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could undermine Malaysia's efforts to move into chip design and advanced manufacturing. While Malaysia has attracted investment from companies like AT&S and Nvidia, the industry remains wary of the impact of tariffs on supply chains and consumer prices.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights that record-breaking global temperatures in 2024 contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with fires destroying 2.8 million hectares of old-growth forest, primarily in the Amazon rainforest. The hot, dry conditions also fueled larger blazes across South America, especially in Bolivia and Colombia, while primary forest loss spiked in Africa's Congo Basin. While countries like Indonesia and Malaysia managed to reduce forest loss through prevention efforts and stricter laws, experts warn that climate change is creating a feedback loop where fires are becoming more intense.</p>

          <p>The media's focus on young men allegedly driving the rise of the far right is empirically flawed and misses a more significant shift in public opinion among young people, according to a recent article. While surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, young women stand out as the more politically interesting demographic, turning in ever greater numbers towards the left. This trend presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, such as climate change and strengthening the welfare state, rather than pandering to the reactionary politics of the far right.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Chris Van Hollen engaged in a heated exchange during a Senate hearing as Van Hollen criticized Rubio's handling of issues ranging from humanitarian assistance in Sudan to deportations to El Salvador. Van Hollen expressed regret for voting to confirm Rubio, accusing him of betraying his principles. Rubio defended his actions and ridiculed Van Hollen for visiting a deportee in El Salvador, falsely claiming he drank margaritas with a gang member and human trafficker. Van Hollen interjected, objecting to the unsubstantiated claims.</p>

          <p>Japan's government will introduce fast lanes dedicated to South Korean visitors at Tokyo's Haneda and Fukuoka airports in June to mark the 60th anniversary of normalized diplomatic ties. South Korea will implement similar measures for Japanese travelers at Gimpo in Seoul and Gimhae in Busan to promote mutual exchange. This marks the first time Japan has established lanes limited to passengers of a specific nationality. The fast-track entry system will be available to visitors who have traveled between Japan and South Korea within the past year, subject to completing necessary procedures.</p>

          <p>New emails reveal how a top aide to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Kent, pressured analysts to revise an intelligence assessment on the relationship between Venezuela's government and the Tren de Aragua gang. Kent sought to insulate President Trump and Gabbard from criticism regarding the administration's claim that Venezuela controls the gang. The final memo still contradicts Trump's claim used to justify deporting accused gang members. Kent's actions have raised internal concerns about the politicization of intelligence analysis, while his defenders argue he was trying to present a more complete picture of the intelligence community's knowledge.</p>

The execution took place exactly 13 years after the attack on Harris, who suffered extensive burns and described the suspect before her death.

          <p>Japan's exports growth slowed for a second consecutive month as the country grapples with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Exports to the U.S. fell for the first time since December of last year, dropping 1.8% from a year ago, and Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to 780.6 billion yen. Japan is subject to a 25% levy on its auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., as well as the 10% baseline tariffs imposed by Trump on most trade partners. Experts anticipate that net exports will continue to negatively impact GDP growth in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
