          <p>The Trump administration has initiated the construction of a new, privately funded $300 million ballroom at the White House, a project that required the complete demolition of the historic East Wing. This development has drawn criticism, particularly as it coincides with significant foreign policy engagements. President Trump is also preparing for a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC Summit amid escalating trade tensions. Additionally, the administration is expediting the delivery of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia under the AUKUS agreement to counter Chinese influence, though Trump has expressed mixed views on the necessity of the deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery to remove between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets he had swallowed, leading to the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, reportedly purchased from the online retailer Temu, formed dangerous chains inside his intestines, causing pressure necrosis. This case highlights the significant dangers of small, high-powered magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys but can cause severe internal injuries if ingested. Despite a ban in New Zealand, these products remain easily accessible online, prompting renewed calls for greater public awareness and stricter enforcement of safety standards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the stock market reaching all-time highs, some financial experts observe a declining appeal in passive investment strategies centered on S&P 500 index funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). The primary concern is a lack of diversification, as the technology sector now constitutes a record 35% of the index, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight. Consequently, investors are increasingly looking towards small-cap stocks for broader market exposure. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, recently hit an all-time high, outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire heir and a major financial supporter of Donald Trump, has been identified as the anonymous donor who gave $130 million to help pay U.S. troops during the ongoing government shutdown. The donation, which President Trump had praised without naming the donor, has raised legal questions regarding a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which restricts government agencies from accepting certain voluntary services or funds. Mellon has a history of significant political contributions, including over $165 million to support Republican candidates and $53 million for Texas Governor Greg Abbott's border wall fund.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur is set against a backdrop of escalating rivalry between the United States and China, forcing member nations into a difficult diplomatic position. While the official agenda covers economic integration and regional stability, the underlying tension revolves around trade disputes, territorial claims in the South China Sea, and technological competition. Many Southeast Asian countries are attempting to maintain a delicate balance, fostering economic ties with China while relying on security partnerships with the U.S. This balancing act is becoming increasingly challenging as both superpowers pressure nations to choose a side.</p>

          <p>French energy giant TotalEnergies has announced its decision to lift the "force majeure" and restart its $20 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique. The massive energy infrastructure project, Africa's largest private investment, was suspended in 2021 following a deadly jihadist attack on the site. The move signals a significant step toward stabilizing the region and unlocking Mozambique's vast natural gas reserves. However, the restart is contingent on final approval from the Mozambican government, and security concerns in the region persist despite the absence of major attacks on the project site.</p>

The campaign's messaging focuses heavily on opposing Donald Trump, a strategy that appears to be resonating in a state where the former president has low approval ratings.

          <p>A new report indicates that the Manhattan condo market has experienced a period of stagnation, with over one-third of condos sold between mid-2024 and mid-2025 trading at a loss. The median price per square foot has remained largely flat over the past decade, a stark contrast to significant price increases in most other parts of the U.S. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses for sellers are likely even greater. The luxury segment, particularly properties over $10 million, has been an exception, continuing to see strong returns driven by cash buyers and wealth concentration. (not investment advice)</p>
