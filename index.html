          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has extended his support to two fathers participating in the London Marathon to honor their daughters, who tragically died in the Southport attack. Sergio Aguiar and David Stancombe are running to raise funds for projects dedicated to their daughters' memory. Their daughters, Alice Aguiar, Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Bebe King, were victims of an incident that occurred last July during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.

          <p>Jay Leno addressed the infamous incident where Jimmy Kimmel criticized him on "The Jay Leno Show" in 2010, stemming from the "Tonight Show" controversy with Conan O'Brien.

However, Kimmel later revealed that the two comedians had reconciled after Leno reached out following the heart surgery of Kimmel's son.</p>

The letter, written on April 10, 1912, the day Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton, was purchased by an anonymous buyer. The letter is considered "prophetic" because it records Col Gracie telling an acquaintance he would "await my journey's end" before passing judgement on the "fine ship".</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating placing caps on the number of international students to address the growing crisis of unaffordable housing. Politicians are considering this measure to reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, aiming to lower prices.

While many investors are relieved by signals of easing trade tensions, Mullaney is holding cash, believing the fallout from trade hostilities may be too entrenched to avoid economic consequences.

The Conservative party, led by Pierre Poilievre, has adjusted its message to "Canada First," but faces criticism for being perceived as "Trump lite."</p>
