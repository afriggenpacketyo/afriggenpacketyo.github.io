        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources report that the Israeli military conducted a strike targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, with the United States not participating in the operation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Israel informed the U.S. that the action was deemed necessary for self-defense, emphasizing that Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel. An IDF spokesperson said the military launched a preemptive, precise, combined offensive based on high-quality intelligence to strike Iran's nuclear program in response to ongoing aggression against Israel. Dozens of Israeli air force jets reportedly struck multiple military targets, including nuclear sites in different areas of Iran, marking what they called the first stage of the operation. The situation remains tense, with potential retaliatory actions anticipated. Optimism for regional stability is notably low given the escalatory nature of the event.</p>

          <p>Douglas McCarthy, the singer of the influential U.K. electronic industrial band Nitzer Ebb, has passed away at the age of 58. The band confirmed the news, but did not specify a cause of death. McCarthy founded Nitzer Ebb in Essex, and the band's harsh, electronic style played a formative role in the industrial wave of music. He revived the band in 2007 and released a solo album in 2012, while facing health issues later in life.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy that delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells, significantly halting the progression of myeloma. The treatment, belantamab mafodotin, has shown to halt the blood cancer for nearly three times longer than current therapies while reducing side effects. Patients like Paul Silvester have described the therapy as "life-changing," allowing them to enjoy a normal life. The drug works by binding to cancerous cells and releasing a toxic payload, killing the cancer from within.</p>

          <p>Caravan buyers are reporting instances of being misled, financially exploited, and even threatened by holiday parks, according to a BBC investigation. Buyers claim they received misleading information about potential rental income, faced steep and unexpected increases in site fees, and were pressured to sell caravans back to the parks at significantly reduced prices. Some buyers have also reported instances of intimidation and threats when seeking legal advice. The holiday park sector is described as largely unregulated, leaving buyers vulnerable to unfair practices.</p>
