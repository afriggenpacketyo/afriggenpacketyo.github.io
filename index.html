          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 11:29:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, President Donald Trump threatened to impose "severe tariffs" of up to 100% on Russia if a deal to end the war in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. This announcement comes as the administration plans to provide more "sophisticated" military equipment to aid Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression. The statement underscores increasing U.S. frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin and signals a potential major shift in U.S. policy toward the ongoing conflict. Trump's remarks set a tense backdrop for discussions about NATO's role and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is navigating a turbulent period just over two months into his term, marked by internal coalition disputes and external pressures. In a recent interview, he expressed strong disapproval of the Israeli government's actions in Gaza and defended his handling of a contentious vote on Constitutional Court judges that nearly fractured his coalition. His government also faces challenges from potential new U.S. tariffs on EU imports, which Merz warned could "cut to the bone" of the German economy. These issues have overshadowed his administration's initial goals of renewal and reform.</p>

          <p>A wildfire at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and between 50 to 80 other structures, including administrative buildings and a water treatment facility. The Dragon Bravo Fire exhibited extreme behavior, fueled by strong winds, leading to the significant loss of infrastructure. The incident has prompted calls for an investigation into fire management strategies, as authorities initially used a "confine and contain" approach. Meanwhile, smoke from separate Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the Upper Midwest, highlighting a widespread season of fire-related environmental challenges across North America.</p>

          <p>China's export growth accelerated in June, rising 5.8% year-over-year, as companies rushed to place orders ahead of a potential renewal of steep U.S. tariffs. While exports to the United States fell by 16%, this was a marked improvement from the 34.5% drop in May, indicating a temporary surge in activity during a 90-day tariff truce. Despite this short-term recovery, analysts remain cautious about the long-term outlook, expecting export growth to slow as high tariffs are likely to persist. China has successfully diversified its trade, with significant growth in exports to Southeast Asia and Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to choose the best certificate of deposit (CD) term. Some experts suggest that short-term CDs currently offer more competitive rates, as banks anticipate future rate drops. Others argue for locking in today's higher yields with longer-term CDs before rates potentially fall. For those uncertain, a CD ladder—spreading deposits across multiple terms—is recommended as a strategy to balance access to funds with securing favorable long-term rates. High-yield savings accounts are also presented as a flexible alternative to CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its sub-postmasters through a mutual model. The proposal is part of a "fresh vision" aimed at rebuilding trust and transforming the organization's culture following the devastating Horizon IT scandal, which led to hundreds of wrongful convictions. While exploring new ownership structures, the government stated it does not plan to reduce the current network of over 11,500 branches. The consultation also seeks input on expanding services, particularly banking, as traditional lenders close high street locations.</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Guardian argues that the current surge in measles cases to 25-year highs in Europe and 33-year highs in the U.S. is a direct consequence of the anti-vaccine movement. The article traces the modern distrust of vaccines back to Andrew Wakefield's discredited 1998 study linking the MMR vaccine to autism. It laments that despite the scientific community debunking the claims, a generalized suspicion of vaccination took hold and has now led to a resurgence of a preventable disease. The author concludes that vaccination is a concrete example of our reliance on collective rationality and care.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent social media post threatening to revoke the U.S. citizenship of actor Rosie O'Donnell has been widely dismissed by legal experts as unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment establishes that all persons born in the United States are citizens, and the president has no authority to unilaterally strip a native-born citizen of this right. The threat is the latest development in a long-running feud between Trump and O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. While the government can denaturalize citizens under specific circumstances like fraud, experts affirm this does not apply to native-born Americans.</p>

          <p>Newly released family court documents detail the long history of parental failures by Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who were recently convicted of gross negligence manslaughter in the death of their fifth child, Victoria. The papers reveal a pattern of evading social services, refusing essential healthcare for their children, and prioritizing their own relationship over their children's needs. A judge had previously ruled that Gordon likely caused Marten to fall from a window while pregnant. The documents paint a picture of a "fiercely united" couple engaged in a "struggle against a non-existent opponent," ultimately leading to their four older children being placed permanently in care.</p>

          <p>The victories of Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon have brought controversy, as both singles champions have previously served suspensions for banned substances. Although authorities accepted that both cases were due to unintentional contamination and cleared them of wrongdoing, the situation has raised concerns about the sport's image. Some players have questioned the consistency and transparency of the anti-doping system, suggesting top players may receive preferential treatment. In response, Sinner acknowledged the difficulty of the past months but said the wins were "very special" for both him and Swiatek.</p>

Court documents from his 1990 sentencing in Florida detail the brutal, hours-long attack. Gordon served 20 years of a 40-year sentence before being deported to the UK.

          <p>A new analysis indicates that Republican-led legislation signed by President Trump will cause a significant surge in U.S. electricity costs, with the largest impact felt in Republican-leaning states. By eliminating tax credits and support for cheaper renewable energy sources like wind and solar, the bill is projected to increase average household energy costs by $170 annually by 2035. States like Missouri, Kentucky, and Texas are expected to see the highest spikes. This outcome contrasts with Trump's campaign promise to lower energy costs, as the legislation forces greater reliance on more expensive fossil fuels. (not investment advice)</p>

The article points to questionable decisions by the camp, such as building cabins in a flood-risk area, and scrutinizes the delayed emergency response from local and state authorities.

          <p>As gold trades near record highs, financial experts anticipate its price will hold steady or climb further in the second half of 2025. Key drivers include persistent global geopolitical tensions, which bolster gold's status as a safe-haven asset, and "sticky" inflation that encourages investors to seek a hedge for their purchasing power. Consumer behavior, with new buyers entering the market, is also expected to support prices. While some analysts are optimistic about new highs, others believe significant price increases will depend on the emergence of new economic risks. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction, with one senator calling the beds comfortable.
