          <p>McDonald's reported a 3.6% decline in U.S. same-store sales, the largest domestic drop since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to bad weather and cautious consumer spending. The company's overall same-store sales fell 1% across all markets, impacted by comparisons to last year's Leap Day. Despite these challenges, McDonald's plans to focus on value meals and new menu items to attract customers. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, slightly above expectations, but revenue missed estimates at $5.96 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will no longer be able to compete in women's football in England starting June 1. This decision follows the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines a woman based on biological sex. The FA stated that it reviewed its policies after a material change in law and determined that only those born biologically female will be permitted to play in women's football. This decision marks a shift in the FA's approach to transgender inclusion in the sport.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, leading to an increase in its full-year adjusted earnings guidance, as its insurance business showed signs of improvement.

CVS CEO David Joyner mentioned that the company had prepared for higher medical costs and is monitoring the potential effects of President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Aetna, CVS's insurer, saw improvement in its medical benefit ratio, indicating higher profitability due to stronger performance in its Medicare business.</p>

The author, Vardanyan's child, calls for the United States, particularly President Trump, to intervene and secure the release of the Armenian political prisoners.

          <p>Moustafa Bayoumi argues that the Trump administration governs through a pattern of mistakes, using errors to conceal or backtrack on unpopular authoritarian policies. Examples include mistakenly sending a threatening letter to Harvard University and erroneously deporting an Salvadorian man with a deportation protection order. The article also cites instances of sending incorrect notices to Ukrainian refugees and using flawed calculations for tariff policies. Bayoumi concludes that the administration's constant errors and blunders are dangerous and reflect a lack of competence rather than political genius, leading to low approval ratings.</p>

          <p>As federal funding for research diminishes under the Trump administration, private companies are stepping in to fill the void, although experts caution that these efforts cannot replicate the scope and depth of federal support. Start-ups like Evvy are funding trials to address areas such as women's health research, which has been particularly affected by the cuts. While these initiatives are commendable, health policy insiders emphasize that they cannot replace the extensive resources previously provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH has experienced significant budget cuts and staff reductions, impacting various areas of medical research.</p>

          <p>Lawyers are raising concerns that the Trump administration's actions to strip collective bargaining rights from federal employees represent a broader attack on US labor unions. Trump issued an executive order exempting collective bargaining at several federal departments, affecting over 1 million workers, citing national security. Rushab Sanghvi, AFGE general counsel, views this as part of authoritarian efforts against labor unions, and believes the cases are likely to end up in the Supreme Court. Union leaders, including AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler, have condemned the executive order as union-busting and a direct attack on the right to collective bargaining.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic podcast discusses the potential destabilization of the American financial system due to President Trump's pro-crypto policies. Annie Lowrey explains that Trump's push to integrate crypto into government and mainstream banking could lead to weakened regulations and increased risks for taxpayers. She fears that Trump is shifting risk away from crypto investors and onto the American public, potentially leading to a financial crisis similar to 2008. The podcast also explores the potential for public corruption, scams, and state-sponsored theft within the crypto markets.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams has stated that he found the BBC's response to his complaint regarding a Spotlight program to be insulting. Adams is suing the BBC for damages at the High Court in Dublin over allegations that he sanctioned the murder of Denis Donaldson in 2006, which he denies. Adams' lawyers sought an apology and compensation, but the BBC rejected these remedies, stating that the program was a product of responsible journalism. Adams claimed that the BBC "doubled down on the allegations" and dismissed efforts to resolve the issue.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article summarizes key headlines, including the U.S. economy shrinking in the first quarter due to messy trade data, the Senate rejecting a measure to undo Trump's tariffs, and the U.S. announcing a deal to share Ukraine's mineral wealth. The article also covers the release of a Columbia student arrested at a citizenship interview, fears among India's Muslims after a Kashmir attack, and the rescue of a dachshund after 529 days. The chaotic start to President Trump’s second term roiled the economy at the beginning of the year, as consumers and businesses scrambled to react to a stream of tariff announcements and policy shifts.</p>

          <p>This DW article explores the significance of sport for the Nazis, who prioritized physical education to promote health and performance for a productive national economy and military fitness. Individual sport was secondary to the collective, emphasizing strength and fortitude. The Nazis initially rejected international competitive sport but later used the 1936 Olympic Games for propaganda purposes. Boxing was particularly promoted in schools, and sporting activities for women were influenced by their role as mothers and housewives. Jewish athletes were gradually excluded from sports clubs and associations.</p>

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a well-known pottery firm in Burslem, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The directors announced the firm's voluntary liquidation, citing increased energy costs and falling sales as contributing factors. The closure marks another blow to Stoke-on-Trent's pottery industry, with industry commentators and union representatives calling for government support. The firm's history dates back to 1897, and it had been based at its current site since 1913, gaining recognition for its colorful depictions of wildlife and geometric patterns.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and the United States signed a deal granting the U.S. control over a share of Ukraine's future revenue from natural resources, an agreement Kyiv hopes will ensure continued U.S. support and a cease-fire with Russia. The agreement involves creating a joint investment fund and addresses President Trump's concerns about the U.S. providing Kyiv with a blank check. Ukraine managed to remove the idea of repaying wartime assistance with its mineral wealth and kept the door open for joining the European Union, but the deal lacks a security guarantee.</p>

He still believes reaching the $1 trillion cost-cutting goal is "possible" but "really difficult," citing bureaucratic inertia and political will as major obstacles. Musk emphasized the need for significant changes to overcome the default of federal bureaucracy, which aims to increase expenses annually.</p>

State money is also supporting faith in education through vouchers, allowing taxpayer funds to be used for private religious schools. The article also touches on state efforts to expand religion in public schools, such as putting Bibles in classrooms and displaying the Ten Commandments.</p>
