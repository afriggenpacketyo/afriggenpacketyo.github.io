          <p>The New York Yankees observed a moment of silence to honor NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, who was killed in the recent Midtown Manhattan shooting. Before their game against the Tampa Bay Rays, the team paid tribute to the 36-year-old officer, who was a married father of two with a third child on the way. The Yankees organization extended condolences to his family and the other victims of the shooting, which occurred in an office building that also houses the NFL's headquarters. The tribute highlights the community's mourning for the officer, who was praised for his sacrifice in the line of duty.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting in a Manhattan office building, Mayor Eric Adams described the event as an intentional and twisted act of violence. He revealed that surveillance footage showed the gunman's methodical approach and that a note left by the shooter mentioned CTE, though the exact motive is still under investigation. The attack resulted in four deaths, including an off-duty NYPD officer and a Blackstone employee, and one injury. Adams praised the building's security measures for saving lives and used the tragic event to advocate for stricter national gun control legislation to prevent future violence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean Combs' legal team has filed a motion for his release from federal custody ahead of his October sentencing, proposing a $50 million bond and strict travel restrictions. Although acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering, Combs was convicted on prostitution-related charges. His lawyers argue for his release due to exceptional circumstances, including threats of violence at the detention center and the assertion that his conduct was part of a consensual "swinger" lifestyle. The motion claims Combs is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, despite past allegations and video evidence of domestic violence.</p>

The negotiations aim to prevent a return to escalating tit-for-tat tariffs that have impacted both economies. While discussions covered key issues like rare earths and trade imbalances, officials emphasized that no deal is finalized until the president gives his sign-off. (not investment advice)</p>

Sleeping in contacts, even for a short nap, dramatically increases the risk of a corneal ulcer, a serious infection that can lead to permanent vision damage or even eye loss. The expert also advises against exposing lenses to any nonsterile water, including from showers or taps, as it can trap bacteria against the cornea. To maintain eye health, proper lens hygiene is crucial, and using protective eyewear during activities like home projects is highly recommended.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old hiker, Angela Lin, was killed in Yosemite National Park after being struck by a falling tree branch while in the Tuolumne Grove of sequoias. The incident occurred while she was hiking with her partner, who reported hearing a loud crack before the limb fell. Lin, a software engineer from Mountain View, died at the scene despite attempts at CPR. The Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office has ruled the death accidental, caused by blunt injuries. The National Park Service is investigating the tragic incident, which serves as a somber reminder of the inherent risks in natural environments.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its 350-year history, a woman has been appointed as the UK's Astronomer Royal. Professor Michele Dougherty, a leading space scientist involved in a mission to Jupiter's icy moons, will now serve as the official astronomical adviser to the monarch. Professor Dougherty, who did not study science in secondary school, hopes her appointment will inspire more women and girls to pursue scientific careers. The historic role, once focused on maritime navigation, has evolved into one of the most prominent scientific voices in the country, promoting public engagement and international collaboration in astronomy.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to be cautious about design software company Figma's initial public offering, despite praising its business fundamentals. He noted that Figma is already set to go public at a high valuation, which could become excessively pricey if the stock surges immediately upon trading. While impressed by Figma's profitability, growth, and high-profile clients, Cramer raised concerns about weakness in the enterprise software sector and CEO Dylan Field's comments that AI investments could be a drag on efficiency for several years. The company is expected to be valued between $17.6 billion and $18.8 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest five-day strike by resident doctors in England is ending, but the underlying dispute with the government is far from resolved.

While talks have touched on non-pay issues like exam fees and working conditions, tensions remain high, with both the government and the union trading accusations. With public opinion showing signs of shifting, both sides have indicated a potential willingness to resume negotiations to find a path forward and avoid a continuous cycle of strikes.</p>

          <p>Atmospheric scientists are warning that air travel is set to become bumpier, with severe turbulence expected to double or triple in the coming decades due to climate change. Rising global temperatures are strengthening the jet stream and creating more intense thunderstorms, both of which are major causes of turbulence. While fatalities are extremely rare, injuries from turbulence are more common, and the increase could lead to more incidents and higher economic costs for airlines. In response, airlines are exploring better forecasting, new operational procedures, and advanced technologies to mitigate the effects and ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>Recent polling indicates that tax cuts are no longer as politically popular in the U.S. as they once were, with a majority of Americans opposing the latest Republican tax bill. This shift may be due to several factors, including a lower overall tax burden compared to past decades, rising income inequality, and a growing public awareness that tax cuts do not pay for themselves and contribute to the national debt. While voters are souring on cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy, it remains unclear if they would support broad tax increases, posing a future challenge for policymakers.

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious fruit, health experts caution that eating it in excessive amounts can lead to several negative side effects. Due to its high content of certain sugars (FODMAPs), overconsumption may cause digestive issues like intestinal stress, particularly for those with irritable bowel syndrome. The fruit also contains tyramine, an amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Additionally, its natural sugar content, though moderate, means that people with diabetes should be mindful of their intake to manage blood sugar levels effectively.</p>
