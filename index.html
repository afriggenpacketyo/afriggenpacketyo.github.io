          <p>China's leaders have declared their commitment to strengthening domestic consumption and technological self-reliance over the next five years, with an emphasis on quantum computing and hydrogen power. The announcement followed the "Fourth Plenum" meeting, which sets China's development goals. Vice Premier He Lifeng is scheduled to visit Malaysia for trade talks with the U.S., fueling anticipation for a potential meeting between the U.S. and Chinese presidents. Leaders also emphasized the need to balance consumption with effective investment, focusing on policies to support businesses and boost domestic demand. The article suggests a shift in China's approach to supply and demand, but doesn't signal immediate cash handouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on October 30th at the APEC Summit, marking their first in-person meeting since Trump's return to office. The meeting comes as a delicate trade detente between the U.S. and China nears expiration, with potential for renewed trade restrictions. Discussions are expected to cover tariffs, agricultural purchases, fentanyl flows, and geopolitical issues like Taiwan. Both sides are likely to seek a "reset" in their relationship, though deeper structural disputes may remain unresolved.

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a flexible, ultra-thin metasurface coating for stealth aircraft capable of withstanding high temperatures. The coating, detailed in a study published in Advanced Materials, is only 0.1 mm thick and can endure temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its tunable impedance makes it suitable for aerospace electromagnetic wave absorption. The research was led by Cui Guang and Liu Zhongfan from Peking University, along with Wang Huihui and Li Maoyuan. Liu's team previously made breakthroughs in large-scale graphene production.</p>

          <p>A bus fire in southern India resulted in the deaths of at least 20 people after colliding with a motorcycle. The motorcycle became lodged under the bus's fuel tank, causing an explosion and engulfing the vehicle in flames. Eighteen passengers escaped, but many were asleep when the fire started, and a jammed door may have contributed to the high death toll. This is the second deadly bus fire in India in recent weeks, raising concerns about public transport safety, and authorities have launched an investigation into the incident.</p>
