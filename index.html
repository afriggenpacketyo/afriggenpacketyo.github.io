          <p>With home prices and equity levels rising, homeowners may consider borrowing against their equity using a home equity loan or HELOC, especially given lower interest rates compared to other borrowing options. Borrowers should carefully assess their ability to repay the loan, considering factors like inflation and interest rate fluctuations. HELOCs have variable interest rates, while home equity loans have fixed rates, influencing repayment strategies. Homeowners should calculate monthly payment costs for both options and determine an amount they can comfortably afford, as the home serves as collateral.

          <p>A ban on single-use vapes in the UK is set to take effect, but a campaign group warns it's unlikely to reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to teenagers, as reusable models are similar to disposables. Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said new reusable vapes closely resemble single-use vapes in terms of design and accessibility. She argues that factors like bright colors and cheap prices, rather than disposability, drive teenage vaping. The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill aims to regulate packaging and advertising to further reduce the appeal of vaping to young people. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>
