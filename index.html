          <p>President Trump has signaled a significant escalation in addressing crime and homelessness in Washington, D.C., warning the city's homeless population to relocate immediately. This heightened rhetoric follows a recent assault on a former government official and is part of a broader effort to assert federal control over the city's public safety. Despite data showing a decline in violent crime, the administration announced an increased federal law enforcement presence. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized the administration's approach as hyperbolic and counterproductive, while acknowledging the need for federal cooperation.</p>

In response to the severe weather, USA Triathlon also canceled its national championships scheduled in the city.

The key sticking point remains territory, with Ukraine adamantly refusing to cede land, while Russia's demands remain firm.

          <p>A new biographical analysis, "Electric Spark," re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her identity as a witty, comic writer often obscures her profound religious concerns. The article posits that Spark, a Roman Catholic convert, used narrative structure and authorial omniscience to explore the relationship between God and humanity, particularly grappling with themes from the Book of Job. Her signature use of prolepsis, or revealing a character's fate early on, forces readers to focus on causality and divine will rather than suspense. This approach allowed her to investigate faith, free will, and judgment with a uniquely sharp and ironic touch.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have refuted suggestions in Nicola Sturgeon's upcoming memoir that Salmond himself may have leaked details of a sexual misconduct investigation against him. In an extract from her book, Sturgeon denies she was the source of the leak but speculates it would have been a "classic Alex" move. This has drawn sharp criticism from Salmond's Alba party colleagues, who called the claim a "fabrication" and renewed calls for a public inquiry into the government's handling of the complaints. The controversy highlights the deep and lasting rift between the two former leaders of the Scottish independence movement.</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas Originals culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On drew inspiration from huaraches, which are made by Indigenous artisans, but was reportedly produced in China without their partnership or credit. The controversy attracted high-level attention, including from Mexico's president, who criticized large companies for taking Indigenous designs. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in direct collaboration with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, aiming to broker an end to the war in Ukraine and fulfill a major campaign promise. The summit follows back-channel discussions led by envoy Steve Witkoff and comes after Trump increased pressure on Russia with sanction threats. However, the exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from the initial talks has sparked significant concern among European allies and in Kyiv. They fear a potential deal could involve territorial concessions to Russia at Ukraine's expense, undermining its sovereignty.</p>

The debate highlights the deep partisan divisions surrounding the practice, which has intensified as Texas Democrats fled the state to block a vote that would heavily favor Republicans in future elections, prompting threats of arrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," delves into literature's fascination with the trope of strange and mystical sisters. The novel, set in the 18th century, follows five sisters accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, and is told from the perspective of outsiders. This article analyzes how such sisterhoods have historically served as a test or foil for other characters, from Macbeth to fairy tales. While Purvis's novel engages directly with feminist subtext, the review notes it sometimes relies on familiar conclusions about persecution, yet still offers a fresh, visceral take on why femininity itself can be perceived as a threat.</p>

Combined with its stunning natural landscapes, from the Albanian Alps to the Adriatic coast, and a welcoming local culture, it presents an attractive option.
