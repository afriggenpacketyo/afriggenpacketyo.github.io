        <h2>The Overuse of Trauma Narratives in Popular Culture</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 10:00:51 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The article analyzes the prevalence of trauma narratives in recent popular culture, from memoirs to television and film. It argues that while using trauma to develop characters is not new, the overreliance on the “trauma plot” – where trauma is the central driver of the narrative – has become a tired trope.
