          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in the Hague, Netherlands, shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, though he later noted violations of the agreement. Trump aims to secure commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump's actions in Iran and his success in securing increased defense spending commitments from NATO members. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a key concern for NATO, with ongoing discussions about the alliance's stance toward Russia, with the U.S. urging restraint from both parties. The summit will address defense spending and the conflict in Ukraine. Optimism about allied defense spending efforts exists. The overall sense of stability is present despite ongoing conflicts. The optimism score is the result of a balanced assessment of the situation.</p>

The War Powers Resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying armed forces and mandates that military use end within 60 days unless Congress declares war or grants an extension.

          <p>Wildwood Devon, a conservation charity near Exeter, evacuated its wildlife park after two European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure. The bears headed straight for the honey store, consuming a week's worth of honey. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, were deployed, and police were notified. The bears remained calm and did not breach any public areas, and both were safely returned to their enclosure. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped.</p>

Starmer stated that the current welfare system is unsustainable and traps people on benefits, necessitating reform. Over 120 Labour MPs have signed an amendment to block the proposed cuts, which aim to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030. The government's proposals would tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip), requiring claimants to prove they need a higher degree of assistance.</p>

          <p>A senior correspondent at Vox discusses the Supreme Court's role in enabling ICE's alleged lawlessness, focusing on cases like HernÃ¡ndez v. Mesa and Egbert v. Boule. The article argues that these cases have undermined Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, which held that federal law enforcement officers who violate the Fourth Amendment may be sued for that violation. The author suggests that the Court's current majority appears determined to destroy Bivens, potentially emboldening officers to violate the Constitution. The article explores the implications of these legal developments on accountability for law enforcement misconduct.</p>

          <h2>ICE Detains Record Number of Immigrants, Nearly Half with No Criminal Record</h2>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is holding a record 59,000 detainees, with nearly half lacking a criminal record. This data contradicts assertions that the agency prioritizes arresting criminals. The detention level is at over 140% capacity, as Congress has allocated fewer beds than detainees. The Trump administration has expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administrations.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, explains the significance of Juneteenth, which commemorates the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they were free. She said that Juneteenth allowed enslaved people to celebrate their freedom and their identities, being African and American. She encourages everyone to visit a museum to understand the history and the lived experience of freedom. Dr. Jones said learning about the history behind Juneteenth helps us to understand collective ancestry, collective sacrifice, as well as being born in this time.</p>
