        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly, marking its largest one-day drop in over a year and reaching the lowest point since early October. This sharp decline to 6.29% was a direct market reaction to a weaker-than-anticipated August employment report, which eased concerns about aggressive Federal Reserve policies. The rate drop provides potential relief for homebuyers facing high property prices, reducing monthly payments on a typical home loan. However, it remains uncertain if this decrease is substantial enough to reinvigorate mortgage demand, which has recently been sluggish. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of over 40,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean as part of its intensified Operation Pacific Viper counter-drug initiative. The operations, which occurred over the last month, also resulted in the apprehension of 36 suspected smugglers. The agency released images from the missions, including one of a burning vessel that had been intercepted. This surge in enforcement aims to disrupt narcotics trafficking from South America before it reaches U.S. shores, complementing similar heightened operations in the Caribbean.</p>

During the announcement, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro described Tarpinian-Jachym as an innocent bystander and criticized the D.C.

Plaintiffs who challenged the law are appealing an overturned decision, with the earliest potential relief not expected until oral arguments in November. This legislation is part of a broader national trend, with over two dozen states considering or passing similar laws amid rising U.S.-China tensions. The concerns, initially focused on agricultural land, have expanded to encompass broader real estate ownership by foreign nationals.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is canceling its flight services in 12 U.S. cities, including a complete withdrawal from Northern California airports in Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, and San Diego. This move comes as the low-cost carrier, having filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time this year, seeks to eliminate unprofitable routes. The company cited poor demand for domestic leisure travel and adverse market conditions for its financial difficulties, which also led to pilot furloughs. Competitors like United and Frontier Airlines are already planning to add routes to capitalize on the service gaps left by Spirit.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers star running back Christian McCaffrey has been listed on the team's injury report with a calf issue just days before the start of the 2025 NFL season. This development raises concerns for the team and his fans, given his history with significant injuries. McCaffrey missed 13 games during the 2024 season due to separate calf and knee injuries, after also missing substantial time in 2020 and 2021. The running back was the league's Offensive Player of the Year in his last fully healthy season in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico to escalate its military campaign against drug cartels in the Caribbean. This move follows a recent lethal U.S. missile strike on a suspected drug-trafficking boat and a Pentagon report of Venezuelan military planes buzzing a U.S. warship. The deployment signals a significant military buildup in the region, which officials state is aimed at disrupting Venezuelan-led narcotics operations. Critics and former officials have expressed concern that this aggressive posture could lead to unintended consequences, including potential conflict with Venezuela.</p>

The piece highlights a key trait of long-term dissidents: the ability to persevere in the face of likely failure. It concludes by urging Americans to consider when they too must "put themselves on the line" to defend democratic principles, suggesting this fight is a lifelong commitment.</p>

          <p>This political analysis article critiques the Democratic Party's recurring strategy of labeling President Trump's controversial actions as mere "distractions" from his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues that this tactic, while referencing a genuine vulnerability for Trump, diminishes the seriousness of his more authoritarian moves, such as deploying the National Guard in cities. By framing these actions as stunts, Democrats risk implying they can be safely ignored. The article suggests this focus may reveal a lack of more effective messaging and could be distracting from other significant political vulnerabilities for the administration.</p>

If the winner chooses the lump-sum cash option, estimated at $826.4 million, there is a mandatory 24% federal withholding, immediately cutting the prize by nearly $200 million. However, because the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, millions more will be owed at tax time. State taxes could further reduce the prize, depending on where the winning ticket was purchased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching a historic $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows how a winner's location can dramatically affect their net winnings. After federal taxes are deducted, the final payout varies based on state income tax laws. States with no income tax, such as Florida, Texas, and Washington, offer the highest potential take-home amount. In contrast, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the annuitized payout reduced by over $160 million compared to tax-free states. The analysis also highlights which numbers have been drawn most and least frequently in the game's history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant cooling in August, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs, far below economists' forecasts of 80,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%. Adding to the concern, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its June figures downward, showing a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly decline since late 2020. This slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty, partly driven by the Trump administration's tariffs, making businesses hesitant to hire. The weak report increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion over ten years. The plan would award Musk 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization and mass-producing vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. This proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018. The board argues the new award is necessary to retain and incentivize Musk during a pivotal growth period for the company.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has surprise-released "Swag II," a 23-track follow-up to his "Swag" album from just two months prior. The new record largely continues in the same musical vein, featuring Bieber's vocals over indie rock and 80s R&B-influenced productions. This sound marks a departure from his earlier pop and EDM hits but is familiar to fans of his more experimental projects like "Journals." The album features collaborations with artists such as Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris, and continues to explore themes of marriage, fatherhood, and religion in his lyrics.</p>

Potts's chances are boosted by the recent retirement of rival Jamie Overton from red-ball cricket and an injury to Chris Woakes, potentially opening up a pace bowling spot in the Ashes squad.</p>

The layoffs are part of broader budget cuts after Congress eliminated $1.1 billion previously allocated to public broadcasting in July. In response to the financial strain, PBS has also slashed its overall budget by 21% and reduced the dues it collects from its 350 member stations. The funding crisis has left the future of many local public television stations uncertain as they appeal for public support to remain operational.</p>

An analysis by Washingtonian magazine suggests audiences are boycotting the premier arts venue in protest of Trump's new role as chairman and the installation of his loyalists in leadership. Prestigious upcoming performances, like the Stuttgart Ballet, are reportedly selling poorly, with some houses less than 20% full.

According to a report from NAIOP, a commercial real estate association, net absorption of industrial space was nearly flat in the first half of the year. While a recovery is projected for 2026, the sector's rapid growth, which was fueled by the e-commerce surge during the pandemic, has clearly come to a halt. (not investment advice)</p>
