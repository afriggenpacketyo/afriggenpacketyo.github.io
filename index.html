          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life for murdering her two children in Idaho, has been sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in Arizona. The convictions are for conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and for attempting to murder her niece's ex-husband. Prosecutors argued the motives were financial gain and her desire to be with her new husband, Chad Daybell, framing the plots within their "twisted" doomsday religious beliefs. During the sentencing, emotional victim impact statements from family members condemned her actions, calling her the true "family tragedy."</p>

The move has raised some concerns due to past instances of Grok generating controversial or false information, though the platforms express excitement. Proponents of prediction markets, including Musk, argue they are more accurate than traditional polls because users have a financial stake in the outcomes, reflecting the 'wisdom of the crowd.'</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have initiated a five-day strike after failing to reach a pay agreement with the government, creating a challenging period for the National Health Service (NHS). Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that while disruption is unavoidable, efforts are being made to minimize it and keep non-urgent services running. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that pay has fallen significantly in real terms over the last 17 years and that restoring it is essential. This is the 12th strike by resident doctors since March 2023, with previous walkouts leading to over a million canceled appointments.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that there were "shortcomings" in the mental health care provided to former England cricketer Graham Thorpe in the months leading up to his death. Thorpe, 55, died by suicide in August 2024 after struggling with depression following the loss of his job. The court heard that weeks before his death, Thorpe had told his wife he needed "help to end his life," but healthcare professionals did not perceive him to be in a crisis situation. The coroner noted that Thorpe had not been seen in person by mental health staff for over four months.</p>

          <p>Health officials in South Carolina have confirmed the death of a child from Naegleria fowleri, a rare amoeba that causes a severe brain infection. The exposure likely occurred at Lake Murray, a popular freshwater lake, during July. The amoeba thrives in warm freshwater and enters the body through the nose, leading to an infection with a fatality rate exceeding 97%. While the event is tragic, officials state there is no increased risk to the public as the organism is naturally occurring and not transmissible between people. This is the state's first reported case since 2016.</p>

          <p>The US military's presence at the southern border has significantly increased, with troops taking on a more central role in deterring migrant crossings under a Trump emergency declaration. Large sections of the border have been designated as militarized zones, allowing troops to apprehend individuals. With 7,600 personnel deployed, the mission utilizes armored vehicles and advanced surveillance to support Border Patrol. This expanded military role has raised concerns among legal experts about its alignment with the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>A collection of recent polls reveals increasing public rejection of President Trump's hardline immigration policies, particularly his strategy of mass deportations. Surveys from Gallup, CNN, and Pew Research show majority disapproval, with significant opposition among independent and Latino voters. The data, compiled by the organization America's Voice, suggests that while voters desire order at the border, they prefer a pathway to legal status for long-term undocumented residents over mass removal. This sentiment has grown stronger in recent months, indicating a potential political liability for the administration's current enforcement-heavy approach.</p>

          <p>The new Marvel film, 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps,' aims to inject a lighter, retro-futuristic tone into the franchise but struggles to find its joy, according to this article's review. While visually handsome with a capable cast including Pedro Pascal, the movie rushes past the team's family dynamic to focus on a grim, world-ending plot involving the planet-eater Galactus. This leaves little room for the character chemistry and playful banter that defined the original comics. The result is a film that feels muted and overly serious, failing to deliver the 'zip' and fun that was expected to revitalize the superhero genre this summer.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially opened its first combination diner and Supercharger station in Los Angeles, realizing a concept CEO Elon Musk first proposed in 2018. The two-story, 24/7 establishment features a retro-futuristic design, 80 charging stalls, and two large screens playing films for patrons. The restaurant serves classic American food to both EV owners and the general public, drawing large crowds shortly after its debut. The site also temporarily featured Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot serving popcorn, reinforcing the company's futuristic brand identity. The concept may be expanded to other cities if it proves successful.</p>

          <h2>An Examination of Why In-Flight Wi-Fi Service Remains Unreliable</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being available for two decades, in-flight Wi-Fi remains inconsistent, caught between being a miraculous convenience and a frustrating failure. The primary issue is not the Wi-Fi access points on the plane, but the connection from the aircraft to the internet, which uses either air-to-ground or satellite systems. While satellite technology is superior and becoming more common, many regional and short-haul jets still use the older, less reliable air-to-ground service. Airlines are slowly upgrading their entire fleets, a complex and costly process, but promise that consistent, free, high-speed internet should be standard by 2026.</p>

          <p>The prestigious journal 'Science' has formally retracted a controversial 2010 study that claimed to have discovered a bacterium capable of using arsenic to build its DNA. The finding, if true, would have expanded the known requirements for life. However, subsequent research failed to replicate the results, with critics arguing that the original experiments were likely flawed by contamination. The journal retracted the paper because the data did not support its key conclusions, though no scientific misconduct was alleged. The original study's authors disagree with the retraction, stating that scientific debate should not be grounds for pulling a paper.</p>

          <p>The United States and China engaged in a direct confrontation at a UN Security Council meeting regarding the war in Ukraine. The acting U.S. Ambassador urged China to "stop fueling Russia's aggression," accusing Beijing of supplying dual-use goods that contribute to Russia's war industrial base. In response, China's deputy ambassador accused Washington of shifting blame and creating confrontation, stating that China has never provided lethal weapons and strictly controls dual-use materials. The exchange highlights the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the role of China's economic support for Russia in the protracted conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Declaring a famine is a formal process guided by a specific, internationally agreed-upon system known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). For a famine to be officially declared, three distinct criteria must be met simultaneously: at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition, and the daily death rate from non-trauma causes exceeds two per 10,000 adults. Even if these conditions are met, the final declaration is made by high-level government or UN officials. This high bar means many people can be dying of starvation long before a formal famine is announced.</p>

His comments follow a deadline he set for August 1st to finalize a deal, after which a 35% tax could be applied to certain Canadian goods not covered by existing agreements. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated his country "will not accept a bad deal," and officials have downplayed the likelihood of an imminent agreement.

          <p>An eastern German state minister is advocating for the return of a Yazidi family who was recently deported to Iraq, a move that may have violated a court order. The family, including four children, was removed on a charter flight on the same day a court had lifted their obligation to leave the country. The deportation of Yazidis is highly controversial, as Germany's parliament has officially recognized the 2014 atrocities committed against them by the "Islamic State" as genocide. The case has drawn criticism from politicians and human rights groups, highlighting the precarious situation of Yazidi refugees in Germany.</p>

          <p>A new study has identified the world's most unaffordable housing markets, with five of the top ten located in the United States. The report classifies markets as "impossibly unaffordable" when the median home price is nine or more times the median income. Four California metropolitan areas—San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego—along with Honolulu, made the list. Hong Kong was ranked as the least affordable globally, with a price-to-income ratio over 14. The study attributes these high prices to land-use policies that restrict growth, contributing to a cost-of-living crisis for middle and working-class families. (not investment advice)</p>

The pizzeria, which shared a kitchen with a licensed THC-edible vendor, unintentionally used THC-infused cooking oil to prepare food over a three-day period in October 2024. At least 85 people reported symptoms of THC intoxication, including dizziness and anxiety, after consuming the food.
