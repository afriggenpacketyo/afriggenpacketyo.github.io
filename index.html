          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom, potentially easing investor concerns about global tariffs. The UK government has also suggested considering lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. The announcement follows Trump's earlier imposition of broad tariffs on US trading partners, many of which were later reversed or paused for negotiations, with the exception of the 145% levy on Chinese imports. A trade deal with the US is considered vital by Prime Minister Starmer's government, particularly after the UK recently struck a free trade agreement with India.</p>

          <p>The International Boxing Hall of Fame's induction process is under scrutiny as some deserving figures remain unacknowledged, while others with questionable achievements are celebrated. The article highlights Jermain Taylor, Kelly Pavlik, and Gerry Cooney as examples of fighters who have never been on the ballot despite notable accomplishments. The article also points to the omission of non-fighters like Alan Hopper, Cedric Kushner, and Al Haymon, who have significantly contributed to the sport. Ed Brophy, the president of the Hall of Fame, explains that anyone can suggest a name for the ballot, but the review and screening committees hold the real power in determining the final list.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's strategy of nurturing a relationship with President Trump appears to be paying off with an imminent trade agreement between the UK and the US, a significant political victory for Starmer. The details of the agreement remain unclear but the fact that Britain is the first country to conclude a deal with the United States after Trump imposed tariffs on other trading partners affirms the 'special relationship' between the two nations. Starmer has avoided criticizing Trump and has acted as a bridge between Europe and the US, even coaching President Zelensky on mending his relationship with Trump, according to the article. The deal could help buoy Britainâ€™s confidence amid faltering economic growth, but also presents potential hurdles with resetting trade relations with the European Union.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, as it reported its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company's forecast is based on current U.S. tariff rates, with President Shuntaro Furukawa noting that additional tariffs could decrease demand in the U.S. If prices need to be adjusted, duties could significantly impact profit, potentially costing tens of billions of yen. Nintendo delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. following the initial announcement of Trump's tariffs, as its consoles are manufactured in Vietnam, which faces substantial duties.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since the imposition of stiff tariffs on Americaâ€™s trading partners. The agreement, which could be a significant win for both countries, has been pursued since Trump's first term. Details of the agreement are not yet clear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm goods, and removing British taxes on US technology companies, though it is uncertain whether the agreement has been finalized.</p>

          <p>Maersk, a key indicator of global trade, has revised its global container market volume growth forecast downwards due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, including US-China trade tariffs. Despite reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, the company warned that the current level of US-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes. The company's 2025 profit guidance remains unchanged, but the revision in container volume growth reflects concerns about the impact of trade tensions on global trade.</p>

          <p>Burning fossil fuels significantly intensified the historic storms that caused widespread death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley in early April, according to a rapid analysis by climate scientists. The study found that human-caused climate change made the rainfall about 9% more intense and 40% more likely. The region's warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, driven by the climate crisis, further fueled the storm's moisture, leading to catastrophic flooding and tornadoes. The National Weather Service's forecasting and early warnings helped to save lives, despite facing major cuts and staff layoffs.</p>
