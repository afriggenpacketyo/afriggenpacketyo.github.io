          <p>The U.S. State Department is expanding its immigration crackdown by implementing continuous vetting for over 55 million visa holders, checking for legal violations that could lead to revocation and deportation. This policy now includes screening for "anti-American" views on social media. In a separate move, the administration has immediately halted the issuance of work visas for commercial truck drivers, citing safety concerns following a fatal crash involving a foreign national. These actions mark a significant tightening of immigration and visa policies under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Meta has reportedly entered a six-year agreement to spend over $10 billion on Google's cloud services, primarily for artificial intelligence infrastructure. This deal represents a significant win for Google Cloud as it competes with rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for major contracts. Despite being competitors in the online advertising market, Meta's extensive AI development needs require access to substantial cloud infrastructure, supplementing its own data centers and existing commitments with other providers. The partnership highlights the immense computational demands driving the current AI boom.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation for a new congressional redistricting plan in California, which will now go before voters in a November special election. The plan aims to make five Republican-held House seats more favorable to Democrats, directly responding to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas initiated at President Trump's urging. Democrats argue the move is necessary to neutralize the GOP's "power grab" and protect democracy, while California Republicans condemn it as an illegal, partisan strategy that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly down from the previous month but still higher than economists' forecasts. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in rice prices, which had previously surged. However, the "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also strips out energy prices, remained steady at 3.4%. These figures arrive as the central bank monitors persistent price pressures while the national economy shows signs of slowing export growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A seasonal park ranger in Colorado, Callum Heskett, has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies and misdemeanors after allegedly faking an attack on himself. Heskett claimed he was stabbed by an assailant, triggering a large-scale law enforcement response that included drones, a resident alert system, and lockdowns at several local schools. Investigators uncovered inconsistencies in his story, leading them to conclude the incident was a hoax. The staged event caused significant disruption and wasted public resources before the truth was revealed.</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, Chad Raines, has successfully transitioned from struggling with unprofitable crops to a thriving business in solar grazing. He rents out his flock of 6,000 sheep to act as natural lawnmowers for large-scale solar farms, keeping vegetation from obstructing the panels. This innovative approach provided him with a steady and significant income, turning a potential six-figure loss from traditional farming into a substantial profit. The trend highlights a symbiotic relationship between renewable energy infrastructure and agriculture, offering a lifeline to small farmers.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with cutting approximately $783 million in research grants from the National Institutes of Health. The funding cuts target projects related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which the administration has moved to eliminate across federal agencies. While the court lifted an injunction blocking the cuts, it kept in place a block on the administration's anti-DEI guidance for future funding. The ruling allows the cancellations to proceed while the underlying legal challenges continue in lower courts.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's encouragement, Missouri appears poised to become the next Republican-led state to redraw its congressional districts to favor the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterms. The move is part of a broader partisan battle over redistricting, initiated after Texas began redrawing its maps. The potential new Missouri map would likely target the district of Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver to create a 7-1 Republican majority in the state's House delegation.

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project in Arizona, which would be built on Oak Flat, a site sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe. After meeting with mining executives, Trump criticized a recent court decision that temporarily halted the transfer of the federal land to the mining companies. The project, which would create one of the world's largest copper mines, has been the subject of a long legal battle, pitting economic and resource demands against religious freedom and environmental concerns. The tribe has vowed to continue its fight to protect the sacred land.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Shift on Ukraine Security Guarantees Undermined by Russian Rejection</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the past week's foreign policy developments suggests President Trump has been made to look weak following his commitment to provide U.S. "security guarantees" to Ukraine. While European leaders saw the move as a significant policy shift, Russia has repeatedly stated that the presence of any foreign troops in Ukraine is unacceptable, effectively undermining the agreement. This public rejection from Russia casts doubt on the viability of the plan and the president's diplomatic strength. The article suggests the image Trump wants to project of dominance does not match the current reality.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 9-5 victory against the Colorado Rockies, earning a split in their four-game series.

The offense showed signs of life in the final two games at Coors Field, and starter Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance. The team now heads to San Diego for a pivotal three-game series against the second-place Padres, who have been gaining ground in the division race throughout August.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the massive financial penalty, which had grown to over $500 million with interest, imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial. While the court upheld the verdict that Trump is liable for fraud, it ruled that the monetary award was excessive and likely unconstitutional. The judges kept in place non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>A rainbow crosswalk in Orlando, part of a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, has been painted over by Florida's Department of Transportation. The removal was condemned by Orlando's mayor as a "cruel political act," while Governor Ron DeSantis stated on social media that state roads would not be "commandeered for political purposes." The action is consistent with a recent state policy prohibiting pavement art with social or political messages and follows warnings to other cities to remove similar crosswalks or risk losing transportation funding.</p>

          <p>Ahn Hak-sop, a 95-year-old former North Korean prisoner of war, made a symbolic journey to the border this week in an attempt to return to the North, where he wishes to be buried. Captured in 1953, he spent over 42 years in a South Korean prison for refusing to renounce his communist ideology and has lived near the border ever since. Despite changes in both countries, his belief in the North Korean cause and his anti-U.S. sentiment remain unwavering. South Korean authorities turned him away, stating they could not make the necessary arrangements for his crossing.</p>

The event served as a preview of the Republican messaging strategy for the upcoming midterm elections, particularly in the competitive Georgia Senate race, where Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff will be targeted for voting against the legislation.</p>

          <p>China is considering its first revision to its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb "involution," a term for destructive, cutthroat competition that has led to severe price wars in industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed amendment, drafted by top economic and market regulation bodies, aims to address practices such as selling products below cost to drive out competitors. Businesses, particularly in sectors suffering from overcapacity and homogenization, have expressed support for tighter regulations to create a more sustainable and less chaotic market environment.
