          <h2>Defense Secretary's Use of Unsecured Line Raises Security Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 18:43:41 EDT</div>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used the Signal app on a personal computer connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, also known as a 'dirty line,' within his Pentagon office. This practice raises concerns about potential monitoring and vulnerability to cyber threats, as commercial lines lack the firewall protections of the Defense Department's secure systems. While a DOD spokesperson stated that Hegseth has never used Signal on his government computer, the use of an unsecured line for communication raises questions about the security protocols followed by the Secretary of Defense, especially considering the sensitivity of information potentially being communicated. This incident has sparked debate regarding the balance between convenience and security in high-ranking government officials' communication practices.</p>

          <p>Three federal judges have temporarily blocked President Trump's efforts to withhold funds from schools implementing diversity and equity initiatives. The rulings prevent the administration from cutting off billions of dollars allocated for teachers, counselors, and academic programs in schools serving low-income students. One judge criticized the administration for lacking a detailed definition of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion,' and raised concerns that the policy could restrict free speech in the classroom and overstep executive authority over local schools. The potential loss of federal funding was described as crippling to many educational institutions.</p>

          <p>The rising popularity of Dubai chocolate, a sweet and salty treat featuring pistachio cream and kataifi, has led to a potential global pistachio shortage. Fueled by viral TikTok reviews, the demand for this Middle Eastern-inspired dessert has surged, with brands like Costco and Ghirardelli introducing their own versions. Industry experts report that pistachio prices have skyrocketed due to increased demand and a disappointing harvest last year, with California's pistachio supply falling significantly. This trend highlights the impact of social media on consumer behavior and the potential consequences for global supply chains.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation replaced the federal lawyers defending it in a lawsuit over New York City’s congestion pricing program, accusing them of undermining the department’s efforts to end the toll. This action was prompted by the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York mistakenly filing a confidential memo questioning the legal strategy to end the tolling plan. Transportation officials viewed the disclosure as a potential act of sabotage. The memo, dated April 11, warned that the transportation secretary's rationale for ending the tolling plan was weak and likely to fail.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have yielded less savings than initially promised, while incurring significant costs. Firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave for thousands of workers are estimated to cost upward of $135 billion this fiscal year. At the IRS, a DOGE-driven exodus of employees could cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 alone. These figures highlight the unintended financial consequences of drastic bureaucratic cuts and raise questions about the effectiveness of Musk's approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting the deep-sea mining industry to increase US production of critical minerals like nickel and copper. The order seeks to expedite mining permits in US waters and establish a process for issuing permits along the US Outer Continental Shelf. The administration believes extracting polymetallic nodules from the seabed could boost US GDP by $300 billion over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs. Environmental groups oppose deep-sea mining, citing potential irreversible biodiversity loss, while supporters argue it reduces the need for land-based mining operations.</p>

The administration has invoked the AEA, an 18th-century wartime authority, to deport alleged migrant gang members with limited due process, arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua constitutes a 'hybrid criminal state'.
