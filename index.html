          <h2>New York Fed Survey Indicates Inflation Fears Have Subsided to Pre-Tariff Levels</h2>

          <p>A recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that consumer inflation expectations have decreased, returning to levels seen before the implementation of recent trade tariffs. In June, respondents anticipated a 3% inflation rate over the next year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. While the overall inflation outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care, college tuition, and rent. The survey also noted improved employment metrics, with fewer people expecting job losses or a rise in unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively reinterprets the Johnson Amendment, a 70-year-old tax code provision that has historically barred such endorsements by non-profit organizations. The filing was part of a settlement motion in a lawsuit brought by religious groups arguing the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. A judge has yet to rule on the motion, which would permanently prevent the IRS from enforcing the provision against the plaintiff churches.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway after an "unknown actor" used artificial intelligence to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to a State Department cable. The imposter created a Signal account and contacted at least five high-level individuals, including three foreign ministers, a U.S. governor, and a member of Congress. The cable suggests the actor used AI-generated text and voice messages in an attempt to manipulate officials and gain access to sensitive information. The State Department has acknowledged the incident and stated it is taking steps to enhance its cybersecurity measures to prevent similar occurrences.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has introduced a new National Farm Security Action Plan aimed at preventing foreign adversaries, particularly China, from acquiring American farmland. The plan proposes legislative and executive actions to ban Chinese nationals from buying agricultural land and to assess foreign land holdings near military bases. Administration officials, including the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, framed the issue as a matter of national security, citing concerns about agroterrorism and the potential for agricultural resources to be "weaponized."

          <p>Recently signed legislation containing over $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts is expected to impact the pharmaceutical industry, though some companies are more exposed than others. According to an analysis by Leerink Partners, drugmakers like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences rely more heavily on Medicaid for their U.S. revenue compared to other large-cap pharma companies. For example, Medicaid accounts for about 25% of Vertex's U.S. sales, largely due to its expensive cystic fibrosis treatments. While the overall impact is seen as a "marginal negative," the cuts, set to begin in 2027, will present a future loss of revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

This anxiety has led to a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," as consumers look to build emergency funds amid uncertainty. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial decisions, instead recommending intentional strategies.

          <p>The team bus for the Wales women's national football team was involved in a traffic accident in Switzerland while on its way to a training session. The crash occurred near their team base ahead of a Euro 2025 match against France. According to the Football Association of Wales, all players and staff on the bus were uninjured, though the driver of the other vehicle involved was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. As a result of the incident, the team's scheduled training session at the stadium was canceled, but they were able to train later at their base.</p>

          <p>A sweeping new budget bill includes a provision for creating government-seeded investment accounts, nicknamed "Trump accounts," for children. Under the new law, U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028 will receive an initial $1,000 contribution from the government into an account that parents can open on their behalf. Parents and employers can contribute additional post-tax funds, which grow tax-deferred until the child turns 18, after which withdrawals are taxed as income. While financial experts note the "free money" is a benefit, they suggest other vehicles like 529 plans may offer better tax advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent memo from the Trump administration's Justice Department concluded there is no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein "client list" or grounds for investigating other third parties, effectively closing the case. This development has sparked outrage, particularly as Ghislaine Maxwell remains the only person imprisoned for what was a vast sex trafficking operation. The article argues that while conspiracy theories should be dismissed, it is not a conspiracy to point out that powerful people enabled Epstein's crimes and have an interest in covering up their associations. The fact that only one person has faced justice suggests a two-tier system.</p>

          <p>Melissa Turner was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2019 stabbing death of her partner, Matthew Trussler, with audio from a neighbor's security camera proving crucial for the prosecution. Turner claimed she acted in self-defense after Trussler strangled her during a physical altercation. However, the neighbor's camera captured audio of a woman's voice yelling phrases like "So f****** die" during the night of the incident. Combined with an in-home ADT camera showing Turner following an unarmed Trussler, prosecutors successfully argued against her self-defense claim, leading to a 20.5-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, has downplayed the likelihood of President Trump's tariffs causing significant price increases, comparing the odds to rare events like a meteor strike. Speaking on CNBC, Miran acknowledged that while such events can happen, there is currently no evidence of widespread tariff-driven inflation. He promoted a new White House report showing a fall in imported goods prices between December and May. Economists, however, argue that price hikes are still expected, citing delays in tariff implementation and the time it takes for costs to filter to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aggressive immigration sweeps by the Trump administration in Southern California have resulted in a growing problem of abandoned property, as arrested individuals are forced to leave cars, work tools, and vending carts behind. In response, the Santa Ana Police Department has launched an initiative to help return these belongings to the families of those detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The effort is also intended to build trust with the community, as local police emphasize they are not collaborating with federal immigration agents. Advocacy groups are also working to reunite families with their essential property.</p>

          <p>The killing of Bruno, a 7-year-old police bloodhound credited with finding nine people during his career, has caused outrage across Italy and prompted a criminal investigation. Bruno was found dead in his shed in southern Taranto after being fed dog food embedded with nails. His trainer suspects he was the ultimate target due to his work rescuing dogs from illegal dogfighting rings, for which he had received threats. The killing has been condemned by public figures, including Premier Giorgia Meloni, and has led to a criminal complaint being filed under a new, stricter animal cruelty law.</p>
