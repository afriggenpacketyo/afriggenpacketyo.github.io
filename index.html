          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce stricter rules for migrants seeking asylum in the UK who wish to bring their families over. The new criteria will include tougher English language standards and proof of sufficient funds. These changes aim to align the UK's policies with those of other European countries, with Cooper highlighting the need to overhaul a "broken" asylum system to end the use of hotels for migrants. The government also plans to deport some migrants arriving on small boats to France under a pilot scheme, while the opposition criticizes the government's handling of the borders. The government aims to stop using hotels for asylum seekers by the end of this Parliament.</p>

          <p>The Guatemalan government stated that it suggested to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, led by Secretary Kristi Noem, the return of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors to their home country. The Guatemalan government's goal is to prevent the children from staying in shelters and detention centers, and they intend to include the children in social programs. Attorneys representing the children disagree, arguing that sending them away without allowing them to pursue asylum claims violates federal laws and the U.S. constitution. A U.S. district court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the government from removing any unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in U.S. custody for 14 days.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with broken bones and other injuries after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. According to state police, a Honda driven by a 19-year-old woman hit the back of a Ford that Giuliani was riding in. Before the crash, Giuliani had reportedly assisted a woman who was a victim of domestic violence, contacting 911 and remaining on the scene until officers arrived. Giuliani's son, Andrew, thanked people for their support after the crash, while authorities confirmed that the incident was not a targeted attack.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is expanding its military footprint on the contested Spratly Islands, which China claims as the Nansha Islands, according to recent satellite images. All 21 Vietnamese-occupied features have been expanded to include artificial land, with infrastructure such as munitions storage taking shape. This expansion signals Vietnam's resolve to solidify its claims in the region, potentially spurring Beijing to upgrade its own defense posture. Other claimants over the archipelago include Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei, creating a complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a downturn as investors assessed a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of former President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs illegal." The court ruled that Trump exceeded his presidential authority by imposing levies on virtually every country as part of his April 2 announcement. Investors are also monitoring developments in India-China relations, with leaders from both countries emphasizing their partnership. Chinese shares are under scrutiny, particularly Alibaba Group, following a surge in stock value after better-than-expected earnings results.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a deportation order. The ruling came as planes were prepared to take off from Texas, carrying migrant children. Lawyers argued that the deportation effort would circumvent legal protections for these minors, who could face abuse, neglect, or persecution if returned to Guatemala. The Justice Department argued that the children were being repatriated to reunite with relatives, but lawyers for the children disputed these claims, citing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) is identified as the largest and most active spy agency globally, targeting both foreign powers and Chinese nationals abroad. The MSS uses various methods, including monitoring social media and infiltrating college campuses, to gather information and suppress dissent. The US Department of Justice has indicted over 140 people for felonies related to spying for China within the U.S., including a former aide to the governor of New York. The Chinese government coerces Chinese nationals abroad by threatening to harm their family members back home in China.</p>

          <p>Two high school seniors, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, made a groundbreaking discovery by creating a new trigonometry-based proof of the Pythagorean Theorem, a problem that stumped mathematicians for centuries. The students, from St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, independently developed their proofs as part of a school math contest. Their work has garnered international attention and challenged the long-held belief that a trigonometric proof of the theorem was impossible. The students have since submitted further proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem and are being celebrated for their mathematical achievement.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) is identified as the world's largest and most active spy agency, targeting not only foreign powers but also Chinese nationals living abroad. To do so, the agency recruits spies in the U.S. to be its eyes abroad. According to Jim Lewis, the MSS spies on Chinese nationals living abroad in a few ways, including surveillance of WeChat and infiltration of college campuses. The MSS uses many of the same techniques as other spy agencies: sex, money, and revenge.</p>
