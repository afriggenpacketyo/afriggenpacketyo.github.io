          <h2>Politeness Comes at a Price When Interacting with AI Chatbots</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 17:55:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that saying "please" and "thank you" to chatbots costs the company tens of millions of dollars in electricity. While it may seem trivial to be polite to an artificial intelligence, the extra words increase the cost for servers processing the requests. Every interaction with a chatbot requires energy and money, making each additional word a factor in operational costs. Altman humorously acknowledged the expense as "well spent," suggesting the company values user experience despite the financial implications.</p>

This move threatens the financial infrastructure of the Democratic Party, potentially hindering their ability to compete in elections and pleasing elements of Trump's base.

          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to take steps toward mining the ocean floor, despite international treaties and widespread opposition to such activity. The executive order seeks to circumvent a decades-old treaty ratified by most major coastal nations, positioning the U.S. as a leader in seabed mineral exploration.

          <p>The National Security Council (NSC) under President Trump is described as chaotic and unstable, marked by firings, disregard for protocol, and the influence of online personalities. Experts have been purged, security protocols ignored, and decisions made without traditional NSC processes. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, influenced dismissals, and Jack Posobiec, a right-wing commentator, provided input on hiring. The dysfunction stems from Trump's impatience, disregard for the law, and preference for loyalty over expertise, marginalizing the NSC in foreign policy decision-making.</p>

The court was not informed beforehand that the State Bar had allowed its psychometrician to use AI to develop a subset of questions.

Tactics include firing civil servants, repealing Temporary Protected Status, and focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The agenda aims to reshape American society by ending policies that acknowledge climate change and promoting traditional families with male breadwinners and female caregivers.</p>
