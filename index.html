        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has lowered its global economic growth forecast for the year, citing the impact of President Donald Trump's US tariffs. Worldwide growth is now projected to slow to 2.9%, a decrease from the previous forecast of 3.1%. The OECD attributed the downgrade to a significant rise in trade barriers, warning that the weakened economic outlook will have widespread effects across the globe. Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing these measures has created substantial uncertainty in international markets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search in Portugal for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared nearly two decades ago. The search, focused on 21 plots of land near Praia da Luz, aims to gather evidence related to the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, currently imprisoned in Germany for a separate sexual assault case. BrÃ¼ckner, who denies involvement in McCann's disappearance, has been identified as a formal suspect by Portuguese authorities, and any evidence found will be handed over to German investigators. The current search is expected to continue until Friday, with German police taking the lead and focusing on a ruined building near the resort where Madeleine was last seen. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has revealed that the sector is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. Led by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Water Commission's interim findings highlight issues such as pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures, shaking public trust. The review emphasizes the need for clearer government direction, improved long-term investment strategies, and a stronger voice for local communities, while also considering options for streamlining and aligning regulators. The government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, and the final report is expected later this summer, with the government set to respond in full to the commission's recommendations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from FWD.us estimates that families across the U.S. spend nearly $350 billion annually supporting incarcerated loved ones, a figure four times higher than the federal government's operational costs for prisons and jails. The study, conducted in partnership with Duke University and NORC, highlights the financial burdens families face, including expenses for phone calls, visits, and commissary purchases, as well as lost income both during and after incarceration. Researchers emphasize that these costs disproportionately affect lower-income families, exacerbating financial instability. The report underscores the need for comprehensive data on the impact of incarceration on families, especially as incarceration rates are rising amid growing concerns about basic necessities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of electric vehicle (EV) tax credits in the U.S. is uncertain as negotiations on a Republican megabill could significantly alter incentives for EV purchases. The House-passed version of the bill includes cuts to consumer tax credits for new EVs, phasing them out after 2026, and eliminating the tax credit for used EVs at the end of 2025. Additionally, the bill introduces a $250 annual fee for EV drivers and tightens restrictions on battery manufacturing tax credits related to Chinese-made components. Automakers and advocacy groups are concerned that these changes could slow EV adoption and put manufacturing investments at risk, though some Republicans argue that markets should determine vehicle choices without government incentives.

United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, is prioritizing the addition of striking power to enhance the team's attacking capabilities following a season with limited goal-scoring success. While Matheus Cunha has already agreed to join United, the club is confident in pursuing Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals for Brentford last season, after receiving indications that Manchester United is his preferred destination. Mbeumo is seen as a versatile and dynamic player, although not a natural number nine, and Amorim seeks flexible players to bolster the squad.</p>

          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London have faced significant disruptions due to a fallen tree causing damage to overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, affecting services until 14:00. Some trains scheduled to depart from Glasgow are now starting in Preston, Lancashire, resulting in delays of several hours, with ticket holders advised to use alternative services or seek refunds. Network Rail Scotland is working to repair the damaged lines, aiming to reopen the line by 11:30.</p>

          <p>Dame Tipping Primary School in east London has instructed pupils to stay indoors due to a dive-bombing buzzard nesting in the playground. Concerns arose after reports of the bird swooping on residents, leading Havering Council to provide advice, including deterrents and potentially hiring a falconry expert. The buzzard, nicknamed Brenda by the pupils, is believed to be protecting its nest or chicks, and because buzzards are a protected species, intervention options are limited. The school is using this as a learning opportunity, incorporating the buzzard into art, stories, and other projects, while a bird of prey expert visited the school to educate children about birds of prey.</p>

          <p>German peace researchers are urging Europe and Germany to prepare for a future without NATO, citing the political changes in the U.S. and the influence of President Donald Trump. According to their 2025 Peace Report, the transatlantic partnership between the U.S. and Europe has come to an end, with Trump's administration undermining liberal institutions and courting authoritarian rulers. The researchers recommend that the German government pursue a transparent plan for expanding and integrating European defense structures, emphasizing the need for arms control, diplomacy, and effective development policies. The report also calls for a halt to arms deliveries to Israel and criticizes the invitation of Benjamin Netanyahu to Germany.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman on trial for the murder of three relatives, testified that she has long enjoyed mushrooms and developed a preference for wild fungi due to their enhanced flavor. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder after serving a meal containing death cap mushrooms to her relatives in July 2023. Prosecutors allege she deliberately included the poisonous mushrooms, while her defense claims it was a tragic accident. Patterson described foraging for wild mushrooms during the Covid pandemic, and stated that she tried cooking a small part of a wild mushroom in butter before serving it to her guests.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts that U.S. economic growth will decelerate to 1.6% this year, down from 2.8% last year, primarily due to President Donald Trump's trade policies. The OECD also projects a further slowdown to 1.5% in 2026, attributing the decline to disrupted global commerce, increased costs, and uncertainty for businesses and consumers. Trump's policies have significantly raised average U.S. tariff rates, leading to higher costs for consumers and manufacturers relying on imported materials. The OECD anticipates that world economic growth will also slow to 2.9% in both 2025 and 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are struggling with the environmental impact of huge visitor numbers, with tourism booming worldwide and many destinations becoming overcrowded. Overtourism, defined as the point at which tourism negatively impacts the quality of life in a region, exacerbates existing problems, stretches infrastructure, and disrupts local ecosystems. Contributing factors include air travel, cruise ships, and the popularity of film locations, while potential solutions involve limiting traveler numbers, implementing higher taxes, managing visitor flows through digital booking systems, and promoting attractions outside city centers. Copenhagen is trying a different approach by instead rewarding more climate-friendly travelers, with those arriving by train able to access free rental bikes, yoga lessons, guided tours and reduced admission prices.</p>
