          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. Lord Justice Bean described the initial injunction, obtained by the local council, as "seriously flawed in principle," noting it failed to consider the challenges of relocating the migrants. The decision comes amidst ongoing protests and political debate surrounding the use of hotels for asylum accommodation, with a full High Court hearing on a permanent injunction expected in October. The ruling highlights the legal and social complexities of the UK's asylum policies.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, just months after emerging from a previous restructuring in March. The budget carrier, struggling with high costs and weaker domestic demand, now plans to reduce its network and fleet to cut costs by hundreds of millions annually. The airline sought to reassure customers that operations will continue as normal during the process. This second filing indicates that its initial restructuring, which focused on debt-for-equity swaps, was insufficient to address its fundamental financial challenges.</p>

          <p>A significant tax loophole known as the de minimis exemption, which allowed imported parcels valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been eliminated. Experts predict this will lead to higher prices for consumers on goods ordered from overseas, such as clothing and electronics, as tariffs are now applied to all shipments. The White House stated the change was necessary to close a pathway for illicit goods and level the playing field for American businesses. Consumers may also experience longer delivery times due to increased customs inspections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Adarius Hayes, a linebacker for the University of Miami football team, has surrendered to police on multiple charges, including three counts of vehicular homicide. The charges stem from a May crash in Florida that resulted in the deaths of a 78-year-old woman and two children, aged 10 and 4. Investigators determined Hayes was driving recklessly at nearly 80 mph in a 40 mph zone just before the collision. The university has indefinitely suspended Hayes from all team activities following the charges.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The protest aims to draw attention to a $213 million budget deficit facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which has led to significant service cuts. Kenyatta blames Republican inaction in the state legislature for the funding crisis, which impacts students, seniors, and workers who rely on public transit. The march is intended to highlight the issue and pressure lawmakers to pass one of several bipartisan funding proposals.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton's run at the US Open has ended after he was forced to retire from his third-round match against Adrian Mannarino due to a shoulder injury.

After losing the set and consulting with a trainer, he conceded the match, allowing Mannarino to advance to the last 16 at the tournament for the first time.

          <p>The Trump administration has continued to forge closer ties with the cryptocurrency industry, exemplified by a recent complex partnership between Truth Social and Crypto.com to hold large amounts of the Cronos token. This move follows a series of pro-crypto actions, including deregulation and the president's personal gains from a memecoin, which have positioned the U.S. as a "crypto capital." Critics argue these actions represent a significant conflict of interest, serving to both reward a supportive industry and inflate the president's personal net worth. The administration's embrace of crypto marks a stark departure from the industry's anti-establishment origins.</p>

The act was a protest against a new executive order signed by President Trump directing the Justice Department to investigate flag burning. The charges are not for the act of burning the flag itself, which is protected as symbolic speech by a 1989 Supreme Court ruling, but for lighting a fire in a non-designated area. The executive order attempts to circumvent the court's precedent by focusing on violations of other "content-neutral laws."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its investigation into three prominent Democratic figures—Senator Adam Schiff, NY Attorney General Letitia James, and Fed Governor Lisa Cook—for alleged mortgage fraud. Critics, including The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, have labeled the move "an ominous turn in political lawfare," suggesting it is a targeted use of federal power against the president's political enemies. While misstating information on a mortgage application is a felony, it is rarely prosecuted. This selective enforcement is seen as a corrosive tactic that could set a dangerous precedent for future political revenge.</p>

After examining online materials believed to belong to the shooter, Robin Westman, they suggest the attack aligns with a trend of misanthropic violence rather than a specific political cause. The materials show a chaotic mix of left-wing and right-wing extremist references, alongside a deep reverence for past mass killers. This suggests the primary motive may have been a desire for notoriety within violent online subcultures, rather than a clear ideological message.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock jumped nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter. The strong performance was largely driven by its cloud computing unit, which saw revenue grow 26% year-over-year, an acceleration from the previous quarter. The company stated that robust demand for artificial intelligence services was a key factor, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the growth in the high-margin cloud business and signs of revival in e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An administrative law judge has ruled that a Pacific Palisades homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can investigate State Farm's claims handling practices as part of the insurer's rate-increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a 17% emergency increase granted in May. The ruling combines the issues, ensuring that the company's service to customers is considered alongside its request for higher rates.</p>

He spent the latter half of last season on loan at Betis, where he rediscovered his form.

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Marvell Technology plummeted 18% after the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report revealed weaker-than-expected data center revenue and a lackluster forecast.

Furthermore, the company projected flat sequential growth for the data center business in the third quarter, raising concerns among investors about its near-term AI growth prospects.

          <p>KUSC-FM, a prominent classical music station in Los Angeles, has laid off several employees due to significant cuts in federal funding for public broadcasting. The station's operator, Classical California, confirmed it experienced a $1.1 million reduction in support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after the Republican-led Congress clawed back allocated funds. The cuts affect non-announcer positions and highlight the financial strain faced by public media outlets, particularly those focused on arts and culture, that rely on federal support. The station is now appealing directly to listeners for contributions to help cover the shortfall.</p>

          <p>Montreal-based luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for bankruptcy protection, citing a sudden liquidity crisis. The company's CEO pointed to increased trade pressures, including the recent elimination of the "de minimis" exemption for low-value parcels shipped to the United States. This rule change, which ended duty-free shipping for packages under $800, has significantly impacted e-commerce firms that rely on the U.S. market. The company plans to restructure while continuing to operate and pay employees, but the filing highlights the significant real-world consequences of the new U.S. tariff policies.</p>
