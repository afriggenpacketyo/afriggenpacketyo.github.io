          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector experienced a significant downturn following the introduction of a new draft of a major U.S. spending bill. The proposed legislation includes a tax on solar and wind projects that use components manufactured in China and accelerates the phase-out of crucial tax credits, creating major uncertainty for developers. While the bill poses significant risks to large-scale renewable projects by compressing timelines, some analysts note that the rooftop solar industry may see relative benefits from the proposed changes.

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind a planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies, a move aimed at restarting trade talks with the United States. The decision came just hours before the first payments were due and followed a threat from President Trump to halt all trade negotiations over the tax, which he called a "blatant attack." The tax would have applied a 3% charge on Canadian revenues for tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta. White House officials have confirmed that negotiations will resume following Canada's reversal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed significant failings and wide disparities in how police forces across England and Wales handle cases of coercive or controlling behavior, ten years after it was criminalized. Survivors report having to act as their own detectives, gathering extensive evidence of psychological and physical abuse, only to be met with poor police responses. The report highlights that some forces log coercive control crimes at a rate three times higher than others, indicating a lack of consistent understanding and prioritization. Leading figures warn that these systemic failures are putting lives at risk and demand urgent reform.</p>

Rising expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, fueled by presidential pressure on the Federal Reserve, have also contributed to the currency's weakness, pushing it to its lowest level since March 2022.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could further dismantle campaign finance regulations by challenging the limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates. The challenge, brought by Republican committees and politicians including Vice-President JD Vance, argues that these spending limits infringe upon their First Amendment free speech rights. This case follows the court's landmark 2010 Citizens United ruling, which removed limits on outside spending. A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could significantly increase the flow of coordinated money in U.S. elections.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced that a key satellite program used for weather forecasting will be discontinued by July 31, right as the U.S. enters the peak of hurricane season.

The decision to halt the data processing, attributed to mitigating a significant cybersecurity risk, raises concerns about forecasting capabilities, especially as NOAA has recently faced staff reductions.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the decision between opening a certificate of deposit (CD) or investing in the stock market depends heavily on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. CDs are recommended for short-term goals as they offer a guaranteed, albeit lower, rate of return and protect the principal investment. In contrast, stocks offer higher potential long-term growth but come with significantly more risk and volatility, making them better suited for goals that are many years or decades away. Ultimately, experts note that it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision, as a balanced approach can serve different financial purposes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analytical article in The Atlantic argues that progressive legal advocates are making strategic errors by bringing high-risk cases to a Supreme Court with a solid conservative majority. The author contends that this approach has led to predictable, major losses on issues like transgender rights and religious exemptions, effectively allowing a hostile court to codify a conservative agenda. Instead of relying on federal courts, the article suggests that progressives should recalibrate their strategy to focus on building popular support and shaping constitutional culture through democratic and political arenas. This approach would avoid handing victories to a court that is ideologically opposed to their goals.</p>

The new government has argued that sanctions have crippled its ability to pay salaries and rebuild its health care system.

The article specifically critiques Allie Beth Stuckey's book "Toxic Empathy," arguing that it reframes Christian compassion as a political vulnerability to be overcome.

The increases come as the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009. In Washington, D.C., the wage will rise to $17.95 an hour, while Alaska's will increase to $13.00. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these raises will provide a crucial income boost, particularly for women and minority workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has thrown out appellate court rulings from four states that had favored transgender people, ordering the lower courts to reexamine the cases. This action follows the high court's recent decision that upheld a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatments for transgender youth. The reversed rulings, from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, had found state restrictions on medical care and birth certificate changes to be unconstitutional. The move represents a significant setback for transgender rights advocates, directing lower courts to reconsider their decisions in light of the new precedent.</p>
