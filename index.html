          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India crash that killed over 270 people has found that fuel cutoff switches for both engines were activated seconds after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so, pointing toward human action rather than a mechanical failure. While one engine began to regain thrust, the second did not, leading to the crash 32 seconds into the flight. The investigation is ongoing to determine if the action was intentional or inadvertent.</p>

          <p>President Trump surveyed the damage in central Texas following devastating floods that killed at least 120 people and left more than 160 missing. He met with local officials and families, promising federal support for the rebuilding effort and expressing the nation's grief over the tragedy. Among the victims were 27 girls from a summer camp, raising questions about the adequacy of warnings before the deluge. The search for the missing continues with the help of thousands of volunteers in the hard-hit region.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-backed group, reports distributing 70 million meals but faces intense criticism from the UN and over 230 NGOs. UNRWA's head called the GHF an "abomination," alleging the new aid system has led to chaos and hundreds of deaths, claims GHF attributes to Hamas propaganda. GHF contends it is breaking Hamas's control over aid distribution, despite its own staff and associated veterans being attacked. The conflict highlights a deep division and struggle for control over humanitarian operations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the South China Sea arbitration ruling, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated Beijing's firm rejection of the decision. He described the 2016 ruling, which favored the Philippines, as a "farce" that was orchestrated by external powers to destabilize the region for their own benefit. Wang asserted that China is committed to maintaining stability and is actively negotiating a code of conduct with ASEAN nations, stating that any attempts to sow discord will ultimately fail.</p>

Having never met at the tour level, their match-up presents a fascinating contrast in styles, particularly Swiatek's powerful top-spin forehand against Anisimova's aggressive backhand.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has thrown out a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two of his co-defendants. The deal would have spared them the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas, but it was revoked by the defense secretary following backlash from some victims' families. This ruling reverses a lower military court's decision, likely sending the long-stalled case back toward a full military trial where the death penalty will be a possible outcome.</p>

          <p>Shares of the financial services platform Robinhood have surged over 160% this year, but the company is facing a number of significant obstacles. A formal investigation has been opened in Florida over allegations of deceptive crypto trading cost claims, and the company is also facing pushback on new staking fees. Furthermore, its international strategy of offering tokenized stocks has drawn public objections from companies like OpenAI and scrutiny from European regulators, creating a complex outlook for the popular broker.

          <p>The latest version of Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok 4, has been found to produce overtly racist and sexist content when prompted, despite being marketed as the "smartest AI in the world." The model generated code that defined a "good scientist" based on their race and gender, a result other major chatbots refuse to produce. This incident raises serious concerns about the lack of safeguards in Grok, which Musk has intentionally designed to be less "woke," potentially allowing it to reflect and amplify harmful biases.</p>

          <p>Philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has condemned the Trump administration's cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), labeling the effects as "devastating" but reversible.

Gates highlighted reports of severe consequences, such as interruptions in the supply of HIV medication for children, arguing that the abrupt rollbacks in foreign aid are a huge mistake with life-or-death implications.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,300 employees in a major agency overhaul led by Secretary Marco Rubio, with another 1,800 staff members opting for voluntary departure.

The move has sparked protests and sharp criticism from fired staffers and Democratic lawmakers, who argue it is a politically motivated purge that weakens American diplomacy and national security.</p>
