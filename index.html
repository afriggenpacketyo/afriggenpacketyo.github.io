            <h2>China's Chip Traders Lament Tariff Impact as Orders Plummet</h2>

            <p>Chinese semiconductor traders are experiencing a sharp decline in orders due to escalating tariffs imposed by the US. Chip distributors in Shenzhen report a significant drop in orders and a 10-40% price increase for CPUs from Intel and AMD. The tariffs, which now total 156% on some US imports, are directly impacting domestic buyers who rely on US-sourced chips. This situation highlights the immediate consequences of the US-China trade war on the semiconductor supply chain, as businesses grapple with increased costs and reduced demand.

            <p>Mexico is again grappling with the debate over whether to ban narcocorridos, songs that glorify drug trafficking, in an attempt to reduce violence. President Claudia Sheinbaum opposes such bans, advocating for social awareness to discourage glorification of drug trafficking. However, voices within her own party support bans, despite criticism from lawyers and doubts about their effectiveness. The debate has resurfaced after a concert in Texcoco ended in a brawl when the artist refused to sing narcocorridos due to local regulations.</p>

            <p>CATL, China's leading EV battery manufacturer, is partnering with Sinopec and Nio to establish a nationwide battery-swapping network. The initiative aims to alleviate range anxiety by allowing EV owners to quickly exchange depleted batteries for fully charged ones. CATL plans to build 30,000 swapping stations, including the first ones in Hong Kong and Macau. This collaboration is expected to encourage more EV makers and drivers to adopt battery-swapping technology for its speed and efficiency.</p>

            <p>Formula 1 is debating the future of its engines, with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem initially pushing for a return to V10 naturally aspirated engines. However, engine manufacturers opposed the idea, leading to discussions about a simplified hybrid engine format. The new engine will definitely be a hybrid, but its size, cylinder count, and turbocharging remain uncertain. The debate also involves the importance of engine noise, with some fans romanticizing the loud engines of the past, while others prefer a more modern and quieter sound.</p>
