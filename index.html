          <p>A CBS News crew gained access to Tehran following a ceasefire in the Israel-Iran conflict, observing a city slowly recovering from Israeli strikes. The crew's 14-hour journey from the Turkish border was marked by checkpoints and poor road conditions, highlighting the challenges of access. Despite the ceasefire, Iranian airspace was partially closed, necessitating the long drive. While some residents have fled, others are venturing out, with cafes and restaurants reopening in places like Firdous Park, but life remains far from normal as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remains out of sight, leaving many Iranians uncertain about the future. The article reveals that while Iranians may have diverse opinions about the regime, they share a united sentiment regarding their country. </p>

The incident occurred near Santa Monica Place, prompting a large police response and a manhunt for the suspect. Following a tip, the suspect was apprehended approximately three hours later, and the handgun believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered.

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks selected Cooper Flagg, an 18-year-old sensation from Duke, as the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft, marking a new era for the team. Flagg, a consensus college player of the year, will join a roster already featuring Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. This pick follows the Mavericks' controversial trade of Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers, a move that initially sparked fan protests and pessimism. However, winning the NBA Draft Lottery with a slim chance allowed the Mavericks to secure Flagg, offering hope for the team's future and a chance to turn the page on the Doncic era.</p>

He emphasized that protecting teammates is a natural reaction when tensions rise, and such incidents can galvanize a team. Hoffman also highlighted the importance of pitching inside but doing so responsibly to avoid escalating conflicts, as the two teams are set to face off again in August.</p>

          <p>Emily Eavis, organizer of Glastonbury Festival, describes the unique atmosphere of the festival's first two days, particularly the "Thursday feeling" when the site reaches capacity. She likens the opening of the gates to "letting people into Christmas," emphasizing the excitement and anticipation as attendees reunite with friends and immerse themselves in the festival experience. Eavis recalls her childhood memories of the festival, noting that the "look in their eyes" of attendees has remained consistent over the years: a mix of cheer, determination, excitement, and a sense of magic. The festival's opening is a moment of release and community, distinct from the main stage performances later in the week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has determined that California violated Title IX by allowing transgender girls to compete on girls' sports teams. The administration proposed a resolution requiring California to bar transgender women from women's sports and strip transgender athletes of records, titles, and awards, threatening to terminate the state's federal education funding if the proposal is rejected. This action is a reversal from the Joe Biden administration's efforts to expand Title IX protections for transgender students. The proposed resolution would also require schools to adopt biology-based definitions of "male" and "female" and send apology letters to athletes who lost to transgender competitors.</p>

While proponents see potential for therapies to improve aging and create disease-resistant cells, critics fear the project could lead to designer babies or unforeseen genetic modifications. The project, known as the Synthetic Human Genome Project, marks a significant leap forward from the Human Genome Project, enabling scientists to create DNA rather than just read it.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. The order, signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, prevents the administration from deporting immigrants who file paperwork with the Maryland district court seeking a review of their detention. The administration argues that the order violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president's authority to enforce immigration laws. This action is an escalation of the conflict between the administration and the federal judiciary over immigration policies, highlighting the administration's frustration with judges who have blocked executive branch actions.</p>

The alternative cover features Carpenter in an elegant gown leaning against a man in a suit, reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe, offering a more traditional and sophisticated image. Carpenter has faced controversy before, including backlash from the Catholic Church for filming a music video at a church, but maintains that her brand is not solely based on sex.</p>

          <p>California drivers should brace for higher gas prices in July due to a state sales tax increase and stricter regulations on refineries aimed at promoting lower-carbon fuels. These combined increases could raise gas prices by nearly 70 cents per gallon, adding to the financial burden of summer road trips. While oil supply currently outweighs demand, leading to slightly cheaper prices compared to 2024, the state's policies will counteract this trend. The state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard program, designed to incentivize lower-carbon fuels, will impose stricter limits on carbon intensity, further increasing costs for motorists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Americans are bracing for potential welfare cuts as Congress considers President Trump's budget bill, which includes reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The proposed cuts have sparked concern among low-income households, particularly in states like West Virginia, where a significant portion of the population relies on food subsidies. While Trump has claimed that the cuts will help lower food prices, critics argue that they will exacerbate the struggles of impoverished families. The debate over funding social welfare programs highlights divisions within the Republican Party, with some prioritizing budget balancing and others supporting programs that directly aid their constituents.</p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders analyzes Zohran Mamdaniâ€™s victory in a New York City primary, suggesting it offers a lesson for the Democratic Party. Sanders argues that Mamdani's success stems from addressing real economic and moral issues, taking on corporate power, and advocating for policies that benefit working families. He criticizes the Democratic establishment for relying on wealthy donors and ignoring the struggles of ordinary Americans. Sanders highlights Mamdani's progressive policy proposals, such as taxing the wealthy, rent control, free public transportation, and publicly owned grocery stores, as evidence of a winning strategy that prioritizes the needs of working people.</p>

The EU's preliminary assessment indicates that the deal could increase Mars' bargaining power against EU retailers, leading to higher prices. EU competition chief Teresa Ribera emphasized the importance of ensuring that the acquisition does not further drive up the cost of shopping baskets, especially amid inflation and high food prices. Mars defended the acquisition, saying it would deliver more choice and innovation to consumers, but the EU's investigation will assess the deal's impact on product prices.</p>

The president of the Tibetan government-in-exile suggests that selection after the Dalai Lama's death through reincarnation remains the most likely scenario. The Dalai Lama is expected to make an announcement at a meeting of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, but the content remains unknown, as China's policy on Tibet is viewed as an attempt to eliminate Tibetan identity.</p>

One ticket pulling company boss claimed his team bought hundreds of tickets for Swift's Eras tour and that some touts are making millions through this practice.

The author highlights how Iran's adherence to regime-sanctioned fantasies made it impossible for officials to grasp Israel's actual abilities, leading to wartime defeats. The author draws parallels to the U.S., citing appointments like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary and Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence, suggesting a similar trend of prioritizing allegiance over proficiency. The article warns that when allegiance replaces proficiency, and conspiracism replaces competency, disaster looms, emphasizing the importance of competence and expertise in leadership.</p>
