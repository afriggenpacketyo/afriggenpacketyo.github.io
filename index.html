          <p>The Trump administration has returned a Guatemalan man to the United States after a judge ruled he was wrongly deported without due process. The man, identified as O.C.G. in court documents, had sought asylum in the U.S. following violent attacks in Guatemala. After being deported and then returning, an immigration judge initially barred his deportation, but O.C.G. was subsequently sent to Mexico without due process, where he was allegedly held for ransom and sexually assaulted. The Justice Department admitted errors in their initial account of his removal, leading to the judge mandating his return to the U.S., where he will now seek protection from persecution.</p>

          <p>President Trump is working to consolidate support among Senate Republicans for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a legislative package advancing his agenda. Senate Republicans are holding meetings to discuss the bill, with Trump engaging members of the Senate Finance Committee at the White House. The bill includes extensions of the 2017 Trump tax cuts and increased spending on military and border security, but also entails cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. While some Republicans express concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit, Senate leadership aims to pass the bill by Trump's Fourth of July deadline, navigating internal divisions and external criticism from figures like Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is suing Texas to block a state law that provides in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants, arguing it violates federal law. The DOJ contends that the Texas law conflicts with federal statutes prohibiting higher education institutions from offering benefits to undocumented individuals that are not available to U.S. citizens. This legal action is a response to executive orders signed by President Trump aimed at preventing taxpayer-funded benefits for unqualified aliens and protecting American communities from criminal aliens. The Texas law, known as the Texas Dream Act, was introduced in 2001 to allow students graduating from Texas high schools to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status.</p>

          <p>A proposed restructuring plan for Voice of America (VOA) could result in the firing of nearly all of its remaining employees. The plan would leave only 18 employees at the federally funded news agency, which was established in 1942 to combat Nazi propaganda. This significant reduction in staff raises concerns about the future of the news agency and its ability to fulfill its mission.

          <p>A researcher is disputing claims that a fungus labeled a "potential agroterrorism weapon" in a recent arrest is a significant threat, arguing that it is already widespread in the U.S. Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were charged with attempting to smuggle strains of Fusarium graminearum into the United States for research purposes. Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, states that F. graminearum is prevalent across the U.S. and causes a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight. Farmers use various methods to mitigate the risk of the fungus, and the FDA monitors toxins produced by it.</p>

          <p>Zoe Saldaña revealed that she "collapsed" physically and lost her voice after winning an Oscar for her role in “Emilia Pérez.” She explained that her body had been running on adrenaline for months during awards season, and once it was over, her immune system crashed. Despite the film's success, it faced criticism for its portrayal of transgender issues and Mexico. Saldaña defended the film, stating that it was about friendship and universal struggles, not just Mexico.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%. The move is intended to secure the future of the American steel industry, but critics say it could harm steel producers outside the US and spark retaliation from trade partners. The UK was granted a carve-out, leaving duties on its steel and aluminium at 25%. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in other sectors and increase prices for consumers.</p>
