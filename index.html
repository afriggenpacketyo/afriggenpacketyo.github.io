          <p>Police in Los Angeles discovered two deceased individuals with gunshot wounds to the head during a welfare check at a residence in the Encino neighborhood. The incident is being actively investigated as a double homicide, with authorities noting a broken sliding glass door at the scene. No arrests have been made, and the identities of the victims have not yet been released to the public pending notification of their next of kin. The investigation remains ongoing as police continue to search for suspects and establish a motive in the case.</p>

          <p>European Union officials have cautiously welcomed the Trump administration's recent policy reversal on Ukraine, which includes approving new arms sales and threatening increased pressure on Russia. However, key European leaders have expressed concerns, emphasizing that the US should also share the financial burden of arming Ukraine. The new American plan, which would see European nations purchase US weapons to send to Kyiv, has raised questions about whether it constitutes genuine American aid or primarily a business opportunity for the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that was set to remove unpaid medical debt from consumers' credit reports. The ruling states the CFPB overstepped its authority, a decision that affects approximately 15 million Americans who carry about $49 billion in medical debt on their records. Consumer advocates argue the now-vacated rule was crucial for protecting individuals from the negative credit impacts of often complex and disputed medical billing issues. This decision reverses a significant consumer protection measure that had not yet gone into effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China are engaged in an intensifying intelligence conflict, highlighted by the recent FBI arrest of a suspected Chinese hacker accused of stealing COVID-19 vaccine research. In a reciprocal move, China's Ministry of State Security announced it had thwarted three foreign espionage plots, warning of aggressive infiltration efforts by foreign powers. This escalation reflects the broader and deepening technological and geopolitical competition between the two global powers under the current US administration, signaling a period of heightened mistrust and strategic maneuvering.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation increased in June, with the annual rate rising to 2.7%, its highest level since February. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.3%, driven by increases in energy, food, and other categories like apparel and medical care. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.9% over the past year. Economists suggest the data shows early signs of the impact of tariffs, though the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting.

          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was intensely questioned by senators during his confirmation hearing regarding a recent security scandal. Democrats pressed Waltz on his decision to add a journalist to a private Signal group chat discussing military strikes, an incident that led to his ousting as National Security Advisor. While Waltz defended his actions and noted no formal disciplinary action was taken, some senators called the move disqualifying. Despite the controversy, Waltz is likely to be confirmed, with Republicans emphasizing the need for a strong US presence at the UN.</p>

The White House asserted that Trump was merely asking a hypothetical question during a call with Ukrainian President Zelensky and is focused on ending the war. This statement comes as the administration announced it would send more weapons to Ukraine while also threatening Russia with severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days, reflecting a complex and evolving diplomatic strategy.</p>

The Manhattan District Attorney's office reinvestigated the case and found that their confessions were coerced and that exculpatory evidence, including DNA, proved their innocence. Both men were questioned as minors without an adult present and were repeatedly lied to by police. Their vacated convictions mark the 13th such case handled by the DA's Post-Conviction Justice Unit since 2022, highlighting ongoing efforts to rectify wrongful convictions.</p>

          <p>Russia has formally rejected President Trump's demand for a ceasefire deal in Ukraine within 50 days, labeling the ultimatum as "unacceptable." A Russian Deputy Foreign Minister stated that Moscow will not respond to such demands and will continue its military operations until its goals are achieved, though diplomacy remains the preferred path. The ultimatum was tied to a threat of 100% secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia. This firm rejection signals that a swift, negotiated end to the war remains unlikely, despite the new economic pressure threatened by the U.S. administration.</p>
