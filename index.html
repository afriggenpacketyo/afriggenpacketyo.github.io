          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering accepting a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family to serve as the new Air Force One, which has raised legal and ethical questions. The administration plans to retrofit the Boeing 747-8 jet for official presidential use and transfer it to Trump's presidential library foundation after his second term. This move comes as Trump expresses frustration over delays and budget overruns in modernizing the existing Air Force One aircraft, with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg collaborating with Elon Musk to expedite the process. The White House claims full compliance with all applicable laws regarding foreign gifts.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to mutually lower extra tariffs on each other's imports by 115 percentage points and suspend additional 24 percent duties for 90 days, effective by Wednesday. This agreement follows ministerial talks in Geneva aimed at easing trade tensions and includes establishing an economic and trade consultation mechanism. While the U.S. will retain a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports and a 20 percent levy on illegal drugs, China will retain a 10 percent retaliatory tariff on all American goods and tariffs on select U.S. products. Both sides expressed hope that the agreement serves their interests and the world's, aiming to avoid future escalations of trade conflicts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates is expected to prioritize securing business deals worth over $1 trillion, rather than focusing on strategic foreign policy objectives. This trip aligns with the Trump family's expanding business interests in the Middle East, including real estate and golf projects backed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Qatari government is reportedly considering donating a luxury Boeing 747-8 to serve as Air Force One, raising ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Dennis B. Ross notes that the trip is more about economics than strategy, emphasizing financial transactions that Mr. Trump will promote as job creation for American workers.</p>

          <p>A mayoral candidate, Yesenia Lara of the Morena party, and three of her supporters were fatally shot at a campaign event in Veracruz, Mexico. The incident occurred during a procession of motorcycles and supporters, with footage showing people running and screaming as gunshots rang out. Governor Rocio Nahle condemned the cowardly murder and vowed to find those responsible, while the state's attorney general office launched an investigation. This attack is part of a larger pattern of violence targeting politicians in Mexico, often linked to cartels, corruption, and the narcotics trade.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that consuming large quantities of cinnamon may reduce the effectiveness of some medicines, as its main component, cinnamaldehyde, activates receptors that metabolize medication. The health risk may depend on the type of cinnamon, with cassia cinnamon containing high levels of the blood thinner coumarin, which can be hazardous for individuals on blood thinners. Individuals with chronic illnesses should be cautious when using cinnamon supplements, and people should talk to their healthcare providers before using any supplements with prescribed medication. While sprinkling cinnamon on coffee is unlikely to cause an issue, highly concentrated cinnamon as a dietary supplement might.</p>

          <p>A disputed North Carolina state supreme court race that took nearly six months to resolve revealed a playbook for future candidates who lose elections to retroactively challenge votes, observers warn. Democrat Allison Riggs defeated Republican Jefferson Griffin by 734 votes last November. Judge Richard Myers II halted that effort on 5 May and ordered the North Carolina state board of elections to certify the race. Although Republicans have been responsible for bringing election denialism into the mainstream in recent years, the legal strategy Griffin deployed was essentially what Al Gore tried to do.</p>

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accused radical left politicians in California of prioritizing migrants over American citizens by giving illegal aliens access to cash benefits.

          <p>Cognitive neuroscientist Leor Zmigrod argues in her book, 'The Ideological Brain,' that political beliefs aren't just beliefs but also neurological signatures that change our brains over time. Zmigrod defines ideology as a fixed doctrine resistant to evidence and a fixed identity influencing judgment. She distinguishes ideology from culture by its rigid prescriptions and intolerance of deviation. Cognitive flexibility, tested through unconscious assessments, plays a role in one's comfort with change and ambiguity, impacting political views. Ideologies serve as coping mechanisms, solving the problem of uncertainty for our predictive brains.</p>

          <p>Normalcy began to return in India and Pakistan on Monday, in a sign that the cease-fire that halted the most expansive fighting between the two nuclear-armed neighbors in decades would extend past the weekend. Stock markets in both countries jumped on the first day of trading since the agreement was announced late on Saturday. The recent conflict was triggered by a horrific terrorist attack late last month on the Indian side of Kashmir, a territory claimed by both countries. On Saturday, President Trump announced that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with the help of U.S. mediation.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has unveiled Labour's long-awaited plans to cut levels of immigration into the UK. The prime minister said the white paper, setting out proposals for future laws, would make the system "controlled, selective and fair". Key measures include tightened visa requirements for some, loosened visa requirements for others, longer permanent residency requirements, abolishing the dedicated visa for social care providers, and changes to student visa rules.</p>

Disclosure of these fees is the crux of the FTC's rule, which does not aim to eliminate them, but rather to ensure travelers know they exist.

          <p>The Federalist Society, which greatly benefited from President Trump's judicial appointments, displayed surprising ambivalence about his second term at a recent gathering. While speakers generally avoided criticizing Trump's policies (except for tariffs), many expressed concern over the administration's chaos. This critique implied that the procedural barriers preventing rapid change would survive the second Trump administration, hindering conservative deregulatory goals. Some speakers also appeared eager to curb Trump's power, advocating for judicial supremacy even at the expense of executive authority.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found two important building blocks of human speech in wild chimpanzees, one of our closest relatives. A pair of studies finds that chimp communication includes both rhythmic structures and call combinations , two key elements of spoken language. The study of rhythmic structures, which appears in the journal Current Biology, analyzed the drumming patterns of chimps from the rainforests in East and West Africa. The study of call combinations focused on two-call combinations, known as bigrams, and found that there is some shift in meaning when these single calls are embedded into these bigrams.</p>
