          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego is pushing for legislation to prevent the Pentagon from granting full military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Gallego, a Marine veteran, argues that Babbitt's actions constituted an attempt to overthrow the government, making her ineligible for honors reserved for those who defend the Constitution. The Pentagon had initially denied the request from Babbitt's family but later reversed its decision following lobbying from conservative group Judicial Watch. Gallego's resolution aims to put lawmakers on record regarding whether they support honoring an individual he describes as a traitor.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at tightening regulations on direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements, including those on social media and digital platforms. The initiative directs the Health and Human Services department and the FDA to enhance transparency and ensure ads accurately convey product risks. While stopping short of an outright ban, the administration plans to issue thousands of warning letters to enforce existing rules, targeting misleading ads that fail to properly disclose side effects. This move follows previous efforts by the administration to rein in pharmaceutical advertising and addresses concerns from physicians about the ads' influence on patient relationships.</p>

          <p>England delivered a commanding performance with a 5-0 win against Serbia in Belgrade, strengthening their position for World Cup qualification. Manager Thomas Tuchel praised the team for their attacking flair and cohesion, a significant improvement from their previous match. The victory was achieved without key players like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, allowing rising talents such as Noni Madueke and Morgan Rogers to shine and score their first international goals. The decisive win silenced the typically hostile Serbian crowd and provided Tuchel with positive selection challenges as England continues its successful competitive streak.</p>

          <p>New York Giants starting quarterback Russell Wilson has affirmed his commitment to leading the team, even as rookie Jaxson Dart gains attention on the depth chart. Wilson, a 14-year NFL veteran, acknowledged Dart's work ethic but emphasized that his primary goal is to secure daily wins for the Giants. Despite a strong preseason from Dart, who earned the backup role, head coach Brian Daboll has confirmed that Wilson will remain the starter for the upcoming game against the Dallas Cowboys. The situation draws parallels to Wilson's own rookie season when he famously won the starting job over a veteran quarterback in Seattle.</p>

          <p>Oracle's shares soared by 27% in after-hours trading following the company's announcement of massive future growth in its cloud infrastructure business, driven by major AI-related contracts. Despite narrowly missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, the company reported its remaining performance obligations skyrocketed to $455 billion, largely due to new multi-billion dollar deals, including one with OpenAI. Chairman Larry Ellison highlighted the increasing demand for AI, stating he now deals directly with CEOs and heads of state.

          <p>President Trump's uncharacteristic defensiveness regarding documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate is drawing increased scrutiny and speculation. Unlike his usual strategy of confronting scandals head-on, Trump has denied signing a birthday card for Epstein and has sued The Wall Street Journal for reporting on it, while his press secretary dismisses the narrative as a politically motivated hoax. This approach, which contrasts with his campaign promise to release the files, is fueling suspicion that the documents may contain damaging information. Critics argue that the president's attempts to suppress the story and label it a "dead issue" are backfiring by prolonging public interest and intrigue.</p>

          <p>The recent Israeli strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, is analyzed as a significant challenge to the Gulf nation's long-cultivated status as an indispensable international mediator. For years, Qatar has balanced relationships with opposing factions, including the U.S., Iran, and various Islamist groups, making itself a crucial hub for negotiations. This attack on its sovereign territory, however, suggests that Israel, potentially with U.S. acquiescence, now views continued mediation as futile and is willing to risk undermining Qatar's geopolitical relevance. The incident puts the future of Gaza hostage negotiations in jeopardy and may strain Qatar's relations with its powerful neighbors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt on a lower court's ruling that would have forced the Trump administration to spend nearly $5 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress. Chief Justice John Roberts granted the stay amid a legal battle over President Trump's effort to cancel the funds, which he described as "woke, weaponized and wasteful spending." The administration had used a rare "pocket rescission" to prevent the money from being spent before the end of the fiscal year. The aid groups that sued the administration have been given until Friday to respond to the Supreme Court's order, leaving the funds in limbo for now.</p>

This measure aims to help the Labour government adhere to its borrowing rules and control spending amid a volatile global economic environment.

The administration argues the tariffs are necessary for national security, while challengers, including small businesses and states, contend the power to impose tariffs belongs to Congress.

          <p>A district court judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans accused of acting as false electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The judge ruled that the group will not face trial on charges of forgery and conspiracy, delivering a significant setback to the state's Democratic Attorney General, Dana Nessel, who brought the case two years ago. The defendants had signed a document claiming to be the state's qualified electors despite President Biden's certified victory by nearly 155,000 votes. This dismissal marks a major development as similar prosecutions in other states like Georgia and Arizona have also faced procedural delays and challenges.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Downing Street to discuss the ongoing crisis in Gaza. A spokesperson stated that Starmer will raise the "intolerable situation" and demand action from Israel to end the suffering, following Israel's recent strike in Doha and warnings of a ground offensive. The visit is controversial, with dozens of MPs calling for Herzog to be denied entry to the UK over allegations of war crimes, which Israel denies. Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly stated that Herzog must answer to these serious allegations during his visit, highlighting the diplomatic pressure on Israel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists anticipate that key inflation reports this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), will show a 0.3% monthly increase for August. This would push the annual headline CPI rate to 2.9%, its highest level since January, largely driven by price hikes on tariff-sensitive goods. Despite the increase, the Federal Reserve is still expected to proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Policymakers are likely to focus on the stable core inflation reading and the weakening jobs market, viewing the tariff-related price jumps as a one-off event rather than a long-term inflationary trend.

          <p>The contest to replace Angela Rayner as Labour's deputy leader is already revealing potential friction for the new government, with candidates openly criticizing its policies. Contenders like Emily Thornberry, who was not offered a cabinet position, have publicly called out the government on welfare, Gaza, and the wealth tax. Similarly, left-wing candidate Bell Ribeiro-Addy has criticized the government's stance on the two-child benefit cap and an arms embargo on Israel. This public dissent from within the party during the leadership race could create awkward political dynamics and pressure for the government in the lead-up to the November budget, depending on which candidates advance.</p>

Parker's theory has been largely rejected by the mainstream scientific community, but he claims top health officials have shown significant interest in his work. This development suggests the administration's forthcoming report may focus on Tylenol, aligning with Kennedy's long-held skepticism of pharmaceutical interventions and potentially shifting blame from his previous focus on vaccines.</p>

          <p>The trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has begun with two of the five Supreme Court justices finding him guilty of plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss. A conviction requires a majority vote, meaning one more guilty verdict will seal his fate, potentially leading to a prison sentence of over 40 years. Justice Alexandre de Moraes stated there was "no doubt" Bolsonaro led a "criminal organisation" that attempted to prevent his successor from taking office, culminating in the January 8, 2023 riots. The trial will continue Wednesday, with all eyes on the next justice's vote, while Bolsonaro maintains the charges are politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following massive, youth-led protests against government corruption and a since-revoked ban on popular social media platforms. The demonstrations, largely organized by students identifying as Gen Z, turned violent, resulting in at least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries as protesters clashed with police in Kathmandu. The unrest was initially triggered by the social media ban but channeled deeper public anger over perceived nepotism and lavish lifestyles of political elites. In response to the escalating crisis, which included the burning of government buildings, the prime minister stepped down to allow for a constitutional resolution.</p>
