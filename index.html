            <h2>Evangelicals Push Back Against Weaponization of 'Christ is King' Phrase by Extremists</h2>

            <p>Evangelical leaders are actively working to reclaim the phrase "Christ is King" from far-right and far-left groups who are distorting its meaning, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI). The institute's research has shown that extremist influencers are using the phrase to unify behind political missions contrary to Judeo-Christian values, sometimes with the aid of bot networks and potentially with connections to foreign governments. Evangelical leaders emphasize that the phrase is a cry of worship and should not be used to spread hate, particularly antisemitism, underscoring the inextricable link between Christianity and Judaism. The effort aims to ensure that the phrase retains its original meaning of spiritual guidance and love. </p>

            <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted joint sea drills involving helicopter crews from an infantry-based unit, indicating a shift in strategy regarding potential conflict scenarios around Taiwan. The exercises, which featured pilots from the 81st Group Army's aviation brigade, focused on low-level flights and simulated real combat conditions at sea. Experts noted the unusual participation of an infantry-based unit in naval drills, suggesting an increased emphasis on cross-unit coordination and coastal support operations in the event of a Taiwan conflict.

            <p>British Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon jets intercepted Russian aircraft on two separate occasions this week near NATO airspace over the Baltic Sea. In the first incident, RAF Typhoons intercepted a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M intelligence aircraft, and in the second, they intercepted an unknown aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace. The intercepts were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing mission, working alongside Sweden to defend NATO's eastern flank. These were the first intercepts for the RAF since arriving in the region for the air policing operation.</p>

            <p>A 14-year-old girl was killed by a lion near Nairobi National Park in Kenya, prompting increased security measures by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).

This incident follows another recent death where a man was killed by an elephant in central Kenya. Conservationists are urging KWS to improve risk assessments and communication regarding wildlife movement, as well as to equip residential areas with anti-predator deterrent systems to prevent future attacks.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is set to present its case for a potential breakup of Google in the final phase of a landmark antitrust trial. The government argues that Google illegally stifled competition by paying companies to set Google as their default search engine and is seeking remedies such as spinning off the Chrome web browser and potentially selling the Android smartphone operating system. Google contends that the proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, but antitrust experts say the case is defining how digital markets will be regulated. The outcome could significantly reshape the tech landscape and affect the environment for tech innovation.</p>

            <p>British fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea in two separate incidents this week, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The RAF Typhoons were scrambled to intercept a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M intelligence aircraft on Tuesday and an unidentified aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace on Thursday. The intercepts were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing mission. The UK's Minister for the Armed Forces emphasized the importance of these missions in reassuring allies and deterring adversaries amid growing Russian aggression.</p>

Thousands of federal workers are at risk of losing their jobs, and local organizations are facing funding shortfalls for essential programs.

            <p>The United States has been warned to stop being “complacent” and engage with the Global South to consolidate its foothold in its escalating technological competition with China.
Developing countries were expected to play an “increasingly critical” role in advanced technology over the coming decades, and their ties with China would probably strengthen, according to the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. The tariffs imposed by Donald Trump earlier this month are set to deal a particularly heavy blow to developing countries if they come into force after the 90-day grace pause the US president later announced.</p>

The author argues that these actions ignore the hard-won knowledge gained from past crises and risk repeating the human and economic toll of environmental disasters.

The Trump administration's demands for Harvard to appoint a White House-approved external body and shutter DEI programs were rejected, leading to a freeze on federal grants.

The article draws parallels to modern trade wars, highlighting the risks of protectionist measures and the importance of international trade relations. Hitler's focus on tariffs and self-reliance led to retaliatory measures from other countries, strained relationships, and ultimately contributed to the economic instability that preceded World War II.
