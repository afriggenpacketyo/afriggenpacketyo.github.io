          <p>Federal authorities have arrested over 30 individuals, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, in a sweeping investigation into illegal gambling operations. The probe uncovered two major schemes linked to organized crime families: one involving insider sports betting and another centered on technologically rigged high-stakes poker games. The NBA has placed both Billups and Rozier on immediate leave, stating that the league takes the allegations with the utmost seriousness and is cooperating fully with the investigation. The arrests represent one of the most significant corruption cases to involve a major U.S. sports league in recent years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. The White House framed the move as an end to the "Biden Administration's war on cryptocurrency," while critics, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, condemned it as an act of corruption. The pardon comes after reports noted a partnership between a Trump family crypto venture and a trading platform administered by Binance. Zhao had been sentenced to four months in prison as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Industrial conglomerate Honeywell saw its stock rise after reporting third-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year guidance. The positive results were driven by a significant rebound in its aerospace segment and a record backlog of $39.1 billion, indicating strong future demand. The report comes ahead of Honeywell's planned spinoff of its Solstice Advanced Materials business, the first step in a larger plan to split into three separate, more focused companies. Management's optimistic outlook suggests sustained momentum for the remainder of the year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted reports that the Trump administration is negotiating to acquire equity stakes in quantum computing companies like IonQ and Rigetti. The denial follows a Wall Street Journal story suggesting such talks were underway, similar to recent government investments in the semiconductor and rare earth industries. The administration has previously argued for taking stakes in companies receiving federal funds in sectors vital to national security. Quantum computing is considered a critical emerging technology with significant military and economic implications, attracting billions in investment despite not yet generating substantial revenue.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have detailed the sophisticated technology used in an illegal high-stakes poker ring allegedly involving NBA figures and organized crime families. The scheme utilized altered card shuffling machines, hidden cameras, pre-marked cards, and even X-ray tables to cheat victims, referred to as "fish," out of millions of dollars. Prominent athletes were allegedly used as "face cards" to lure victims into the rigged games, which were backed by the Bonanno, Gambino, and Genovese crime families. The illicit proceeds were then laundered through shell companies and cryptocurrency, funding further criminal activity.</p>

          <p>According to sources, an internal Department of Justice memo from September suggests that evidence in the mortgage fraud investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James may weaken the prosecution's case. The memo, written by career prosecutors, reportedly concluded that James derived minimal financial benefit and that vague federal mortgage guidelines would make proving intent difficult. The indictment was later secured by an interim U.S. Attorney appointed by President Trump after the previous one was ousted for refusing to seek charges. This development raises questions about the potential political motivations behind the high-profile prosecution.</p>

          <p>Republican candidate for New York City mayor, Curtis Sliwa, has declared he will organize resistance and be the "worst nightmare" for his Democratic socialist opponent, Zohran Mamdani, if Mamdani wins the election.

The exchange highlights the contentious nature of the race, where both candidates have found unlikely common ground in opposing billionaire influence. Sliwa has remained firm in his campaign despite calls from some billionaires for him to drop out to consolidate support for independent candidate Andrew Cuomo.</p>

These notices are sent when the agency identifies simple clerical or mathematical mistakes on a tax return, but have been criticized for being unclear about the issue and the 60-day response deadline. The legislation, co-sponsored by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bill Cassidy, is intended to help taxpayers correct honest mistakes without needing professional assistance.

          <p>An Indianapolis woman has been charged with murder for allegedly shooting and killing another driver in what prosecutors are calling a road-rage incident. Authorities say Deborah Benefiel, 23, followed 21-year-old Kentrell Settles after he honked at her for not moving at a green light. She then allegedly shouted at him before firing a shot into his car, which struck him in the chest. Police used citywide license plate scanners to locate the suspect within hours. A local prosecutor condemned the "senseless violence," noting that a moment of anger should not result in the loss of a life.</p>

          <p>A former British paratrooper, identified only as Soldier F, has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder for his role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland. On that day, British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civil rights protesters, killing 13. The judge stated that while soldiers had lost discipline and shot fleeing civilians, the evidence against Soldier F specifically did not meet the threshold for a conviction. Families of the victims expressed their disappointment with the verdict but pride in their long campaign for justice, while a veterans' group welcomed the judgment.</p>

          <p>Two senior House Democrats are requesting that the Trump administration release all records related to President Trump's administrative claims seeking approximately $230 million from the Department of Justice. The claims are for damages allegedly suffered during the Russia investigation and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents probe. Representatives Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia argue the claims may violate the Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a president from receiving payments from the federal government beyond their salary. They also raised conflict-of-interest concerns, as former Trump defense attorneys now hold senior DOJ positions that could influence the decision on the taxpayer-funded payout.</p>

          <p>Shares in the French luxury group Kering surged after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline for the third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround. The improvement was largely driven by its flagship brand, Gucci, where a 14% drop in sales marked a significant recovery from the 25% plunge seen in the previous quarter. This positive momentum has built investor optimism that the new management's strategies to revitalize the iconic brand are beginning to take effect. The results follow Kering's recent decision to sell its beauty unit to L'Oreal to reduce debt and focus on its core fashion houses (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is scheduled to release its third-quarter financial results, with Wall Street analysts expecting adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share on automotive revenue of $43.08 billion. While analysts anticipate Ford may beat earnings estimates, there are concerns that the company's guidance for the rest of the year could be disappointing. Investors are closely watching for updates on cost-cutting measures, quality improvements, and the financial impact of tariffs and supply chain disruptions. Ford's performance will be compared to rival General Motors, which recently lowered its projected tariff impact for the year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>New research suggests that a significant number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) may be caused by E. coli bacteria from contaminated meat sold in grocery stores, challenging the long-held belief that they are primarily due to poor hygiene. A study comparing E. coli from UTI patients in Southern California with samples from locally sold meat found that approximately 20% of the infections could be traced to a food-borne source. The study found the highest rates of contamination in chicken and turkey products. The findings reframe UTIs as not just a personal health issue but also a food safety problem requiring supply chain improvements.</p>

One officer was found to have made "highly racist and discriminatory remarks," including calling for a detainee to have a "bullet through his head." The other was recorded laughing about another officer using excessive force and offering to falsify a statement to justify it.

          <p>Ruth Chepngetich, the Kenyan athlete who holds the women's marathon world record, has been banned from the sport for three years for a doping violation. The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) found the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in her system at a concentration far above the legal limit. Chepngetich claimed she had inadvertently taken her housemaid's medication, but investigators found her explanation "hardly credible." Because the failed test occurred after her record-setting run in 2024, she will be allowed to keep her world record. The AIU is continuing to investigate other suspicious material found on her phone.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance sharply criticized a preliminary vote in the Israeli parliament to advance a bill on annexing the occupied West Bank, calling the move a "very stupid political stunt" and saying he was personally insulted by it. Speaking at the end of a visit to Israel, Vance reiterated that the Trump administration's policy is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. The narrow vote was also condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office as a "deliberate political provocation" by the opposition during the Vice President's visit.</p>
