          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in court that she would give back her $20 million settlement from Sean "Diddy" Combs if it meant never having participated in his "humiliating" drug-fueled sex parties, which she called "freak-offs." Ventura described the physical violence she allegedly endured and the posse that covered up his crimes. Combs faces charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, charges he denies. Ventura stated she would trade the settlement for a life free of the "freak offs," which she said caused physical injuries and stifled her career as a singer. The defense implied Ventura was strapped for cash before filing the lawsuit, which she denied.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans. This move follows Nissan's announcement to shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss for fiscal year 2024. The potential closures include Nissan's main Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co. Together, these plants account for about 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The company aims to reduce its global output capacity by 30% by fiscal year 2027.</p>

A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed the Tianxing-1, a small rocket featuring wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase to engage targets. While similar to hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 operates at a slower pace, making it potentially less effective against high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>

          <p>The administrator of an Islamic religious and educational complex in Pakistan denied claims by India that the site is a terrorist hub. The denial follows a May 7 missile strike that killed three people at the complex, which India targeted after blaming Pakistan-based militants for an April 22 shooting in India-administered Kashmir. Muhammad Azam, the administrator, stated that the complex has no ties to any militant groups and is overseen by government-appointed officials. He urged India to engage in peaceful dialogue with Pakistan to address contentious issues.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for much of the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust blanketed the city and suburbs. The National Weather Service confirmed it was only the second time in its history that it issued a dust storm warning. Winds of 60 to 70 mph over dry farmlands caused the dust storm, significantly reducing visibility on major interstates. Showers and thunderstorms mixed with the dust storm, leading to reports of "mud rain." The storms also caused ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports.</p>

The book suggests that Biden's inner circle shielded him from staff, obscuring the extent of his decline. Despite widespread voter concerns about Biden's age, many Democrats publicly vouched for him, prioritizing incumbency and party unity. As Democrats face low approval ratings, some are now admitting that the party made a mistake in backing Biden's re-election bid.</p>

The downgrade, to one notch below the highest triple-A rating, reflects concerns about the government's ability to repay its debt. This marks the third major credit rating agency to downgrade the United States, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs. Moody's report pointed to decades of gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, with both Democrats and Republicans failing to address the growing debt.</p>

The White House blamed the downgrade on the administration of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., while Moody's maintained that the US retains exceptional credit strengths.</p>
