          <p>Michigan's official tourism campaign, Pure Michigan, has launched a line of room and body sprays designed to evoke the state's seasonal scents. The first fragrance, inspired by a Michigan summer, aims to attract visitors by using the powerful connection between smell, mood, and memory. The campaign is part of a larger marketing effort and includes scratch-and-sniff panels in travel magazines to promote the state as a destination for mindful travel. Public reaction to the unique marketing tactic has been generally positive and curious.</p>

          <p>Russia has accused Ukraine of conducting drone attacks that caused a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant, though the blaze was extinguished without casualties and radiation levels remain normal. The alleged attacks on Russian energy infrastructure coincided with Ukraine's celebration of its Independence Day, marking its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. In a defiant address, President Zelenskyy affirmed Ukraine's resolve to continue fighting, while international partners like Canada, the UK, and Norway pledged ongoing support and military aid.</p>

          <p>The White House has identified a list of "objectionable" artworks and programs at the Smithsonian Institution, targeting content focused on race, immigration, and sexuality as part of a review to align the museums with the administration's cultural directives. This move has prompted reactions from the featured artists and scholars, with some calling it a "badge of honor" and others fearing it will create a chilling effect on artistic expression. Critics compare the action to historical instances of political censorship, raising concerns about the freedom of cultural institutions from partisan influence.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Domestic and Foreign Policies Are Guided by Personal Interest</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis suggests that President Trump's policy decisions, both domestic and foreign, are often intertwined and driven by his personal interests rather than a consistent ideology. This approach was highlighted by his recent summit with Vladimir Putin, where he appeared to accept the Russian leader's views on U.S. elections, leading to a proposed executive order on mail-in ballots. Critics argue this conflation of personal grievances with national policy makes him vulnerable to manipulation and marks a radical break from traditional diplomatic norms.</p>

          <p>The popular animated Netflix movie "KPop Demon Hunters" is experiencing a surge in popularity, leading to a limited theatrical release as a singalong event across the United States. The film, about a fictional K-pop girl band fighting evil spirits, has become a cultural phenomenon, with screenings selling out and its soundtrack dominating music charts. This unusual move from a streaming platform to cinemas is seen as both a gift to fans and a strategic promotion that could build the movie into a major franchise.</p>

          <p>North Korea has announced that it successfully test-fired two new types of missiles under the supervision of leader Kim Jong Un. According to state media, the missiles are designed to counter aerial threats such as attack drones and cruise missiles. The launches occurred while the United States and South Korea were conducting their annual "Ulchi Freedom Shield" joint military exercises. North Korea condemned the drills as "reckless" and destabilizing, stating they are pushing the Korean Peninsula toward "extreme tension."</p>

The piece suggests that overcoming their long-standing rivalry, rooted in territorial disputes, requires a pragmatic approach, with restarting trade talks being a potential step toward constructive collaboration.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for US-Taiwan defense ties, it has been revealed that over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in this year's "Northern Strike" military exercises in Michigan. This represents the largest contingent from Taiwan to ever join the American-led drills and marks a departure from the previous policy of not publicly discussing Taiwan's involvement. The disclosure, reported by a Pentagon-linked media outlet, is widely interpreted as a sign of deepening military cooperation between Washington and Taipei, despite the current administration's transactional foreign policy approach.</p>

          <p>A new BBC series revisits the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, the world's deadliest offshore oil rig accident, through the eyes of Shane Gorman, whose father David died in the explosion. The article recounts how the tragedy, which killed 167 men, was caused by a series of systemic safety and communication failures by the operator, Occidental Petroleum. Inspired by his father's work as a safety officer, Gorman later took a job offshore to understand the circumstances of the disaster, which led to sweeping safety reforms in the North Sea oil and gas industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform the asylum appeals system to address what it calls "unacceptable delays" and reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels. A new independent body staffed by adjudicators will be created to hear cases more quickly, as the current backlog stands at 51,000 cases with an average wait time of over a year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the move is a practical step to clear the backlog, which comes amid rising public frustration and protests concerning the use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>A team from the Shanghai Museum is set to begin the first Chinese-led archaeological excavation in Egypt at the ruins of the Sekhmet Temple. The temple is located within the ancient Memphis archaeological site, which was the capital of ancient Egypt over 5,000 years ago. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in cultural heritage cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese team selected the site after a research trip where they surveyed ten different potential locations for the joint project.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, many Estonians are actively preparing for a potential Russian invasion by joining volunteer defense organizations like the Kaitseliit and the Naiskodukaitse. These groups, which are accountable to the Defense Ministry, provide civilians with training in first aid, military skills, and safety protocols. Despite concerns over Russian sabotage like GPS jamming, Estonians express a sense of preparedness rather than fear, bolstered by the country's significant defense spending and its membership in the NATO alliance.</p>

          <p>In response to a more aggressive Russia and heightened security concerns across Europe, France is experiencing a significant increase in applications for its military reserves. The government aims to more than double the number of reservists to 105,000 by 2035, aligning with President Macron's plan to boost overall military investment. Many new recruits cite a patriotic duty to protect their country and a realization that peaceful times may be over, reflecting a broader European trend of reinforcing military manpower.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, has described claims that Chinese ownership of American farmland poses a national security threat as "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total US farmland and argued that restricting such purchases is a form of political manipulation. He asserted that these concerns are being used to undermine agricultural cooperation between the two nations for the political agenda of a few individuals.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' final preseason game, a 30-23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, several backup players made their cases for a spot on the 53-man roster while others made costly errors. Undrafted linebacker Marlowe Wax was a standout, recording multiple key plays including a strip-sack, potentially securing his place on the team. However, the game was marred by turnovers and penalties, with rookie quarterback DJ Uiagalelei throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown, giving coaches difficult decisions ahead of Tuesday's roster deadline.</p>

          <p>The governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, has strongly condemned President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it an "abuse of power" and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." The move is part of a broader administration strategy to address what it describes as out-of-control crime in major Democrat-led cities, with troops already deployed in Washington D.C. Chicago's mayor also expressed "grave concerns," stating that an uncoordinated deployment could inflame local tensions and undermine progress in reducing crime.</p>
