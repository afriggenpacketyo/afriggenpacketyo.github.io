          <p>A top UNICEF official reports that malnutrition in the Gaza Strip has escalated to catastrophic, famine-like levels, creating a dire humanitarian situation on the ground. While some aid has been permitted to enter, it is described as a mere trickle and is wholly insufficient to address the needs of the two million residents. UNICEF is urgently requesting that Israel allow for more commercial traffic, resolve issues blocking dual-use items like water pipes, and permit more aid partners to operate inside the enclave. The official, recently returned from Gaza, emphasized that the only sustainable solution to the expanding crisis is a complete end to the war.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after multiple children became unwell at a summer camp at Stathern Lodge, Leicestershire. Following a report, police attended the scene where eight children were subsequently taken to the hospital as a precaution and have all since been discharged. The East Midlands Special Operations Unit is now leading the complex investigation into what has been declared a critical incident. The police watchdog is also independently investigating the force's handling of initial concerns and whether there was a delay in their response.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day extension of the existing tariff agreement with Mexico, postponing a threatened increase to allow more time for trade negotiations. The current duties, including a 25% tariff on many goods and higher rates on metals, will remain in place. Trump stated that the extension followed a productive call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and that Mexico agreed to terminate its non-tariff trade barriers. The goal is to negotiate a comprehensive new trade deal within the 90-day period, providing temporary stability for the two major trading partners.</p>

          <p>Roblox stock increased by 16% after the company reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations. The gaming platform announced net bookings of $1.44 billion, a 51% year-over-year increase, and reported that daily active users grew by 41% to 111.8 million. Despite the strong growth in revenue and engagement, the company still posted a net loss of $279.38 million. The positive results reflect strategic investments in infrastructure and the creator ecosystem, with the company raising its booking guidance for the upcoming quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Impostor syndrome, the feeling of being a fraud despite evidence of competence, is a common affliction among high achievers and can be exacerbated by curated social media personas. This article explores its psychological roots, noting its prevalence among perfectionists, introverts, and those in high-trust professions like medicine. While some argue it can motivate improvement, it more often leads to anxiety and burnout. To combat these feelings, the article suggests three strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of growth, and building a supportive community of peers to share insecurities.</p>

          <p>Four-time Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen has officially ended rumors about his future by confirming he will remain with the Red Bull team for the 2026 season. Although under contract until 2028, Verstappen had been courted by Mercedes and was reportedly considering his options. He stated that his focus has been on improving the team's performance and that it was time to stop the speculation, as it was always his intention to stay. Verstappen's decision effectively solidifies the likely driver lineup at Mercedes, with George Russell and Kimi Antonelli expected to remain.</p>

          <p>A 20-minute failure in the UK's air traffic control system on Wednesday led to significant travel chaos, causing around 150 flight cancellations and delays that extended into the next day. The problem, attributed to a "radar-related issue" at the national control center in Swanwick, forced a reduction in air traffic for safety reasons. NATS, the service provider, switched to a backup system to resolve the fault but the brief outage created a major ripple effect across the network. Airlines have criticized NATS for the system's second major failure since 2023, which has stranded passengers and disrupted travel plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has unveiled draft proposals aimed at tackling the issue of late payments to small businesses. Under the new plans, large companies that persistently fail to pay their suppliers on time could face substantial fines, and invoice payment terms would be legally capped at 60 days. The Small Business Commissioner would be granted new powers to enforce these rules on companies with over 250 employees. This initiative is a response to research indicating that late payments, estimated at £26 billion, are a primary cause of failure for thousands of small businesses annually.

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, increased to 2.6% year-over-year in June, up from 2.4% in May. The rise reflects price increases in goods affected by President Trump's recent tariffs, as well as higher costs for groceries and gas. This data provides validation for the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, as inflation remains above its 2% target. The report also showed that consumer spending saw only a modest increase, suggesting continued caution among American households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>MMA fighter Conor McGregor has lost his appeal in a civil case where a jury found he had sexually assaulted a woman, Nikita Hand, in a Dublin hotel in 2018. The Court of Appeal in Dublin dismissed his legal team's arguments, which centered on the admissibility of his police interviews and the specific wording of a question presented to the jury. The original verdict, which ordered McGregor to pay over £200,000 in damages plus costs, has been upheld. Speaking after the ruling, Ms. Hand expressed relief and encouraged other survivors of sexual violence to seek justice.</p>

          <p>A recent episode of South Park utilized provocative imagery of Donald Trump not to mock the president himself, but as a vehicle to satirize its parent company, Paramount. The article argues that the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, used Trump as a Trojan horse to comment on Paramount's recent business decisions, including the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and a legal settlement with Trump. By embedding their critique within a high-profile political storyline, they created a pointed and accessible satire that drew widespread attention to the corporate drama, effectively biting the hand that feeds them.</p>

One of the infected cows is reportedly pregnant with twins; under regulations, cattle that test positive for TB must be isolated and slaughtered to prevent the spread of the disease. The area is a buffer zone for TB, and the disease is a significant problem for farm businesses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a plan to revoke the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," a foundational scientific conclusion that allows the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA head Lee Zeldin announced the move, which, if successful, would dismantle the legal basis for numerous climate regulations on power plants and vehicles. Experts warn this represents a radical pivot in U.S. climate policy and a full embrace of fossil fuels. The proposal is expected to face immediate and significant legal challenges from environmental groups, with the case likely to reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The White House has expanded an order to end the "de minimis" tariff exemption, applying it to all countries worldwide, not just China. This rule had allowed small-value shipments, typically under $800, to enter the U.S. tax-free, a loophole the administration says was used to evade tariffs and smuggle illicit goods. The order, effective August 29, marks a significant shift in U.S. trade policy and is expected to have a major impact on e-commerce and international exporters. Experts suggest this move closes a key pathway for bypassing tariffs, forcing exporters to compete differently in the U.S. market.</p>
