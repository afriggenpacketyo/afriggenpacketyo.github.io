          <p>A drive-by shooting outside a River North nightclub in Chicago resulted in four fatalities and fourteen injuries. The incident occurred late Wednesday as a crowd was leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police have confirmed there were multiple shooters in a dark vehicle, but no arrests have been made yet. This event marks the second mass shooting at this location, which previously operated under a different name before being shut down after a similar incident in 2022.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly advanced President Trump's signature tax and spending package after a prolonged overnight session. Republican leaders worked to overcome resistance from within their own party regarding changes made by the Senate, with the final procedural vote passing 219-213. The legislation, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense while cutting health programs, now moves to a final debate and vote. The process highlighted deep divisions and required significant pressure from party leadership and the former president to proceed.</p>

          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, with all 15 people on board surviving the incident. The pilot reported engine trouble and attempted to return to the airport but was unsuccessful, crashing in a wooded area. Injuries ranged from minor to critical, but officials praised the emergency response, noting a recent mass casualty training exercise at the same airport contributed to the successful outcome.

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea in the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, prosecutors revealed key evidence that led to his capture. The case was built on cell phone data placing him near the crime scene multiple times, surveillance footage of his car, and crucial DNA evidence. A breakthrough came when investigators matched DNA from a knife sheath left at the scene to Kohberger's father using a Q-tip secretly retrieved from the family's trash. While the plea deal avoids a trial and the death penalty, the motive for the attack on apparent strangers remains unknown.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that former President Donald Trump shares fundamental qualities with America's Founding Fathers, such as courage and a willingness to sacrifice personal comfort for the country. The author contends that, like the wealthy signatories of the Declaration of Independence who risked everything, Trump abandoned a life of luxury to enter the political arena. The piece criticizes anti-Trump protesters for misunderstanding this dynamic, suggesting they fail to see that his actions align with the founders' spirit of challenging tyrannical overreach and prioritizing the nation's welfare.</p>

          <p>Current and former employees of the National Science Foundation (NSF) are warning that unprecedented budget cuts and political interference from the Trump administration are jeopardizing the future of American science. The administration is accused of undermining the NSF's merit-based grant review process, canceling hundreds of active research grants, and targeting studies related to climate change and diversity. Critics fear these actions will lead to a "lost generation" of scientific talent as funding dries up, ceding the United States' global leadership in innovation to competitors like China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is initiating a program to allow for the adoption of some of its 20,000 laboratory animals, including rats and zebrafish. This move follows plans by the Trump administration to significantly reduce the agency's research and development office, replacing it with a smaller entity focused on short-term, legally mandated projects. Environmental watchdog groups criticize the cuts as a "scientific self-lobotomy," arguing it will abandon long-term research and make the agency more reliant on industry-funded studies, potentially compromising public health and environmental safety assessments.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed budget bill, championed by Donald Trump, is projected to cause significant financial hardship for millions of low- and middle-income Americans. The legislation combines substantial cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food assistance with the extension of trillions of dollars in tax cuts that primarily benefit corporations and the wealthy. According to analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and other experts, households in the bottom 30% by income would experience a net financial loss. Critics argue this represents a betrayal of the working-class voters Trump promised to support. (not investment advice)</p>

Najar argues that true peace cannot be built on denial or abstract ideas but requires both sides to courageously confront the painful reality of the conflict.

The indictment also states that a tranquilizer compound, which Barry Morphew had access to for sedating wildlife, was found in her bone marrow. This evidence suggests she was drugged before her death, supporting the prosecution's theory that her husband was responsible for her 2020 disappearance and murder.</p>

          <p>The United States has secured a trade deal with Vietnam, setting a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports, which is significantly lower than a previously imposed rate. The agreement also includes a steep 40% tariff on products transshipped through Vietnam from other countries to avoid U.S. trade barriers, a practice often associated with China. Analysts suggest this deal indicates that future U.S. tariff policies will likely involve higher, not lower, rates for other emerging markets in Asia.

          <p>The cost for the UK government to borrow money has fallen after a recent surge, with the yield on 10-year bonds decreasing. The initial spike in borrowing costs was triggered by concerns over the political future of Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who became emotional in Parliament following a major U-turn on welfare reforms. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's subsequent expression of support for the chancellor has helped calm market nerves. Analysts believe investors are backing Reeves out of fear that her departure would lead to weaker fiscal discipline and larger government deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Examining the Role of Ultra-Processed Foods and Additives in the American Diet</h2>

          <p>On holidays like July Fourth, Americans often consume ultra-processed foods containing additives like Red Dye 40 and preservatives that are banned or restricted in Europe. While there is growing public concern and a push from health officials to address these ingredients, the article argues that the larger health issue is the overall American diet. High consumption of sugar, saturated fats, and excessive portion sizes are the primary drivers of health problems like obesity and diabetes. The piece suggests that while regulating additives is a positive step, a broader cultural shift towards whole foods is necessary for meaningful health improvements.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, the first of its kind found equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna. The drone vessel, believed to be owned by the powerful Gulf Clan cartel, was not carrying drugs and was likely on a test run. This discovery highlights a technological escalation by drug traffickers, who are moving towards sophisticated, unmanned systems that are difficult to detect and reduce the risk of crew capture. Manned narco subs have long been used to transport cocaine, but this autonomous version represents a new challenge for authorities.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court has issued a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision ensures that access to abortion services will remain legal in the state. The ruling resolves a key legal question that arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The 19th-century statute had created uncertainty about the legality of abortion in Wisconsin for the past several years.</p>

Additionally, the Gunners are exploring options for creative wingers, with interest in players such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. How much the club spends on a striker will likely impact its ability to secure other high-profile attacking players during the transfer window.</p>

          <p>An official report has found that historical investigations into child sexual exploitation cases in Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council heavily redacted evidence provided to the police. The watchdog group stated that some documents were so heavily censored they were impossible to assess, hindering probes into multi-victim, multi-offender inquiries. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules, but has since agreed to a new, more efficient process. The report noted that while past failings led to lost trust, Greater Manchester Police has made significant improvements.</p>

          <p>South Korea is experiencing a significant and growing ideological gap between its young men and women, a trend reflected in recent election results where young men overwhelmingly supported conservative candidates. Experts attribute this divide to several factors, including a backlash against feminism, which many young men perceive as unfairly disadvantaging them. Socioeconomic pressures, such as a hypercompetitive job market and the collapse of traditional marriage dynamics, have fueled resentment. This has created a unique political bloc of "2030 men" who feel alienated by the existing political establishment and are drawn to anti-establishment rhetoric.</p>

His faith was unexpectedly restored during a stop in Shamrock, Texas, on the Fourth of July. The genuine hospitality of the South Asian family running his motel, combined with the simple, shared experience of watching fireworks with other diverse travelers, reminded him of the road's potential for connection. The evening served as a powerful reminder that the journey's meaning is found in its people, not just its places.</p>

          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify examines three key claims about the major legislative bill backed by President Trump. Contrary to White House claims of reducing the deficit, independent studies and tax experts agree the bill would increase the national debt by over $3 trillion in the next decade due to its large tax cuts. The bill also proposes significant reductions to Medicaid spending, which could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance, refuting claims that the program would be "left alone." The bill's tax provisions aim to prevent a large tax hike by extending cuts from Trump's first term. (not investment advice)</p>
