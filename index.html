          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued a humorous apology after the medals and T-shirts for the event mistakenly featured an aerial view of the rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The half marathon, which runs through Newcastle and along the River Tyne, was completed by approximately 60,000 runners who received the erroneous memorabilia. Despite the geographical blunder, which many participants found amusing, organizers have embraced the mistake as a celebration of the entire region. The incident has been dubbed a unique keepsake that will likely be remembered for years to come.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume widespread immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area, temporarily lifting a lower court's order. The previous injunction had barred federal agents from detaining individuals without reasonable suspicion, specifically prohibiting stops based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation. The administration argued the restrictions hampered law enforcement, while dissenting justices warned the decision erodes constitutional freedoms and could lead to racial profiling. This ruling represents a significant development in the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>The French government has collapsed after Prime Minister François Bayrou was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote, creating a major political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron. Bayrou's gamble to seek support for deeply unpopular public spending cuts backfired, as opposition lawmakers from both the far-left and far-right united against him. This marks the third time in a year that a prime minister appointed by Macron has been forced out, highlighting the instability of his minority government. The event triggers renewed uncertainty for France as it grapples with significant debt and legislative deadlock.</p>

          <p>Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing a free doula program, known as Birth Companions, to support expecting mothers in the Baltimore area. Nursing students are trained to offer informational, emotional, and physical support during labor, acting as advocates for patients without replacing medical staff. The initiative, now in its 27th year, aims to provide a more supportive birth experience and has become more accessible following a new Maryland law. This law requires hospitals to permit certified doulas during childbirth, ensuring mothers can utilize these valuable services.</p>

          <p>A business-led initiative to repeal a $30 per hour minimum wage for hotel and airport workers in Los Angeles has failed to qualify for the ballot after falling short on signature requirements. The ordinance, approved by the City Council, mandates phased wage increases culminating in $30 per hour by 2028. Labor groups hailed the failure of the repeal effort as a major victory for working people against corporate interests. The conflict over this wage law has sparked a broader battle in the city, with unions and business groups proposing competing ballot measures on topics ranging from business taxes to city-wide minimum wage.</p>

          <p>Prominent Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives has been named chairman of Eightco Holdings, a public company planning a strategic shift to accumulate Worldcoin (WLD) as its primary treasury asset. The company announced a $250 million private placement to fund the acquisition of the token associated with Sam Altman's biometric identity project. Ives stated his belief that Worldcoin will become the standard for human authentication in the age of AI, justifying the move beyond a typical token strategy. This follows a growing trend of public companies adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies to potentially enhance shareholder value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that rising temperatures are correlated with increased consumption of added sugar among Americans. Researchers found that as temperatures climb, particularly above 68 degrees Fahrenheit, people tend to purchase more sugary items like sweetened beverages and frozen desserts. This trend is more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups, potentially due to differences in work environments and health awareness. The findings raise public health concerns, as excessive sugar intake is linked to a higher risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic issues.</p>

The article outlines three primary avenues for personalized help: credit counseling agencies, debt relief experts, and direct negotiation with card issuers. Credit counselors offer comprehensive financial analysis and can set up debt management plans with lower interest rates. Debt relief companies negotiate directly with creditors to potentially reduce the total amount owed, while issuers may offer hardship programs to those who proactively seek assistance.</p>

          <p>U.S. Congress is considering legislation to establish a national standard for how collegiate athletes can be compensated for their name, image, and likeness (NIL), aiming to regulate what some call a 'Wild West' environment.

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court found no reason to reconsider its previous ruling on presidential immunity and affirmed that the damages awarded were fair and reasonable. The lawsuit stemmed from Trump's denials of Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. The ruling is a significant legal defeat for the former president, who had argued the verdict was excessive and that a recent Supreme Court decision expanded his immunity from such claims.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has made an emergency request to the Supreme Court to allow it to block billions of dollars in foreign aid approved by Congress. The administration argues that a lower court's order forcing it to spend the funds poses a 'grave and urgent threat' to presidential authority in foreign affairs. Aid groups have condemned the move, warning of devastating consequences for global health and humanitarian missions. This legal battle represents a major test of the separation of powers, centering on the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by the legislative branch.</p>

          <p>The collapse of the French government has intensified concerns about the country's massive public debt, sparking fears of a potential new crisis for the eurozone. With a debt-to-GDP ratio of 113% and the largest budget deficit in the EU, France's fiscal instability poses a significant risk to the single currency. Economists warn that political deadlock makes necessary spending cuts politically impossible, leading to higher borrowing costs on financial markets. The crisis in Europe's second-largest economy could challenge the stability of the entire bloc, especially if it leads to further political fragmentation.</p>

Each ticket holder can choose between a lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million before taxes. The winner in Texas will have a significant tax advantage, as the state does not levy an income tax on lottery winnings. In contrast, the Missouri winner will face a mandatory 4% state tax withholding on top of the 24% federal withholding, potentially resulting in a substantially smaller take-home prize.</p>

The case is significant as it tests the president's authority over independent agencies and revisits a long-standing legal precedent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Experts advise focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable loan terms and eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.</p>
