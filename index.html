          <p>Vladimir Putin oversaw Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, amidst heightened security following Ukrainian strikes. Chinese President Xi Jinping was among the international leaders in attendance. Russia had announced a unilateral ceasefire, which Ukraine rejected, accusing Russia of insincerity. The days leading up to the parade saw increased strikes between Moscow and Kyiv, with disruptions at Russian airports. The attendance of China's Xi is viewed as a significant achievement for Putin, as the two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine. Optimism surrounding this event is low considering the ongoing conflict.</p>

DHS stated that Arias-Cristobal admitted to being in the U.S. illegally and has no pending application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, bringing the two countries to the brink of war. Both nations have engaged in missile and drone attacks, prompting international concern. Pakistan accuses India of killing civilians, while India claims to have killed terrorists in Pakistani territory. The conflict is rooted in a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, which has been a source of contention since the partition of India in 1947. The current escalation raises fears of a major conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals imported from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis. This move signals a potential shift away from India's protectionist trade policies, which have historically relied on high import duties. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024. Experts suggest that a trade deal could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its global market access. Concerns remain about the potential impact on India's domestic manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>Chinese government data indicates that shipments of goods out of China increased in April, even as President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods caused a decline in exports to the United States. The increase was driven by trade to other countries in Southeast Asia. Inside China, imports fell as demand continued to weaken. Chinese shipments to the United States plunged by 21 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, but Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent. The central bank cut interest rates and loosened the money taps to direct more money into the economy to encourage businesses and people to spend.</p>

          <p>Albania is holding parliamentary elections, viewed as a critical test of its democratic maturity and EU integration prospects. Prime Minister Edi Rama is seeking a fourth consecutive term, while the opposition remains fragmented. The election's outcome will significantly impact Albania's commitment to fighting corruption and implementing reforms necessary for EU membership. Recent changes to the electoral code aim to introduce preferential voting, but concerns remain about the control exerted by party leaders. The inclusion of candidates under investigation for corruption raises concerns about the integrity of the judicial system.</p>

          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, offsetting a sharp drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Overall exports rose 8.1%, while imports declined slightly. Exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, while exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%. President Trump has imposed tariffs of 145% on imports from China, leading to retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports. The rise in exports may be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July to circumvent U.S. export controls.

The original H20 chip was blocked from the Chinese market after U.S. officials stated it would require an export license.

SMIC forecasts a revenue decline for the current quarter, but its first-quarter capacity utilization reached 89.6%, indicating strong demand.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported aluminum have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, but have failed to revive domestic aluminum production. Rising electricity prices in the U.S. are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The 25% aluminum tariffs have created a significant divergence in regional delivery premiums. The lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power remains the primary barrier for domestic smelting. The tariffs are likely to result in higher prices for U.S. consumers.</p>

Hayden's firing came after criticism from a conservative group accusing her of promoting "radical" content.

          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks. He referred to the high tariffs currently in place, stating they would likely decrease. The meeting in Switzerland signals a potential de-escalation of the trade war. However, analysts caution that negotiations will be lengthy and that systemic frictions between the US and China will persist. Official figures show a decline in China's exports to the US, but overall exports rose by a better-than-expected amount.</p>

Russia has been asserting its presence in the Arctic, leading the U.S. to consider ways to protect its interests.
