          <p>Three Thai soldiers were wounded when one stepped on a landmine along the tense border with Cambodia, an incident that challenges a fragile ceasefire established after recent deadly clashes. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, while the others suffered various wounds. The Thai army has accused Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention by laying new mines, a claim Cambodia's mine action authority denies, stating the mines are likely remnants from past conflicts. This event escalates tensions and poses a significant obstacle to peaceful resolutions in the disputed region.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London's Parliament Square resulted in the arrest of at least 365 people for showing support for the recently proscribed group, Palestine Action. Protesters simultaneously revealed signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," prompting police to make mass arrests. The UK government banned the group under the Terrorism Act, making support for it a criminal offense. Protesters argued the ban infringes on free speech and democratic rights, while the government cited the group's history of serious criminality.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a Monday press conference, claiming it will "essentially, stop violent crime" in the nation's capital, which he described as one of the most dangerous cities in the world. This follows his threats to federalize the city's police force and the recent deployment of over 120 federal agents to patrol the streets. The administration's focus on crime in D.C. comes despite official data from the Metropolitan Police Department showing that violent crime has continued to decrease significantly this year.</p>

          <p>A shooting in Manhattan's Times Square left three people, including two teenagers, injured early Saturday morning. The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a Raising Cane's restaurant before spilling outside into one of New York's designated gun-free zones. Police have taken a 17-year-old suspect into custody and recovered a handgun from the scene. The three victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries and are all in stable condition as the investigation continues into the circumstances of the altercation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to suspend German arms exports to Israel has sparked significant criticism from within his own conservative political alliance. Opponents argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility towards Israel, a concept known as "Staatsräson." However, the decision has also found support from some conservatives and coalition partners, who cite concerns over the Israeli government's recent actions and view the halt as an inevitable reaction to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A shooting near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and the suspected gunman, Patrick Joseph White. The attack damaged at least four CDC buildings, though no CDC employees were harmed. Officer Rose, a 33-year-old former Marine and father, was fatally shot while responding to the incident. Authorities are investigating the motive, with law enforcement sources indicating they are exploring the possibility that the suspect's actions were related to anti-vaccine beliefs.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by a planetary geologist from the University of Georgia. The space rock, which formed 4.56 billion years ago, is estimated to be 20 million years older than our own planet. Scientists believe it originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. They plan to name it the McDonough Meteorite, marking the 27th such rock recovered in Georgia.</p>

The strategy involved targeting key state legislative races in 2010 to gain control of the redistricting process, then using new computer technology to draw highly partisan maps. This effort successfully locked in Republican majorities in Congress and statehouses for a decade, often in states where Democratic candidates won more overall votes, fundamentally reshaping the American political landscape.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, has updated his advice for the current economic climate. He now suggests that a well-diversified portfolio can safely support a withdrawal rate closer to 4.7%, and potentially even higher for today's retirees, around 5.25% to 5.5%. Bengen argues that many retirees are too conservative and could be spending more to enjoy their accumulated wealth by following smart strategies like diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the life and work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who became one of Europe's most celebrated still-life artists, reportedly more famous in her lifetime than Rembrandt or Vermeer. Despite the limitations placed on female artists, she achieved immense success with her detailed and scientifically accurate floral paintings. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist gave her unique access to exotic specimens, which she masterfully rendered in complex, vibrant compositions.</p>

Reports suggest a deadline of October 7, 2025, has been set for the evacuation, after which a full military siege would begin. The plan has been widely condemned by humanitarian agencies and world leaders amid a worsening famine and a rising death toll from malnutrition and military activity in the besieged Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, argues there is no real mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle, a conclusion long supported by agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). He states that the high volume of air and sea traffic in the region means the number of disappearances is statistically normal on a percentage basis. The phenomenon can be explained by a combination of human error and challenging environmental factors, such as volatile weather and complex navigation, rather than any supernatural forces.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins argues that parents who are constantly on their phones are modeling behavior that can hinder their children's success and well-being. She advises parents to be more conscious of their own screen time, such as not keeping their phone on their person at home, to encourage a better "phone-life balance" for the whole family. Instead of scolding children for their device use, she suggests getting curious about their online activities to foster connection rather than conflict.</p>
