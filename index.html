          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 15:01:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its key interest rate steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, acknowledging increased uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly concerning the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies. The central bank's statement highlighted rising risks of both higher unemployment and inflation, creating a potential stagflationary environment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is currently in solid shape, allowing the Fed to remain patient and monitor the effects of tariffs and trade negotiations. The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach as it navigates conflicting economic signals and pressures from the White House.</p>

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, experienced a significant jump in April, reaching its highest level since October 2023. This increase of 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% month-over-month reflects a rush of consumer purchases driven by concerns over potential price hikes resulting from auto tariffs. Cox Automotive analysts noted that the typical spring bounce in used vehicle prices extended throughout April, indicating a stronger-than-usual appreciation.

The Department of Homeland Security cited a State Department memo claiming her visa was revoked due to associations that may undermine U.S. foreign policy, specifically related to creating a hostile environment for Jewish students.

          <p>A federal appellate panel considered cases of two international students, Rumeysa Ozturk and Mohsen Mahdawi, detained by immigration officials after criticizing Israel. The Trump administration appealed lower court orders favoring the students' release or transfer. Arguments centered on whether the detentions violated the students' First and Fifth Amendment rights and the court's jurisdiction. The ACLU argued that Ozturk was detained for her speech, while the Justice Department claimed the Vermont court lacked jurisdiction.</p>
