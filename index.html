          <h2>US Health Department Faces Billion-Dollar Grant Backlog After Administrative Hurdles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:27:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is struggling with a grant backlog exceeding one billion dollars, prompting the agency to consider recalling laid-off staff. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic processes implemented by the Trump administration under a "Defend the Spend initiative," which has stalled funding for critical programs, including services for migrant children and domestic violence hotlines. To meet fiscal year deadlines, the department may need to drastically shorten application periods, placing significant strain on applicants. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between administrative oversight and the timely distribution of essential federal funds.</p>

          <p>President Trump surveyed the extensive damage in Central Texas after catastrophic flash floods resulted in at least 121 deaths and left over 170 people missing. The disaster, which occurred on July 4, was particularly devastating in Kerr County, where a girls' summer camp suffered numerous fatalities. During his visit, the president met with local officials and first responders, describing the event as a "hundred-year catastrophe." The federal government has issued a disaster declaration for the region, enabling FEMA to provide support for the ongoing search and recovery operations.</p>

          <p>The UN human rights office has reported that since late May, at least 798 people have been killed while attempting to access humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip. The majority of these deaths, many from gunshot injuries, occurred near distribution centers operated by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF has disputed the UN's figures, claiming they are misleading and that the deadliest attacks have been linked to UN convoys. The report comes as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue, highlighting the extreme dangers civilians face in obtaining essential supplies amid the conflict.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about the solvency of Social Security, seniors are exploring ways to supplement their retirement income. The article outlines several options for homeowners and those with savings to generate additional funds. These strategies include reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to access their home equity as monthly payments. Another option is purchasing annuities, which provide guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum payment. While personal loans are also a possibility, they come with higher interest rates and add to personal debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Treasury Reports Unexpected June Surplus Driven by Increased Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:19:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence attributed to a significant surge in customs duties and a 13% rise in overall receipts. This surplus has slightly reduced the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion. The increase in tariff collections, which are up 301% compared to the previous year, follows the implementation of broad 10% tariffs on imports by the Trump administration. Despite the monthly surplus, the government continues to face high interest costs on the national debt, a persistent challenge for federal finances. (not investment advice)</p>

As part of his plea agreement, he must provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison.

This article suggests the show serves as a portrait of Gen Z dating culture, characterized by emotional guardedness and anxiety about vulnerability. Many of the young contestants, who came of age during the pandemic, seem to struggle with forming genuine bonds, often appearing suspicious of affection and slow to commit. Despite this, the show's popularity remains high, possibly because viewers relate to the contestants' emotional hesitancy and are drawn to those who dare to be openly enthusiastic.</p>

While national activity is still considered "low," wastewater data and emergency room visits show a clear uptick, particularly in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest. A recent CDC analysis suggests the virus has settled into a biannual surge pattern, with peaks in the summer and winter, driven by the virus's rapid genetic evolution. This rise in COVID-19 coincides with an unusual increase in another respiratory illness, parvovirus B19.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, most notably leading the police response to the 7/7 London bombings in 2005. His leadership also faced intense scrutiny following the mistaken killing of Jean Charles de Menezes by firearms officers two weeks after the bombings. Lord Blair, who joined the Met in 1974, rose through the ranks and was a prominent figure in British policing for decades before stepping down in 2008.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Kehoe, has signed a bill repealing a voter-approved law that guaranteed paid sick leave and inflation-adjusted minimum wage increases for workers. The original measure, passed by ballot initiative just eight months prior, was a major goal for workers' rights advocates but was strongly opposed by the state's Chamber of Commerce. The governor described the paid sick leave law as a burdensome mandate on businesses. In response, advocates have already submitted a new proposal for a constitutional amendment to reinstate the benefits, which would prevent future legislative repeal without another public vote.</p>

          <p>GP surgeries in 15 regions across England are launching a pilot project aimed at reducing long-term sickness absence by helping patients return to work more quickly. The £1.5 million initiative will fund career coaches and occupational therapists who can offer support like exercise classes or CV advice to patients on fit notes. The government states this is a shift from simply signing people off to actively helping them overcome barriers to employment. This comes as officials seek to address the 2.8 million people currently out of the workforce due to health conditions, though GP representatives caution against the measures becoming punitive.</p>

This public rejection follows reports that the U.S. is pressing several African nations to sign agreements to accept such individuals under threat of tariffs and visa restrictions.

          <p>Justin Bieber has released "Swag," a surprise album that marks his first new collection of music in four years, but it has been met with lukewarm reviews from critics. Publications like The Guardian and The Telegraph described the album as having moments of brilliance but ultimately being an "uncomfortable" and "unfiltered cry for help." The album features an alt-R&B sound and includes spoken-word interludes addressing media scrutiny and his personal life. While some praised its nostalgic feel, many critics found the lyrics to be clichéd and the project indicative of the artistic lethargy that has marked his recent work.</p>

However, the commissioner concluded that no rules were broken, as Lowe provided evidence that the 28-day window for registering the donations had not yet passed. Lowe described the complaint as a "malicious attempt" to undermine his inquiry and stated that all financial declarations were being handled correctly and within the required timeframe.</p>

Analysts suggest the rally is also supported by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and potential fiscal expansion, which can be positive catalysts for the cryptocurrency. The sharp price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum as traders were forced to buy back their positions. (not investment advice)</p>
