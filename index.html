          <p>China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, experienced its first monthly sales decline of the year in July, a significant development amid an intense price war reshaping the competitive landscape. The slump reflects broader market pressures, as other major players like Li Auto and Nio also reported delivery drops. In contrast, competitors such as Xpeng, Xiaomi, and Leapmotor saw continued growth, highlighting a fractured market where aggressive discounting has prompted warnings from government policymakers about excessive competition. This shift signals a new phase of consolidation and rivalry within the world's largest EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several German states have expanded their use of Gotham, a powerful AI-driven surveillance software from US company Palantir, raising significant concerns among privacy advocates. Civil rights groups, like the Society for Civil Rights (GFF), argue the technology enables mass data analysis that infringes on fundamental rights by potentially ensnaring innocent individuals without their knowledge. Critics also highlight the opaque nature of the software and Germany's growing dependency on a foreign tech firm with controversial ties. The debate intensifies as the federal government considers a nationwide rollout, despite public backlash and constitutional complaints.</p>

          <p>Singaporean hotel tycoon Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a major corruption case involving the country's former transport minister, Subramaniam Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping Iswaran conceal evidence related to expensive gifts, including Formula 1 tickets, that the minister received while they were engaged in official business. The case has sent shockwaves through Singapore, a nation known for its low tolerance for corruption and highly paid public officials. Ong, who is also facing other charges, awaits sentencing in a scandal that has tarnished the country's clean reputation.</p>

          <p>A new report from the UK-China Transparency think tank suggests that Chinese students at UK universities are being pressured by government officials to monitor their peers and suppress discussions on sensitive topics. The report also highlights instances of academics being warned against covering subjects like Xinjiang or COVID-19's origins, and some facing harassment. This raises serious concerns about academic freedom and foreign interference on British campuses, especially as a new law empowers regulators to fine universities for failing to protect free speech. The issue is complicated by the financial reliance of many institutions on fees from Chinese students.</p>

She recounts personal experiences of being asked to disavow terrorism and facing baseless accusations linking her to radical Islam for criticizing Charlie Hebdo. The article contends that any Muslim who speaks out against Islamophobia, or even expresses their identity through fashion, is often smeared with conspiracy theories about "infiltration" or ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. This creates a hostile climate where French Muslims are paradoxically blamed for both failing to assimilate and for integrating too well.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on a controversial American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, declaring he now "loves" it after being informed she is a registered Republican. The campaign, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had sparked a mix of social media backlash and support, with some critics alleging it had racial undertones. Public records reportedly show Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida. Trump's comments add a political dimension to the cultural debate surrounding the ad, which has also drawn commentary from other political figures like Vice President JD Vance.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a novel system to dramatically increase the survival rate of combat drones. The concept involves fitting small and medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters, enabling them to perform sudden, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers to dodge incoming missiles. According to a paper published in a Chinese defense journal, digital simulations showed this technology could boost a drone's chance of survival to nearly 90 percent.

          <h2>UK Regulator Proposes Compensation Scheme for Mis-Sold Car Finance Deals</h2>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for millions of motorists who may have been overcharged for car loans due to hidden commission deals. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while narrowing the scope for claims, affirmed that some arrangements with particularly large, undisclosed commissions were unfair. The FCA banned these "discretionary commission arrangements" in 2021 but is now considering redress for deals made before the ban. A consultation on the scheme's details will begin in October, with total industry payouts estimated to be between £9 billion and £18 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Begins Rollout of Gonorrhoea Vaccine in Sexual Health Clinics to Combat Record Infections</h2>

          <p>In a world-first public health initiative, the UK has started rolling out a vaccine for gonorrhoea in sexual health clinics to address record-high infection rates. The jab, originally developed for meningitis B, will initially be offered to high-risk groups, primarily gay and bisexual men. Health officials predict the program could prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade and help slow the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains. Sexual health advocates have hailed the move as a "huge win," providing an important new tool alongside existing methods like condoms and PrEP to improve sexual health and safety.</p>

          <p>A BBC Africa Eye investigation using secret filming has exposed a child sex trade in the Kenyan transit town of Maai Mahiu, orchestrated by women known as "madams." Posing as aspiring sex workers, undercover journalists documented two women who admitted to trafficking and prostituting girls as young as 13 to truck drivers and other clients. The report reveals the normalization of child sexual abuse in the town and the vulnerability of orphaned or impoverished children. Despite the evidence being handed to Kenyan police, no arrests have been made, highlighting the immense challenges in prosecuting such crimes and protecting the victims.</p>

          <p>May Davis Mailman, a longtime Trump insider serving as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist, has left her White House role. Sources indicate her departure was voluntary, making her one of the highest-ranking officials to leave during the second term without being forced out. Mailman, who also served throughout Trump's first term and is known to be close to Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, was considered a key figure in establishing the administration's operations. She will reportedly continue as a special government employee to finalize some policy projects before starting her own government affairs firm.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic state legislators has fled Texas for Illinois in a dramatic move to block a vote on a new congressional map that would heavily favor the Republican party. By leaving the state, they deny the legislature the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, effectively halting a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott. The Democrats accuse Republicans of a "Trump gerrymander" and holding disaster relief funds hostage to push the maps through. This high-stakes political maneuver, which could result in fines and arrests for the absent lawmakers, underscores the intense national battle over redistricting and voting power.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian American man, Khamis Ayyad, has died from smoke inhalation following an attack in the West Bank village of Silwad, U.S. officials confirmed. According to the Palestinian health ministry, the fires that led to his death were set by Israeli settlers who targeted homes and vehicles in the area. The incident is the latest in a series of violent confrontations in the occupied territory, which have seen a rise in settler attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence and is providing consular assistance to the family, while Israeli police have opened an investigation.</p>

          <p>The medical procedure of egg freezing is gaining popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility, but it comes with significant costs and no guarantee of a future child. A single cycle can cost over $12,000, and multiple cycles are often recommended to increase the chances of success, a financial barrier for many who lack insurance coverage. Doctors emphasize that there is a considerable drop-off at each stage, from thawing the eggs to fertilization and successful implantation. While biomedical advances may make the process easier in the future, women are cautioned to be aware of the financial and emotional investment required.</p>

CEO Demis Hassabis explained that this technology could revolutionize entertainment and gaming, but its primary goal is to build a "world model" that helps AI understand the physical world. These generated environments can be used as near-infinite training grounds for AI agents and robots to learn new skills in a simulated space before applying them in reality. The development points toward a future where AI can more deeply interact with and comprehend our world.</p>
