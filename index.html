          <p>A recent report from Renmin University indicates that the Chinese yuan's international usage is growing, with its influence index rising by 11 percent in 2024. While the US dollar still dominates, its score slightly declined, whereas the yuan has surpassed the British pound and Japanese yen. The report suggests that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. However, the rise of US-dollar-backed stablecoins is viewed as a potential threat to this expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is set to report its earnings under intense pressure from investors, following a significant drop in its stock price and profits. The decline is linked to margin compression in its Medicare Advantage program and Optum Health physician practices, leading to an abrupt CEO change. Compounding these issues, the company faces both criminal and civil investigations from the Department of Justice regarding its Medicare billing practices. Analysts are closely watching for the company's updated 2025 earnings guidance to gauge its recovery strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polish and allied NATO aircraft were mobilized in response to a significant Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine. The large-scale assault involved over 300 drones and multiple missiles, prompting a high state of readiness from NATO air defense and radar systems for several hours. Ukrainian officials reported shooting down most of the projectiles, but strikes in Kyiv injured at least eight people in a residential building. The incident, which included a drone entering Lithuanian airspace, is seen by Ukraine as a test of NATO's reaction.</p>

          <p>An English zoo on the Isle of Wight has announced the successful birth of endangered red panda twins, a significant achievement for its breeding program. The cubs were born to a ten-year-old mother, Xiao, and a ten-month-old father, Flint, who was brought from Belfast Zoo for this purpose. The species is listed as endangered due to threats like poaching and habitat loss from forest clearance. Zoo staff are closely monitoring the new family via CCTV, expressing cautious optimism for their survival.</p>

          <p>An opinion article examines a criminal referral against Senator Adam Schiff, which alleges he falsified documents to secure favorable mortgage terms by misrepresenting his primary residence. The author analyzes the legal complexities, including potential venue challenges in heavily Democratic districts and the statute of limitations for federal financial fraud. While acknowledging the allegations could appear questionable, the piece concludes that a federal or state criminal prosecution is unlikely due to legal hurdles and the ambiguity of what constitutes a 'primary residence' for a member of Congress.</p>

          <p>Despite forecasting a nearly 288% increase in first-half net profit, shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold have fallen, marking their ninth consecutive session of decline. The stock, which has surged over 2,000% since its 2024 listing, initially rose on the news before investors began profit-taking. Analysts attribute the retreat to a reset in market expectations and concerns over rising gold prices, although some believe the company's valuation has become more attractive. Laopu's growth, driven by expansion and popularity among younger consumers, contrasts with weaker overall consumer spending in China. (not investment advice)</p>

Buttigieg emphasized the need for fundamental change in government bodies like the Department of Education and USAID, rather than simply repairing the damage done by the Trump administration.

          <p>Researchers suggest that children respond differently to ultra-processed foods, with some possessing a stronger 'food reward drive' that makes them more susceptible to overeating. For these children, common advice about moderation is often ineffective, and they may struggle to recognize satiety signals when consuming such foods. Experts recommend that parents of these children create a safer home environment by limiting the variety and availability of ultra-processed items. Instead, they should focus on a foundation of whole or minimally processed foods while allowing processed options in social settings.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact known as a 'soul house.' The print was found on the underside of the clay model, which was designed as an offering tray for the deceased and dates back to the Middle Kingdom period (2055-1650 BC). Curators believe the handprint was left by the maker who moved the object to dry before it was fired in a kiln. This rare and exciting find offers a direct human connection to the ancient craftspeople who are often overlooked in history.</p>

          <p>A new trade framework between the U.S. and the European Union is being hailed as a significant political win for President Trump, though it is not a complete defeat for the EU. The deal sets a 15% U.S. tariff on many major European exports, including cars, which is lower than the threatened 30% but still a major concession from Brussels. In return, the EU has reportedly agreed to open its markets to American exports and make substantial investments in U.S. energy and military equipment. The agreement provides some stability but leaves key details, such as tariffs on steel, for further negotiation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Scotland, President Donald Trump launched into a rambling and largely inaccurate critique of wind power, claiming it was 'killing' the United States. He asserted that wind turbines are the most expensive form of energy, are all made in China, and ruin the landscape, among other grievances. Fact-checkers quickly debunked many of his claims, pointing out that wind power is a significant energy source in countries like Germany and that turbines last much longer than he stated. Critics on social media described the tirade as a 'total mental collapse' and revived his long-standing, personal opposition to wind farms.</p>
