          <p>The WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi have jointly warned of a concerning global increase in outbreaks of diseases like measles, meningitis, and yellow fever, attributing this rise to funding cuts, misinformation, and ongoing humanitarian crises. Measles cases have surged by 20% in a year, reaching 10.3 million in 2023, with a likely continuation of this trend into 2024 and 2025. The organizations are calling for increased funding to address the crisis, especially in fragile and conflict-affected countries, where millions of children are missing routine vaccinations. The call to action comes amidst significant cuts in vaccine funding and global instability. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in at least nine fatalities and sixty injuries, including children, according to local officials. The attack caused significant damage, with drone wreckage triggering fires and raising concerns about individuals trapped under the rubble of a destroyed residential building. Blasts were also reported in Kharkiv, injuring at least two people, as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine. This escalation occurs amidst accusations from former US President Donald Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is impeding peace negotiations by refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea.

          <p>Campaigners are advocating for killers and stalkers to be confined to restricted zones after their release from prison, citing the anxiety and lack of freedom experienced by victims when offenders are released back into the community. Victims feel trapped by current exclusion zones, which prevent offenders from entering areas near their homes, and propose reversing this approach to prioritize victims' safety. Concerns have been raised about potential breaches of perpetrators' human rights, but victims argue that their rights and safety should take precedence. The Ministry of Justice maintains that exclusion zones are in place to protect victims and that offenders face imprisonment for violating license conditions. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard economist, suggests the odds of a US recession are as high as 60% in the coming year, citing indicators like an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and prediction market data.

While official indicators like unemployment remain low, Frankel emphasizes that these are lagging indicators and that real-time estimates of GDP growth are concerning.

          <p>Indonesia has committed to maintaining balanced and constructive relationships with both China and the United States, signaling its neutrality in the strategic competition between the two global powers. Following high-level defense and foreign policy talks in Beijing, Indonesia aims to preserve its strategic flexibility and reinforce its role as a regional power broker. Analysts note that this approach allows Indonesia to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape while strengthening its diplomatic position. The new mechanism could be a good communication channel between Jakarta and Beijing. Optimism score: 65</p>
