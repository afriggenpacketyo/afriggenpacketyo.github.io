        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are preparing for a surge in freight containers from China as importers rush to beat potential tariff increases, with vessel arrivals already showing an uptick. While officials are not calling it a "surge," they acknowledge the increase was expected due to President Trump's August 12 deadline for a U.S.-China trade deal. Despite the anticipated boost for trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies, terminals at both ports are operating below full capacity, and retailers aren't significantly boosting inventory levels, indicating that the cargo flow is still below normal for June. The increase in cargo has put more people back to work on the docks, although looming trade negotiation deadlines may impact volume forecasts for the remainder of the year.

          <p>Authorities have recovered the body of the final missing person after a boat capsized on Lake Tahoe due to a large swell, bringing the death toll to eight. The incident occurred near D.L. Bliss State Park, with initial reports indicating six adults had died, two were rescued, and two were missing. The El Dorado County Sheriff's Office has identified all the victims, including Joshua Pickles, an executive at DoorDash. Coop Cooper, manager of the marina at Camp Richardson, stressed the importance of being prepared for sudden weather changes, noting that conditions on Lake Tahoe shifted dramatically within 45 minutes, bringing high winds and rain.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed frustration with both Israel and Iran, accusing them of violating a ceasefire agreement he announced, stating that "they don't know what the f--- they're doing." Trump indicated that Israel had dropped a significant number of bombs shortly after the deal was made, leading to his displeasure with their actions. He confirmed speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasizing the need to sustain the ceasefire. The agreement involved two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran, followed by Israel, after which the war would be declared ended.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rajan Menon argues that Trump's recent bombing of Iranian nuclear installations and subsequent rumination about regime change risk drawing the U.S. into another "forever war," potentially creating a rift within his own base. While Trump could declare victory after the strike, moving forward with regime change poses significant military and strategic hazards due to Iran's size, population, and the strength of its armed forces. Menon highlights the potential for prolonged disorder and bloodletting in a multi-ethnic country like Iran, as well as the risk of destabilizing the region given Iran's oil exports and proximity to several U.S.-aligned countries. The author suggests that Trump should avoid regime change and instead focus on de-escalation to prevent a quagmire.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Sean "Diddy" Combs in a sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days. The prosecution aims to prove that Combs used his wealth and influence to coerce women into unwanted sexual acts, portraying him as running a criminal enterprise. The defense argues that any sexual acts were consensual and that the case is about love, jealousy, infidelity, and money. The trial included testimony from former girlfriends and assistants detailing alleged orgies, blackmail, and violent behavior, with prosecutors presenting evidence of unregistered firearms, illegal drugs, and security footage of Combs assaulting Cassie Ventura.</p>

          <p>This article compares the costs of a $50,000 home equity loan versus a $50,000 personal loan in June 2025, finding that the home equity loan is cheaper due to lower interest rates. The average home equity loan interest rate is 8.25% compared to the median personal loan rate of 12.65%. A five-year home equity loan at 8.25% would cost $1,019.81 per month, while a personal loan at 12.65% would cost $1,128.72 per month, saving approximately $6,540 over five years with the home equity loan. While HELOC rates are also down, they are variable and carry risk, making home equity loans more predictable. (not investment advice)</p>

The briefing, initially set to include briefers from the Department of State, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, CIA Director, and DNI, has been rescheduled to include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.

However, the event has sparked protests from local groups, including the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, criticizing the city's focus on wealthy tourists while neglecting residents' needs.

It explores the idea of naming heat waves to increase public awareness and promote safety measures, referencing a pilot program in Seville, Spain, that assigned the name "Zoe" to a local heat wave. However, the author acknowledges the challenges of implementing such a system due to the varying scale and temperature thresholds of heat waves across different regions. Despite the difficulties, the author suggests that recognizing heat waves is crucial, especially as they contribute to larger warming trends and mass extinctions.</p>

          <p>A former Department of Justice attorney claims that Emil Bove, a DOJ official nominated for the US court of appeals, suggested the department should consider telling courts "fuck you" when faced with orders blocking deportations. The whistleblower letter alleges Bove stressed that deportation planes needed to take off "no matter what," even if it meant violating court orders. The claim comes in the context of the Trump administration invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport people. The White House and justice department have denied the claims, with one official calling the accounts "falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has increased pressure on Congress to finalize the spending bill, urging lawmakers to remain in session until it is passed. Trump demanded that the Senate lock themselves in a room and complete the deal, emphasizing that no one should go on vacation until the bill is approved. His demands come as the bill faces challenges in the Senate, with Republicans divided over key provisions like the impact on federal deficits and the state-and-local-tax deduction cap (SALT). Despite these obstacles, Senate Majority Leader John Thune insists on moving forward with a vote this week.</p>
