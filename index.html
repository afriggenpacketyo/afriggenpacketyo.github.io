          <p>United Airlines is partnering with JetBlue Airways in a new venture called Blue Sky, marking United's return to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). This partnership allows JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United, and vice versa, also providing reciprocal loyalty benefits such as priority boarding and roomier seats for travelers with elite status. The airlines announced that some aspects of the partnership will begin as early as the fall, but did not provide exact timing or financial details. JetBlue's leaders have stated that they need a partnership to better compete against larger airlines such as United and Delta Air Lines.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $766 million in funding to Moderna Inc. for the development of a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu. This decision comes as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of its mRNA-1018 vaccine, which used the same technology as the COVID-19 vaccines. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness. Public health experts, such as Dr. Ashish Jha, have criticized the funding withdrawal, warning it could put American lives at risk if bird flu becomes more easily spread in people.</p>

          <p>After an extensive search, the remains of LÃ©o Dufour, a 22-year-old experienced Canadian hiker, were found in the Adirondack Mountains more than five months after his disappearance. Dufour had set out on a solo hike to Allen Mountain in late November, equipped for a day trip, but never returned. The search involved 59 rangers who scoured hundreds of miles in frigid temperatures and deep snow. Despite his experience and preparation, something went wrong, highlighting the risks of solo hiking, especially during late fall.

          <p>Google is facing a potential midlife crisis as AI encroaches on its core business of search and advertising. The rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity is challenging Google's dominance, with AI tools providing summarized information directly to users, bypassing traditional web searches. Google is responding with AI Overviews and AI Mode, chatbot-based search experiences powered by Gemini. However, these AI tools are prone to hallucinations and can be unreliable, and publishers are seeing declines in traffic from Google. The future of search may not involve blue links, and Google's supremacy is uncertain in this new AI-powered future.</p>

          <p>The filibuster in the Senate is facing increasing pressure as both parties have chipped away at the 60-vote threshold required to pass most legislation. Republicans recently maneuvered around the parliamentarian to pass a bill striking down a California air pollution law with a simple majority. The next test will be a sweeping bill carrying much of President Trump's domestic agenda, which Republicans are moving through Congress using special rules that shield fiscal legislation from a filibuster. Senator John Thune predicts Democrats will try to abolish the filibuster the next time they are in charge, using the Republican's move as justification.</p>

Vance stated that the administration does not believe stablecoins threaten the integrity of the U.S. dollar, but rather sees them as a force multiplier of economic might. Republicans are attempting to pass the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate digital assets like stablecoins, which are designed to have a stable value against the U.S. dollar.

          <p>UK car manufacturing has plunged to its lowest April output in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and the timing of Easter. The number of vehicles manufactured fell sharply, with only 59,203 vehicles made, the lowest April output for more than 70 years, with the exception of 2020 during the COVID lockdown. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said a wider change in the industry as it shifts from petrol cars to electric vehicles (EVs) had also temporarily reduced output. Despite a recent US court blocking many of Trump's tariffs, the tariff on steel, aluminium, and cars still applies.</p>

          <p>The New York Times podcast, 'The Headlines,' covers several key stories, including President Trump's flurry of pardons, a federal judicial panel ruling Trump's tariffs illegal, and Marco Rubio's announcement that the U.S. will aggressively revoke visas of Chinese students. The podcast also covers Elon Musk's departure from Washington and French crypto chiefs stepping up security after violent kidnappings. Additionally, the podcast remembers Bruce Logan, who helped detonate the Death Star in 'Star Wars,' and Greg Cannom, who made Brad Pitt old and Marlon Wayans white.</p>

          <h2>Easing Housing Crisis with Single-Stair Apartment Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 06:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deceptively simple reform, allowing single-stair construction for apartment buildings up to six stories, could unlock more housing options in the U.S. This approach, common in Europe and other parts of the world, could cut construction costs and allow for more varied unit layouts, including family-friendly three- and four-bedroom apartments. Despite resistance from fire safety officials, who prioritize double stairwells, advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe. Several states are considering or have already adopted legislation to allow this type of construction, potentially easing the housing crunch.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England have surged, with the housing watchdog warning of simmering anger. Complaints are now more than five times higher than they were five years ago, and the Housing Ombudsman said there was an "imbalance of power" in the tenant-landlord relationship. Asbestos, electrical and fire safety issues, pest control and leaks, damp and mould are among the complaints the watchdog receives. The Housing Ombudsman is calling for a transformative overhaul of the current system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>

          <p>The "Make America Great Again" roadshow has arrived in Europe, with events in Poland and Hungary aiming to promote a transatlantic political culture shaped by President Trump's right-wing populism. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Poles to vote for a right-wing presidential candidate. CPAC's next stop will be in Budapest, Hungary, hosted by Prime Minister Viktor Orban. These events come at a moment of peril for transatlantic relations, with Trump's tariffs threatening a trade war with the European Union. Trump's policies are unpopular to Europeans, fragmenting the unity of the global right.</p>

          <p>Democratic senators have alleged that employees of Elon Muskâ€™s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) own lucrative stock in companies that stand to directly benefit from their work gutting federal agencies. The potential ethics violations merit an investigation by the justice department and other oversight bodies, according to a letter co-authored by senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, and Jack Reed. The letter details specific cases where DOGE employees' actions appeared to align with the financial interests of companies in which they held stock, potentially violating federal ethics law. The senators argue that these cases suggest a widespread issue within Doge, where ethics rules are disregarded for personal financial gain.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that proposed cuts to NASA's budget by the Trump administration could halt the exploration of the universe's mysteries, including the possibility of life on Mars and the habitability of Venus. The budget slashes, totaling 24%, would impact space and Earth science missions significantly, leading to the closure of labs and abandonment of deep-space missions. Advocates are highlighting the future discoveries that will not be made and are urging lawmakers to defy the president and preserve NASA's funding. They are also concerned that the cuts will allow other nations to catch or eclipse US leadership in space.</p>

Critics argue that Trump is being duped and that his friendly approach is emboldening Putin. While Trump has hinted at sanctions, he has yet to take action, and foreign policy experts say it's time for a harder line.</p>
