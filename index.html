        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morrisons supermarket chain believes the recent UK-EU trade agreement will ease the strain on food prices by removing trade barriers and reducing complexities in food imports. The chief executive, Rami BaitiÃ©h, expressed optimism about the deal's potential to improve access to key export markets for British meat and fish. Asda echoed these sentiments, anticipating reduced costs and bureaucracy for fresh produce imports and goods moving to Northern Ireland, hoping for a swift finalization to maximize benefits for customers' budgets. Business groups like the CBI and BCC have also lauded the agreement as a significant step forward in EU-UK relations after a decade of turbulence.</p>

          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union met in London to announce a "reset" of post-Brexit relations, tightening trade and defense ties. The new defense agreement allows Britain to participate in European defense efforts, including a 150 billion euro loan program. Trade agreements include relaxing post-Brexit barriers to facilitate the movement of animals and food, enabling British producers to sell raw meat products into the bloc. The agreement also aims to enhance cooperation on illegal migration and includes provisions for European boats to access British fishing waters until June 30, 2038, ensuring stability for fishermen on both sides.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulent trading as investors sold U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar amid concerns about the U.S. economy. A recent credit rating downgrade by Moody's, citing the proposed tax cuts and rising debt, contributed to the market unease. The 30-year Treasury yield rose to its highest level in a year and a half, briefly trading above 5 percent, reflecting diminished appetite for U.S. assets. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, acknowledged the downgrade's potential implications for the cost of capital, while analysts raised forecasts for U.S. yields due to anticipated economic growth and persistent inflation.</p>

This "reset" is championed by UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, emphasizing unity in the face of global instability.

          <p>Financial markets were unsettled by the U.S. losing its last triple-A credit rating and growing worries about the federal government's increasing debt. Moody's downgraded the U.S. by one notch to AA1, citing expectations that the budget deficit will continue to rise under President Trump's tax and spending plans. The yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds climbed, signaling that investors are seeking higher returns for holding U.S. debt, and the dollar weakened against other currencies. Moody's anticipates larger deficits due to rising entitlement spending and flat government revenue, leading to a deterioration in the U.S.'s fiscal performance compared to its past and other highly rated countries.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) has criticized the UK government's new EU deal, calling it a "total capitulation" that sacrifices the Scottish fishing fleet's interests. The deal extends EU boats' access to UK waters for 12 years in exchange for reduced checks on food exports. The SFF fears this will undermine the UK's negotiating power in future discussions. However, Salmon Scotland welcomed the agreement, citing the reduction of red tape for exporters and the potential for new opportunities in EU markets.

          <p>As economic uncertainty persists, annuities are gaining traction as a means to secure retirement income, but experts advise careful consideration before investing. Annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income and market volatility protection through fixed and indexed options, providing tax-deferred growth and no contribution limits. However, they come with fees, limited access to funds, early withdrawal penalties, and complex terms. Experts recommend balancing investments, researching the annuity company's financial strength, creating a financial plan, and reviewing current economic conditions to determine if an annuity aligns with retirement goals.

Trump's threat to "take a pass" if a deal isn't reached leaves the next move uncertain, with possibilities including cutting off aid to Ukraine or stepping back from peace talks. The diplomatic goal is now to win over Trump, with both sides trying to convince him the other is prolonging the conflict.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 11:46:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists suggest that eating habits significantly impact sleep quality, recommending dietary practices to improve nighttime rest. Consuming foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds, oats, and salmon, can aid in the production of serotonin and melatonin, essential for sleep regulation. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables provides sleep-supporting nutrients like fiber and micronutrients. It's advised to avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, and to refrain from drinking alcohol right before bed, as it disrupts sleep patterns. Avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime promotes better digestion and reduces discomfort.</p>

          <p>House Republicans plan to vote on President Trump's second-term agenda this week, but divisions within the GOP conference persist despite the bill's advancement out of committee. House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged that more work needs to be done to address disagreements over issues such as the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Conservative holdouts celebrated a change removing delays from Medicaid work requirements, but sticking points remain on clean energy subsidies and federal payments for Medicaid. President Trump is expected to pressure Republicans to pass the bill, but resistance is anticipated in the Senate.</p>

          <p>China has accused the United States of undermining their preliminary trade agreement after the U.S. issued an industry warning against using Chinese chips, particularly those from Huawei. Beijing "demanded" that the Trump administration "correct its mistakes," calling the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance "discriminatory" and "market distorting." The U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security issued an alert warning of "the risks of using PRC advanced-computing ICs, including specific Huawei Ascend chips," stating they were likely developed or produced in violation of U.S. export controls. This guidance came shortly after the announcement of a "China trade deal" following high-level talks in Geneva.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are puzzled by a recent surge in baby monkey kidnappings among young male capuchin monkeys on JicarÃ³n island in Panama. These monkeys are carrying howler monkey infants, often leading to the infants' deaths from dehydration or malnutrition. The behavior, which started with one monkey named Joker, has been copied by others, suggesting a form of social learning. Researchers speculate that boredom or the monkeys' drive to learn new behaviors may be driving this seemingly pointless and destructive activity. The study highlights the complexity of animal behavior and the potential for seemingly purposeless actions to spread within a group.</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio cautioned that Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating understates the threat to U.S. Treasurys. Dalio argues that credit ratings fail to account for the risk of the federal government printing money to pay its debt, which would devalue bondholders' returns. This warning comes as Moody's cut the U.S. credit rating, citing the government's growing budget deficit and rising interest payments. Dalio's statement suggests that the risks for U.S. government debt are higher than conveyed by rating agencies, impacting the value of money for those holding the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The past week has been particularly deadly for Palestinians, with Israeli strikes resulting in over 400 deaths, according to the Gaza health ministry. Despite the escalating conflict, Israel has allowed a limited amount of aid into Gaza after a two-month blockade, a decision influenced by international criticism and concerns about starvation.

          <p>Scientists have discovered that capuchin monkeys on a small island of Panama have been carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023. The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.</p>
