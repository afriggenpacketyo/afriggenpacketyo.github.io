            <p>Chelsea's struggles against Barcelona in European competitions continued as they suffered a 4-1 defeat in the first leg of the Women's Champions League semi-final. Despite entering the match with optimism under new manager Sonia Bompastor, Barcelona proved too strong, leaving Chelsea with a significant challenge in the second leg at Stamford Bridge. Bompastor acknowledged that her team's performance was not good enough and emphasized the need to learn from the defeat and believe in their ability to turn things around. The return leg will be crucial for Chelsea's hopes of advancing in the competition. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The investigation found that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, and the deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed. However, a spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) dismissed the report as "invalid," asserting that it shifts responsibility to a personal error. The IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic, and the Red Crescent has called for an independent investigation. Optimism score: 25</p>

            <h2>Trump Tariffs Could Cause Summer Economic Slowdown, Says Chicago Fed Chief</h2>

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warns that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer drop-off in economic activity. Businesses and consumers are preemptively stocking up on inventory, leading to an "artificially high" level of economic activity in the short term. Goolsbee suggests that this could be followed by a slowdown as people have already made their purchases. Sectors like the auto industry are likely to be heavily affected.
