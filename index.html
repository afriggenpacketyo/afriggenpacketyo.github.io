          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a chaotic Miami Grand Prix sprint race that began on a wet track after a delayed start. Oscar Piastri initially led, building a four-second advantage, but Norris closed the gap as the track dried. A safety car period following an incident between Alonso and Lawson helped Norris secure the lead. Hamilton finished third, gaining positions after an early pit stop for slick tires. The article details the key moments of the race, including the pre-race drama with Charles Leclerc crashing on the way to the grid, and the strategic decisions made by the drivers and teams amidst changing conditions.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) is expected to resume broadcasts as early as next week after a media watchdog challenged President Trump's executive order that had effectively silenced the network in March. The Department of Justice informed the watchdog group that VOA staff could begin returning to work and programming could resume. The executive order, which aimed to eliminate workforce and activities not required by law at the US Agency for Global Media, was temporarily stayed by a federal appeals court.

          <p>Rodney Hinton Jr. has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly intentionally hitting and killing a Hamilton County Sheriff's deputy with his car. This tragic event occurred a day after Hinton's son, Ryan Hinton, was shot and killed by Cincinnati police during a chase following a call about a stolen car. Police Chief Teresa Theetge stated that the officer who fired claimed the suspect pointed a gun at him, and body camera footage showed an officer saying "he's got a gun, he's got a gun" before shots were fired.

          <p>Two commercial jetliners were forced to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter violating safety standards.

The helicopter reportedly took a scenic route around the Pentagon instead of proceeding directly to the heliport.

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and Columbia University student recently released from immigration detention, has issued a warning about the US's descent into authoritarianism. Mahdawi was detained and ordered deported by the Trump administration for his Palestinian rights advocacy, despite not being prosecuted for any crime. He argues that the government is suppressing dissent and shielding an Israeli government from criticism at the expense of constitutional rights. The article highlights Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford's likening of the Trump administration's crackdown on students to the red scare and the McCarthy era.</p>
