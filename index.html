        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. The museum, which houses treasures evacuated from mainland China, saw visitor numbers plummet from a record high of 6.14 million in 2016 to just 2.87 million in 2024. This decline is attributed to deteriorating cross-strait relations and subsequent travel restrictions imposed by both sides, leading the museum to shift its focus to attracting tourists from South Korea and Japan to reach its visitor targets.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to reduce staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by 1,200 positions and cut thousands of jobs from other intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA stated that the changes aim to align the agency with President Trump’s national security priorities. The move involves reduced hiring and voluntary resignations, and comes as the administration eliminates diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at these agencies. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Rising sea levels threaten South Africa's coastlines, but new research indicates that drought, exacerbated by climate change, is causing parts of the country to lift out of the ocean. Water loss from soil and underground reservoirs lightens the land, leading to an uplift of about two millimeters per year. While this uplift may offer a buffer against rising seas, experts caution against optimism, noting that it comes at the expense of water availability and could worsen drought conditions.
