            <p>Delta Air Lines is scaling back its expansion plans for the second half of 2025 due to disappointing bookings attributed to President Trump's trade policies, which CEO Ed Bastian criticized as detrimental. The airline revised its second-quarter revenue forecast, projecting a potential decline of up to 2% or growth of the same margin, diverging from Wall Street's expected 1.9% growth. This adjustment reflects growing apprehension among corporate leaders regarding consumer spending and the repercussions of certain Trump administration policies. Despite these challenges, Delta maintains its commitment to profitability this year, though concerns persist about weakening corporate and leisure travel demand.</p>

            <p>China has escalated the trade war with the U.S. by imposing retaliatory tariffs of 84% on U.S. goods, effective April 10, in response to the latest U.S. tariff hike that brought levies on Chinese goods to over 100%. This move intensifies the trade dispute between the two largest economies, potentially disrupting global markets and supply chains. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed disappointment in China's unwillingness to negotiate, asserting that the escalation would ultimately harm them more. The tariffs have already spooked investors, leading to significant sell-offs in global equity markets and raising concerns about a potential bear market.</p>

            <p>Walmart has retracted its first-quarter operating income forecast, citing unpredictability stemming from President Trump's tariffs on China, Vietnam, and other significant manufacturing countries. The retailer aims to retain flexibility in pricing strategies amidst the implementation of tariffs, refraining from providing a revised income range for the quarter, though the sales outlook remains steady. This decision aligns with similar concerns voiced by other major U.S. companies, including Delta, regarding the adverse effects of the trade war on business operations. While the near-term operating income is uncertain, Walmart reaffirmed its full-year guidance, citing the negative impact of inflation on consumer spending habits.</p>

The program accounts for nearly 50% of online and app spending, with members shopping and spending significantly more than non-subscribers. Chief Growth Officer Seth Dallaire highlights the program's role as a 'frequency driver,' driving loyalty and allowing Walmart to maintain competitive pricing and invest in other growth areas. Walmart's ability to leverage customer insights from Walmart+ also supports its advertising business and informs product placement decisions, potentially insulating it from the impact of tariffs. </p>

            <p>Experts within the alcoholic beverage industry predict that President Trump's tariffs will lead to substantial price increases for American consumers, exceeding the tariff rates themselves. Importer Bartholomew Broadbent warns that French wine prices could rise by nearly 30% due to compounded costs at each stage of distribution, impacting retail prices significantly. Scotch whisky producers also express concerns about the tariffs' effects, particularly on smaller distilleries that may struggle to absorb the increased costs. These tariffs are expected to negatively impact exporters, distributors, retailers, and consumers alike, potentially pushing certain wines beyond a psychological price threshold.</p>

            <p>Escalating trade tensions between the US and China, marked by tariff increases and retaliatory measures, pose a significant threat to the global economy. The trade in goods between the two nations totaled around $585 billion last year, with the US importing significantly more from China than vice versa. Beyond tariffs, both countries could leverage their control over key resources and technologies to further disrupt trade flows. This trade war could potentially impact other countries by forcing them to choose sides or navigate complex trade relationships amid increasing protectionism.</p>

            <p>Tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, are being used by President Trump to boost the U.S. economy, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit. The recent tariffs include a minimum 10% tax on all imports to the U.S., with significantly higher tariffs on goods from certain countries, including China. Economists anticipate that these tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumers across a range of imported goods, while also causing volatility in global stock markets. While the White House insists that the tariffs will be implemented as planned, they could also damage the US economy and increase the chance of a recession.</p>

            <p>Volatility in financial markets, driven by tariff concerns, briefly caused a sharp drop in mortgage interest rates, resulting in a 20% surge in mortgage demand. Refinance applications saw a substantial increase, while purchase applications reached their highest level since January 2024. The rise in adjustable-rate mortgage applications suggests that homebuyers are seeking ways to mitigate higher prices. However, this surge may be short-lived as rates have already begun to climb again, with analysts suggesting that upcoming inflation data will play a crucial role in influencing rate momentum.

            <p>A New York pediatrician, Stuart Copperman, has been ordered to pay $1.6 billion to 104 women, including a priest in Las Vegas, after being accused of sexual abuse dating back to the 1980s. Despite complaints filed with law enforcement and medical boards over the years, Copperman was never charged with a crime until he approached retirement in 2000, when he was stripped of his medical license. The lawsuits were made possible by New York's Child Victims Act, which temporarily allowed people to file suits over sexual abuse they suffered long ago as children. The completion of the litigation brought a mix of relief and frustration to the victims, who were awarded amounts ranging from $500,000 to $32 million.</p>

            <p>The acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is planning to resign following the agency's data-sharing agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to support the Trump administration's efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. Melanie Krause's resignation marks the third leadership change at the IRS this year, raising concerns among senior agency officials about the legality of the data-sharing agreement. The agreement, signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, has sparked internal debate and prompted some officials to consider leaving the agency.</p>

            <p>A report reveals that top US companies spent three times more on share buybacks than on taxes after the 2017 Trump tax cuts, using their savings to enrich investors rather than lower prices. The analysis highlights how the tax cuts incentivize buybacks, leading to staggering wealth inequality. The companies have collectively recorded nearly $500bn in profits since the last cuts. They enacted $463bn in buybacks and paid just $140bn in federal taxes. With Trump proposing new tax cuts, critics argue that the trend of prioritizing buybacks over investments and wages will continue.</p>

The article addresses concerns about pensions, mortgages, investments, and the cost of everyday items. Economists expect an additional third interest rate cut and, as a result, mortgage rates are falling. With cheaper foreign imports coming from countries like China, Japan and South Korea, it may push the prices down of some products here in the high street as firms compete with each other to attract customers with lower prices than rivals.

            <p>Donald Trump's long-held anger about trade and his fixation on bilateral trade deficits are driving his administration's economic policy, leading to chaotic and potentially damaging outcomes. Trump believes that if the US has a trade deficit with a country, it is "losing" to that country and wants to "beat" them instead. This obsession has led to the implementation of tariffs determined by the relative size of the trade deficit the US has with each country. However, economists have many objections to Trump's trade deficit fixation, including that it ignores that Americans benefit from buying things made in other countries.</p>
