          <p>A tour bus collided with a disabled SUV on State Route 60 near Hacienda Heights, resulting in one fatality and injuries to 32 others. The driver of the SUV was trapped in the vehicle as it became engulfed in flames, while the tour bus, carrying 63 passengers, sustained significant front-end damage after veering into a guardrail. The Los Angeles County Fire Department reported that two bus passengers were in critical condition, and the remaining injured victims suffered minor to moderate injuries. The tour bus was en route to Koreatown from Morongo Valley when the incident occurred, and authorities have stated that neither alcohol nor drugs appeared to be a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 2026 budget includes the Special Education Simplified Funding Program, raising concerns among parents of the 7.5 million students served by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The proposal suggests limiting the federal government's role in education, granting states greater flexibility in using IDEA funding, which could drastically reduce oversight. One example of the potential impact is illustrated by a case in Oklahoma, where a school district allegedly placed a student with Down syndrome in segregated classrooms, limiting her learning opportunities. The article highlights the importance of federal oversight in ensuring a fair and inclusive education for students with disabilities and warns of the potential erosion of these rights if the Department of Education's role is diminished.</p>

          <p>After two days of negotiations in Geneva, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made "substantial progress" toward a trade agreement. While details remain limited, the agreement aims to address national security concerns related to China's trade practices, which the Trump administration views as a national emergency due to unbalanced trade. The U.S. trade representative, Jamieson Greer, indicated that a "deal" had been reached, but it remains unclear whether tariffs will be reduced. The article notes the economic implications of the trade dispute, including disruptions to global supply chains, potential bankruptcies for American companies, and the slowing of global growth.</p>

The article suggests that unless Charles finds a way to heal the rift with Harry, it could define his reign and undermine the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness he has long championed. The palace has pushed back on Harry's contention that his father could have done more to spare him the loss of automatic police protection when he visits Britain, adding to the portrait of a family divided and diminished.</p>
