The children were part of a summer sailing program, and their sailboat sank after the impact, throwing all six occupants into the water. In addition to the two fatalities, two other children are in critical condition.

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a threatened tariff escalation by the Trump administration. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on many EU imports, which is half of the previously threatened rate, and includes provisions for tariff-free trade on certain products like aircraft. As part of the agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over the next three years. Negotiations are still ongoing for some specific items, such as potential exemptions for European wine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An inquest has heard that a 23-year-old woman who died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma had previously refused chemotherapy, telling a court she was "anti-vax." Paloma Shemirani, a Cambridge graduate, died of a heart attack caused by her tumor. She had opted for an alternative Gerson therapy, an unproven diet-based treatment, and had denied her cancer diagnosis, calling it an "absurd fantasy." Her mother, a former nurse who was struck off for sharing conspiracy theories, has blamed doctors for her daughter's death.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. The storm, currently a Category 1 hurricane, is located hundreds of miles south-southeast of Honolulu and does not pose an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Iona to strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves westward over the next couple of days. After reaching its peak intensity, the storm is projected to gradually weaken later in the week.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator is surveying the country's airlines about their future needs for Boeing commercial jets, signaling a potential thaw in trade relations with the United States. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) specifically asked carriers about their fleet renewal plans and any overdue orders with the American manufacturer. The survey follows a meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing senior vice-president to discuss expanding cooperation. This move suggests that Boeing could be a primary beneficiary if a broader trade deal between Washington and Beijing is reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers superstar Luka Doncic has undergone a significant physical transformation during the offseason, detailed in a new feature in "Men's Health" magazine. He has adopted a rigorous new lifestyle in his home country of Croatia, including twice-a-day workouts and a gluten-free, low-sugar, high-protein diet. The change in discipline comes after his former team, the Dallas Mavericks, reportedly expressed frustration with his conditioning. Doncic stated that he is motivated by that narrative and that his new dedication to fitness is "just the start."</p>

The court ordered the foreign secretary to reconsider the decision not to assist the family, who are living in a tent and are at "constant risk of injury or death." The family has a relative who is a British citizen, and the Home Office had already granted them permission to come to the UK in January. However, the Foreign Office had refused to ask Israel to allow their departure, a policy the judge said must be re-evaluated given the exceptional circumstances.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Germany and France have voiced strong criticism of the new trade deal reached between the European Union and the United States. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the agreement would "substantially damage" his country's finances, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called it an act of "submission." Despite the downbeat reaction across the bloc, many capitals acknowledged that the deal, which imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports, was a necessary compromise to avoid a more damaging trade war with the Trump administration.

          <p>Economic analysis of the new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union suggests the deal is unbalanced and will negatively impact the EU's economy. According to advisory firm Capital Economics, the average U.S. tariff on EU imports will rise dramatically, potentially reducing the EU's annual GDP by 0.2%. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturers, European leaders and industry groups have expressed concern over the new 15% tariff. However, many economists note that the agreement provides some certainty and is preferable to the 30% tariff that was threatened. (not investment advice)</p>

The carrier stated the staffing changes are necessary to align with its operational needs during a period of softer-than-expected travel demand.
