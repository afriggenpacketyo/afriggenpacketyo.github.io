          <h2>UK Government Announces Prison System Overhaul to Address Overcrowding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 12:20:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce new legislation to overhaul the prison system in England and Wales, aiming to alleviate severe overcrowding. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled to prison for breaching their licenses will be released after a fixed 28-day period. This move is expected to free up around 1,400 prison places, buying time for ministers to implement more comprehensive reforms. Mahmood warned that without these changes, the government would face running out of spaces for male offenders by November, despite plans to build three new prisons this year funded by a £4.7 billion capital investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent executive order by President Trump aims to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S. by tying them to lower prices abroad, reigniting debate about the high costs faced by American patients. The U.S. consistently pays more for prescription drugs than other high-income countries, almost three times the average of 33 other nations. This disparity is attributed to the complex U.S. reimbursement system and the absence of national pricing controls. While Americans pay more for branded drugs, generic drugs are often cheaper in the U.S., accounting for 90% of prescription volumes. </p>

          <p>Hearing aids are becoming more accessible and technologically advanced, with new options like glasses that double as hearing aids and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) gaining popularity. The article highlights Nuance glasses, which integrate microphones and beam-forming speakers into the frame, costing significantly less than traditional prescription hearing aids. Additionally, devices like AirPods Pro 2 are now being utilized as hearing aids through software updates. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing hearing loss early to mitigate social isolation and cognitive decline, though adjusting to any hearing aid takes time and effort.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, Russia believes it is gaining ground in Ukraine and is taking a hardline stance in cease-fire negotiations. President Putin asserts Russian forces have the advantage and insists Ukraine accept limitations on its military and cede full territory of annexed regions. The Trump administration finds these demands unrealistic, considering Russia's costly and incremental territorial gains. Any success in negotiations hinges on convincing Putin that improved relations with the United States outweigh the benefits of continued conflict, though Russia remains intent on Ukraine's capitulation.</p>

          <p>A large blind taste test conducted by Nectar, a nonprofit researching alternative protein, evaluated 122 plant-based meat products across 14 categories, comparing them to animal meat benchmarks. Twenty of the plant-based products earned a "Tasty award," indicating that at least half of the participants rated them equal to or better than their animal-based counterparts. The article highlights top performers like Impossible Foods, MorningStar Farms, and Tofurky, noting that differences in taste become less significant when the products are prepared in a meal.

          <p>New research indicates that men are twice as likely to die from "broken heart syndrome," formally known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, compared to women. The condition, triggered by severe emotional distress or stressful events, involves symptoms like chest discomfort and arrhythmia. A study analyzing data from nearly 200,000 U.S. adults found that the death rate among women with the condition was 5.5%, while it was 11.2% for men.

However, the data is not easily searchable or downloadable, prompting CBS News to publish the data in a searchable format. The department calculates savings using total potential contract value, a method criticized by experts as an overestimation. CBS News and other outlets have identified errors in the department's accounting, and despite claims of massive budget cuts, spending has increased.</p>
