          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly 20-year-old policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security checks. An internal memo indicates the change will roll out at major airports starting Sunday, with a goal of nationwide implementation soon. This shift, aimed at speeding up security lines, reverses a rule established in 2006 after the "shoe bomber" incident. Passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove their footwear for additional screening.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to aid in its war against Russia, reversing a recent pause in shipments. President Trump stated the support is necessary for Ukraine to defend itself amid ongoing conflict and significant casualties. The Pentagon confirmed the move, which follows concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles that prompted the initial halt. The decision comes after recent calls between President Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia.</p>

          <p>Chinese students are increasingly choosing Singapore over the United States for their higher education, citing cultural similarities, safety concerns, and a more welcoming environment. The article highlights the story of one student who, after three years in the U.S., is now applying to Singapore's top universities. This trend suggests a potential rise in applications to Singaporean institutions as the U.S. loses some of its appeal due to perceived instability and cultural adjustment challenges. Singapore's blend of economic openness and familiar cultural elements makes it an attractive alternative.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that parking lots are the site of one in five U.S. vehicle accidents, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries annually. In some cities like San Bernardino, California, parking facilities occupy nearly half of the downtown area, often featuring poor design and inadequate safety measures. The study links the high accident rate to widespread driver distractions, such as phone use and GPS programming, which are common behind the wheel in these spaces. Poor lighting, faded markings, and potholes further contribute to the risks for both drivers and pedestrians.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 9-1 defeat to the Milwaukee Brewers, largely due to a catastrophic first inning from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The All-Star ace gave up five runs in just two-thirds of an inning, marking the shortest start of his MLB career. A three-run homer by Andrew Vaughn, followed by a series of hits, a walk, and a crucial defensive error by Mookie Betts, sealed the early damage. The Dodgers' shorthanded lineup, missing several key players due to injury, was unable to mount a comeback against Brewers' pitcher Freddy Peralta.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial property renovations, a practice known as "renoviction." The new amendment requires landlords to obtain a government agency order to vacate a unit for remodeling, aiming to close a loophole used to displace renters. This follows a temporary ordinance and is intended to protect tenants from being unfairly evicted so landlords can charge higher rents to new occupants. The city is also developing rules for tenant relocation assistance and penalties for landlords who violate the ordinance.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a provision in a new major bill that would halt its Medicaid funding for one year. The organization argues the measure unconstitutionally targets them for providing legal abortion services, even though federal funds are not used for these procedures. A federal judge in Massachusetts has already granted a temporary restraining order, ensuring funding continues for now. The lawsuit contends that cutting off Medicaid reimbursements would be devastating for the millions of patients who rely on Planned Parenthood for non-abortion-related healthcare services.</p>

Analysts attribute the disappointing forecast to losses in Samsung's foundry business and its delay in getting its advanced HBM chips certified by major clients like Nvidia.

The VA now states that it is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, eliminating the need for mass layoffs. The initial plan, part of a Trump administration push to shrink the federal workforce, had aimed to cut up to 80,000 jobs.

          <p>China has activated another civilian flight route, W121, near the median line of the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, a move that has raised alarm in Taiwan. This is the last of three branches off the main M503 route, which at its closest point is only 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial dividing line. Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration stated the change was a "technical adjustment" to improve air traffic safety and efficiency. However, Taipei views such unilateral actions as a potential security risk and a change to the status quo in the sensitive region.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that investigators found no evidence of a so-called "client list" used for blackmail. The memo detailing the findings confirmed that video footage showed no one entered Epstein's cell area at the time of his death in 2019. The review was initiated to address widespread conspiracy theories and stated that no credible evidence was uncovered that could lead to charges against other third parties. Officials said that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the goal of bringing justice to Epstein's many victims.</p>

Kershaw, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery, said he was completely surprised by the announcement and acknowledged he didn't "deserve" the selection based on his 2025 performance. However, he expressed gratitude for the "tremendous honor," calling the selection "weird but cool." The pick recognizes his storied, future Hall of Fame career, which includes recently reaching the 3,000-strikeout milestone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on order for 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by the vulnerability of such aircraft in modern warfare, as demonstrated in the Ukraine conflict, and a significant increase in the helicopter's cost. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the country must invest in future-oriented capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. This move reflects a growing re-evaluation of the role of traditional attack helicopters on a battlefield increasingly dominated by advanced air defenses and loitering munitions.

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not press charges against individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, even though the event had been officially prohibited by the government. The decision comes after fears that attendees could face fines and organizers, including Budapest's mayor, could face prison time. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created by organizers who declared it an official municipal event. Despite the ban and government opposition, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people in support of LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

Criminal gangs are reportedly using drones to deliver contraband to inmates, who are often bored and living in overcrowded conditions. The annual report highlights that this "uncontrolled criminality" is something that hard-pressed and inexperienced staff are unable to contain. A survey within the report found that nearly 40% of prisoners said it was easy to get drugs, posing a significant threat to safety and order.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally refused to comply with a Trump administration directive to prohibit transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. The federal Office for Civil Rights had concluded that California's inclusive policy violates Title IX and gave the state a 10-day deadline to change its rules. In its response, the state agency said it "respectfully disagrees" with the federal analysis and will not sign the proposed resolution. The refusal sets up a potential legal battle and could expose California to enforcement actions, including the withholding of federal education funding.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic Texas floods that killed over 100 people have raised serious questions about the effectiveness of emergency alerts and whether National Weather Service (NWS) budget cuts played a role. While local officials claimed the rainfall exceeded forecasts, analysis shows the NWS issued numerous warnings, including urgent "seek higher ground" alerts, in the hours before the river crested. However, survivors reported receiving no warnings, and the county lacked a siren system. The tragedy has drawn attention to NWS staffing shortages and the potential impact of funding cuts on the agency's ability to coordinate with local emergency managers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flash flood in Texas serves as a stark reminder of the similar dangers California faces from extreme weather events, according to experts. The state's history includes catastrophic floods, and its topography of hills and streams creates a high risk for flash flooding, particularly from intense atmospheric river storms. While California has stricter regulations on building in high-risk floodways, many communities and infrastructure remain vulnerable. Climate scientists warn that such extreme events are becoming more likely due to climate change, increasing the urgency for robust flood protection and public awareness, especially for vulnerable populations in low-lying areas.</p>
