          <p>Vance Boelter is facing charges for the murder of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as the attempted murder of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.

The FBI revealed that Boelter had a list of 45 elected officials in his car. The surviving Hoffmans are recovering from their injuries as the community grapples with this act of political violence, and Boelter is expected to face first-degree murder charges. </p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ABC News that targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would end the conflict between the two nations rather than escalate it. He defended Israel's actions as preventing a nuclear war and standing up to forces of evil, citing Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East. Netanyahu argued that Iran's regime has spread conflict for half a century, terrorizing the region and bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war. He asserts that Israel's actions are aimed at ending this aggression by confronting these malevolent forces. </p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Vance Luther Boelter with stalking, murder, and firearms offenses in connection to the assassination of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as the shooting of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. According to U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, Boelter went to the homes of four Minnesota state lawmakers with the intent to kill them, planning his attacks carefully and conducting surveillance on their homes. Thompson noted that political assassinations are rare and strike at the heart of democracy, but it is too early to tell if the Justice Department will seek the death penalty in Boelter's case. Boelter's arrest followed a 43-hour manhunt, and doorbell camera footage showed him impersonating a police officer to gain access to the victims' homes.</p>

          <p>The article argues that President Trump is failing the "tyrant test" by using military force to suppress political opposition, drawing parallels to historical definitions of tyranny. It cites the deployment of Marines and the National Guard to Los Angeles to discourage opposition to immigration policies as an example. The author contends that Trump and his supporters are eager for escalation and are portraying multicultural communities as a threat to justify the use of military force. The article concludes by questioning whether those serving in uniform intended to become instruments of tyranny against their own communities. </p>

Payday lenders often charge a flat fee per $100 borrowed, which can quickly add up and result in an APR of nearly 400%. The article also explains how rolling over a payday loan can lead to even higher costs, potentially trapping borrowers in a cycle of debt.

Ticks are small, spider-like creatures that feed on blood and can transmit infections such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. If bitten, the UKHSA recommends removing the tick promptly with tweezers or a tick removal device, cleaning the area, and monitoring for symptoms like a spreading bullseye rash or flu-like symptoms. Precautions include using insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and trousers, and checking for ticks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>Yvette Hoffman, the wife of a Minnesota state senator, shielded her daughter from bullets during an apparent assassination attempt that also killed former Speaker of the Minnesota House Melissa Hortman and her husband Marc Hortman. Yvette Hoffman was shot eight times, and her husband, John Hoffman, was shot nine times but both are recovering in the hospital. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, is in custody and has been charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Authorities found a list of political targets among Boelter's belongings, and the shootings are being called an act of targeted political violence.</p>

There have been near-daily reports of shootings as Palestinians approach GHF food aid centers in Israeli-controlled areas. The UN's OCHA humanitarian agency has warned that Gaza's entire population of 2 million is at risk of famine, and Israel is under international pressure to allow more aid to reach Gazans.</p>

Trump ordered ICE to achieve the “single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” focusing on cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This stance follows a recent fluctuation in Trump's immigration policy, with the administration previously ordering ICE to halt workplace enforcement actions unless related to criminal investigations.</p>

While Netanyahu has personally focused on regime change, the Israeli political and military establishment is primarily committed to setting back Iran's nuclear program.
