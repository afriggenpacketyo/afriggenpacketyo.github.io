          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential trade war before an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a new 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the accord, the EU has committed to purchasing an additional $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing $600 billion more into the American economy. While European leaders expressed relief, some voiced caution about the impact of the new tariffs on transatlantic trade.</p>

          <p>Greece and Turkey are battling devastating wildfires as a persistent and severe heatwave grips the region, with Turkey recording its highest-ever temperature at 50.5°C. In Greece, firefighters are tackling major blazes in the Peloponnese and on several islands, including Kythira, where 20% of the island has been affected. Neighboring Turkey has also seen widespread fires, with authorities in some areas imposing water restrictions. The extreme weather conditions, including high winds in Greece, continue to challenge firefighting efforts, highlighting the severe impact of the ongoing climate crisis on the Mediterranean.</p>

          <p>Bubba Wallace made history by becoming the first Black driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race on the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval. His victory in the Brickyard 400 on Sunday snapped a 100-race winless streak and marked the third, and most significant, win of his career. Wallace overcame a late rain delay, two overtime restarts, and fuel concerns to hold off a charging Kyle Larson. The emotional win was a major moment for Wallace and the 23XI Racing team, co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin, providing a significant boost amid ongoing off-track challenges.</p>

          <p>A regional passenger train derailed in southwestern Germany, resulting in the deaths of at least three people and injuring approximately 50 others, with 25 reported to be in serious condition. The incident occurred near Riedlingen when at least two carriages of the train, which was carrying around 100 passengers, went off the tracks in a forested area. The cause of the derailment remains unclear, but it happened in a region that had been hit by a storm earlier in the evening. Rescue work is ongoing at the scene as investigators begin their inquiry into the fatal crash.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the Harvard-educated mathematician who became a celebrated and influential musical satirist, has died at the age of 97. His darkly humorous and politically charged songs, such as "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "The Elements," gained a cult following in the 1950s and 60s. Despite his popularity, Lehrer largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to teach mathematics and musical theatre. In 2020, he famously placed all of his song copyrights into the public domain, ensuring his witty and incisive work could be freely shared and performed by future generations.</p>

          <p>A video clip circulating on social media has renewed accusations that Donald Trump cheats at golf. The footage, taken during his trip to Scotland, appears to show a caddy discreetly dropping a ball in a favorable position for the former president. This incident has reignited a long-standing narrative about Trump's conduct on the golf course, which was the subject of Rick Reilly's book "Commander in Cheat." The video prompted online ridicule and brought attention to the numerous controversies that have followed Trump's relationship with the sport, from his frequent trips while in office to the promotion of his own business interests.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable display of resilience, England defender Lucy Bronze revealed she played the entire Euro 2025 tournament with a fractured tibia. The 33-year-old Chelsea player was a cornerstone of the team's defense, playing nearly 600 minutes despite the significant injury. Her toughness was particularly evident in the quarter-final, where she scored the winning penalty against Sweden, and in the final, where she played 105 minutes before being substituted. Manager Sarina Wiegman praised Bronze's "crazy mentality," highlighting how her determination to play through the pain served as an inspiration for the entire championship-winning squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the absence of a major panel from Marvel Studios was a notable change at this year's San Diego Comic-Con, many attendees found the experience just as rewarding. The lighter schedule for the famous Hall H allowed fans easier access to other presentations, such as those for "Alien: Earth" and "Tron: Ares." For many, the core of Comic-Con remains the opportunity to celebrate their passions through cosplay, art, and merchandise, rather than just studio announcements. The event's programming also reflected the growing prominence of anime and television, indicating a potential shift in the pop culture landscape away from total superhero film dominance.</p>

          <p>White House budget official Russell Vought, a key author of the conservative "Project 2025" blueprint, suggested President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates. During an interview, Vought downplayed the significance of the Project 2025 chapter on overhauling the Fed, stating he didn't even know what it said. He asserted that the administration's pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell stems from economic policy disagreements and concerns over fiscal management, not a broader plan to undermine the institution's independence, despite the project's detailed proposals.

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza following Israel's announcement of a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in parts of the Strip. The World Health Organization has warned that malnutrition in Gaza has reached "alarming levels" and is on a "dangerous trajectory." Israel stated the pause is intended to allow aid convoys to move more freely, but reports of deadly Israeli fire near an aid route have emerged. While the measures provide some hope, international officials and Gaza residents remain concerned that they are insufficient to address the severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite the historic nature of the England women's football team's victory at Euro 2025, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to announce a special bank holiday. This decision aligns with the precedent set after the Lionesses' previous Euro win in 2022 and the men's World Cup victory in 1966. While a celebratory parade will be held in London, the government appears to be foregoing a national day off, likely considering the economic cost. This comes despite previous suggestions from Prime Minister Keir Starmer that such a significant sporting achievement should be marked with a national celebration.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogacar has won his fourth Tour de France title, concluding the race with a comfortable lead over his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard. Pogacar's dominance was clear throughout the three-week event, solidifying his victory well before the final stage in Paris. This year's final stage featured a new, challenging addition with three circuits of the steep Montmartre hill, a move that drew mixed reactions from the riders. While some, like Vingegaard, expressed concerns about the added stress and danger, the novelty did not affect the overall outcome as Pogacar celebrated his commanding victory.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent right-wing figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters in middle America appear to be unfazed by the controversy surrounding his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews conducted in several states reveal a constituency that remains fiercely loyal, prioritizing issues like the economy and border security over the Epstein matter. Many expressed a belief that the president is being unfairly targeted by a biased media and are willing to trust his leadership on the issue. This sentiment highlights a complex and nuanced view within the Republican base, challenging the idea of a monolithic response to the ongoing scandal.</p>

          <p>This analysis of England cricket captain Ben Stokes argues that he must take personal responsibility for managing his physical well-being to avoid serious injury. Despite visible niggles, Stokes continued to bowl with significant effort in the recent Test against India, and the article suggests that no one on the team can effectively tell him to stop. His importance to the team is immense, as he is a far more threatening bowler than his teammates, particularly with an older ball. However, with a crucial Ashes series approaching, the risk of losing him to a long-term injury is a major concern for England's future prospects.</p>
