          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal murder and stalking charges related to the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The arraignment drew a crowd of supporters and onlookers, with some claiming Mangione is a 'political prisoner' due to Thompson's alleged corporate malfeasance. Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning attended in support of fair legal proceedings. The defense and prosecution are at odds over which trial should proceed first, with a trial date tentatively set for 2026.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, rising separatist sentiments are challenging national unity, fueled by concerns over Liberal Party policies and U.S. President Trump's comments about Canada becoming the 51st state. Some Albertans express a cultural affinity with the United States, even suggesting a potential union. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has warned of a 'national unity crisis' if the new prime minister doesn't address Alberta's demands regarding environmental laws and oil and gas production. While outright separation remains unlikely, the issue poses a significant challenge to Canada's next prime minister.</p>

          <p>Google's Chrome chief, Parisa Tabriz, testified that only Google can effectively run Chrome due to its deep integration with other Google services and 17 years of collaborative development. This testimony is part of the Justice Department's antitrust case, where Google is accused of illegally monopolizing the search market. The DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell Chrome and share search data, but Google argues that Chrome's features, like safe browsing, rely on shared Google infrastructure and cannot be easily recreated by another company. Google also stated that Gemini is the default AI assistant within Chrome.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that listening to a specific sound for just one minute may prevent motion sickness symptoms. The sound, at 100 hertz, stimulates the inner ear and improves balance, potentially reducing lightheadedness and nausea. The study involved exposing volunteers to the sound before activities known to induce motion sickness, such as riding a swing or driving simulator. The findings, published in a medical journal, could offer a new preventive measure, especially relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claims to have saved over $10 billion weekly since President Trump took office. BBC Verify's analysis of Doge's reported savings reveals a lack of evidence to support some of the larger figures. The department's website publishes a running total of estimated savings, but less than 40% of the figure is broken down into individual savings. Furthermore, the accounting errors highlight concerns about the accuracy of the reported savings.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to the murder of a health insurance executive, with the U.S. seeking the death penalty. The judge overseeing the case, Margaret Garnett, cautioned the U.S. attorney general against making public statements that could prejudice the trial. Mangione has garnered support from individuals critical of the for-profit health system. Attorney General Pam Bondi has emphasized the government's intention to seek capital punishment, linking the case to President Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on foreign funding disclosures. The investigation follows a series of executive orders targeting universities viewed as politically opposed to the administration. The Department of Education is investigating UC Berkeley's alleged failure to fully disclose foreign funding. The investigation revives past criticism of the university's partnership with China's Tsinghua University, which the university says they are no longer affiliated with.</p>
