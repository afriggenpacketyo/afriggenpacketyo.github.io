        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawyers representing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez have publicly asserted that she retains her role, contending that only President Donald Trump possesses the authority to dismiss a presidential appointee. This declaration comes after White House personnel reportedly informed Monarez of her firing, a notification her legal team has rejected as legally insufficient and politically motivated. Monarez, a seasoned federal government scientist, was recently confirmed by the Senate under a new law requiring legislative approval for the CDC director, a change enacted during the pandemic. The dispute highlights a significant legal and political challenge regarding the scope of presidential power and agency leadership, especially given her alleged resistance to pressures concerning vaccine experts and returning staff to the office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article posits that a "needs-first" approach, focusing on China's core domestic requirements rather than its perceived international ambitions, is essential to prevent the US-China rivalry from becoming more dangerous. It argues that Beijing's foreign policy is largely shaped by the Communist Party's imperative to ensure internal stability through sustained economic growth, food, and energy security. This perspective reinterprets actions often seen as unbounded ambition as risk management for regime survival, highlighting where China is most vulnerable and offering potential policy leverage. While not a solution to the rivalry, this lens could foster a more stable and predictable bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Best Buy reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter revenue and earnings, with comparable sales rising 1.6%, marking its best growth in three years, driven by mobile phones and gaming. However, the consumer electronics giant maintained a cautious full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts on both consumer spending and its operational costs. CFO Matt Bilunas expressed confidence in sales trending higher but emphasized the prudence of current guidance due to these external pressures. The company has already made "surgical" price adjustments to mitigate tariff-related expenses, highlighting a challenging economic environment for retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

This impressive feat was made even more remarkable as Rafferty completed it with a broken thumb, sustained just last week, and adhered to strict rules including not repeating songs within four hours. He plans to extend his performance to a total of 30 hours, aiming to surpass both the official and unofficial records. The "buskathon," held in Armagh's Market Street, was organized to raise funds for a local Christmas toy appeal, showcasing a blend of personal achievement and community philanthropy.</p>

          <p>Pat Scallen, a Minneapolis resident, described the harrowing and "chaotic" aftermath of the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, where he rushed to help victims. Upon arrival, he witnessed numerous children suffering emotional and physical wounds, including those shot in the head and neck, and focused on comforting them.

The incident tragically killed two children and injured 17 others, predominantly students, during a morning Mass.

          <p>Beijing has strongly criticized the Philippines, accusing it of "courting influence from outside powers" and "making waves" in the South China Sea, thereby jeopardizing regional security and stability. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson explicitly stated that Manila undermines peace and causes trouble in the area, in a veiled reference to the United States. China reiterated that its actions to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights are justified and legitimate, pledging firm countermeasures against any perceived provocative behavior. This exchange signals a significant escalation in the ongoing diplomatic and territorial disputes within the strategically vital South China Sea.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and Fox have successfully negotiated a "short-term extension" in their ongoing contract dispute, thereby preventing an immediate blackout of Fox channels for millions of subscribers. This temporary agreement averts the loss of key networks like Fox Sports, Fox Business, and Fox News, which would have disrupted major sporting events and news coverage. YouTube TV stated it is vigorously advocating on behalf of its subscribers against Fox's demands for "far higher" payment rates, while Fox criticized Google for "exploiting its outsized influence." The FCC chairman also weighed in, urging a swift resolution to the dispute, which highlights increasing tensions in carriage agreements as live programming transitions to streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>The high-profile national security trial of Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has officially concluded, with the court yet to announce a verdict date, though an October decision is anticipated. Lai, 77, has been held in custody since 2020 under Beijing's controversial national security law, facing charges of "colluding with foreign forces" and "publishing seditious materials." His defense lawyers argued that his actions constituted legitimate exercises of free speech, not criminal acts. This case starkly highlights a severe erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong, drawing widespread condemnation from Western governments, including pledges from US President Trump and British Prime Minister Starmer to help secure his release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard's faculty is actively confronting the pervasive issue of grade inflation, where the average GPA hovers around 3.8, despite observations that students are reportedly engaging in less academic work and increasingly prioritizing extracurricular activities. A university committee concluded that most students and faculty agree academics are not sufficiently prioritized, yet paradoxically, students report higher stress levels, feeling compelled to distinguish themselves through highly competitive clubs. This trend, partly fueled by professors' pressures to support student emotional well-being, has led to A's being awarded for diverse reasons beyond excellent performance. Harvard is now attempting to reverse this by standardizing grading policies and re-emphasizing academic rigor across departments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the educational landscape, offering both significant benefits for teachers and new challenges regarding student cheating. A recent Gallup survey indicates that 60% of teachers utilized AI in the past year, with those using it weekly reporting an estimated six hours saved, which can be redirected to direct student engagement. This "force multiplier" for educators streamlines tasks like lesson planning and quiz creation. However, persistent concerns about students using generative AI for assignments are prompting schools to develop clear guidelines and creative workarounds, as the long-term impact on learning outcomes and equitable access to these powerful tools remains a critical area of focus.</p>

          <p>Mexican senators engaged in a physical altercation during a heated debate concerning alleged opposition calls for US military intervention against drug cartels. Lawmaker Alejandro Moreno, leader of the opposition PRI party, and Senate president Gerardo Fernandez Norona of the ruling Morena party, were involved in a public clash, with Moreno seen pushing and slapping Norona. The brawl erupted following accusations that opposition parties were advocating for US military involvement, a claim they vehemently deny. This incident highlights severe political tensions surrounding President Trump's directive for the Pentagon to consider military force against Latin American cartels, a move Mexico has firmly rejected as an "invasion" of its territory.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intensified their bombardment of Gaza City, resulting in at least 16 Palestinian deaths and dozens wounded in the enclave's south, according to local health officials. Residents reported widespread displacement as families fled eastern suburbs, anticipating Israel's full-scale operation to take Gaza City, described as Hamas's final stronghold. This military escalation exacerbates an already severe humanitarian crisis, with the Gaza health ministry reporting 317 deaths from malnutrition and starvation, including 121 children, since the war's onset. Israel disputes these casualty figures and has not publicly accepted a recent ceasefire proposal from Hamas, indicating continued conflict.</p>

This significant event, marking the 80th anniversary of World War II's end and China's resistance against Japan, underscores a visible three-way alignment amidst US efforts to strengthen its alliances in Asia. Observers suggest Kim is emboldened by expanding cooperation with Russia, which provides economic and military aid in exchange for support in Ukraine. The trilateral gathering signals a shared desire to counter US influence, though the precise extent of their alliance remains to be fully seen.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of federal troops in cities like Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, and his musings about expanding this to others, are raising significant constitutional and civil liberty concerns. The article highlights how D.C.'s unique federal status allows easier military deployment, while in states, federalizing the National Guard faces legal restrictions like the Posse Comitatus Act, limiting their law enforcement role. Critics argue this erodes the cultural prohibition against domestic military use, normalizing a dictatorial appearance. The administration, however, appears to be using these actions as "trial runs" to formalize a blueprint for future interventions and to further its immigration agenda.</p>
