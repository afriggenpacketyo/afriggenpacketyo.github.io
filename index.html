            <p>A Chinese delegation visited Brazil to discuss a railway project linking the country to a megaport in Chancay, Peru, aiming to boost Asian trade ties. This follows strategic agreements signed by presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Xi Jinping last November, establishing Brazil's integration with the Pacific as a key pillar in Sino-Brazilian relations. The delegation included officials from China State Railway Group and the Chinese transport ministry, focusing on in-depth studies for railways related to these strategic pillars. The delegation also toured several projects across the country, expressing interest in investment options for the Bioceanic Corridor, a proposed transport route connecting Brazil to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

            <p>Mexican singer Julión Álvarez is set to perform three sold-out shows at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium, marking a historic achievement as the first Latino artist to accomplish this feat at the venue, previously only matched by Taylor Swift. This success follows a long absence due to legal issues stemming from accusations of alleged money laundering and ties to drug trafficking, which were resolved in 2022. Álvarez, known as "El Rey de la Taquilla" for his ability to fill venues, has continued to release music, including his fifteenth album "4218" in February. Beyond the Los Angeles dates, he has also confirmed a concert in Dallas, Texas, with demands for a full US tour.</p>

            <p>US actress Michelle Trachtenberg died from diabetes complications, according to the New York City medical examiner's office. The 39-year-old actress was found "unconscious and unresponsive" in her New York City apartment in February. Officials did not perform a post-mortem examination, but said toxicology tests determined Trachtenberg's cause of death. The US actress was best known for playing Buffy the Vampire Slayer's younger sister Dawn Summers, and later took on the role of manipulative socialite Georgina Sparks in Gossip Girl as an adult.</p>

            <p>An audit of D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) revealed that staffing levels have increased at a rate of seven-and-a-half times more than student enrollment over a five-year period, while student achievement levels remain below pre-pandemic levels for most students. While student enrollment grew by 2.6%, the number of staff increased by 19.5%, amounting to roughly 1,600 new positions funded by the district since Fiscal Year 2020. DCPS claims its staffing strategy prioritizes teachers and has led to increases in enrollment and academic performance. The audit highlights the need for improved data systems to demonstrate the district's fiscal stewardship.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has declared autism a rapidly growing "epidemic" in the U.S., vowing to identify the "environmental toxin" he believes is to blame, noting the rise in autism incidence from 1 in 36 children in 2020 to 1 in 31 in 2022. HHS will announce new studies within weeks, aiming for answers by September. However, some experts and advocates emphasize the need for research rooted in science and facts, citing a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Concerns were raised regarding Kennedy's past statements linking autism with vaccines, an idea that has been thoroughly refuted.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, a Maryland father wrongfully deported to El Salvador, has sparked a constitutional crisis. Despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return, Abrego Garcia remains in detention, with the administration admitting the deportation was an error. The situation has been exacerbated by President Trump's comments about building more megaprisons in El Salvador to house U.S. citizens, raising concerns about due process and the rule of law. Critics argue that Trump is defying federal courts and moving towards a police state, while Democrats are beginning to address the constitutional implications of the case.</p>

Faced with rising inequality , the hollowing out of its manufacturing base and a restless electorate, the US has chosen populist democracy and sovereignty over globalisation.

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Trump's tariffs were generating a “challenging scenario” for the central bank and were likely to worsen inflation. Powell's comments caused US stock markets to tumble, already rattled by a new trade restriction on the chip designer Nvidia. The S&P 500 index ended the day down 2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 3% and the Dow Jones dropped 1.7%. He stated the US economy was well-positioned but added that Trump’s tariffs were likely to cause “at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent.”</p>

            <p>The city of Berkeley, California, has implemented new wildfire safety rules requiring residents in high-fire-risk areas to remove flammable materials within 5 feet of their homes. This measure aims to create defensible space and slow the spread of wildfires, following deadly fires in Los Angeles. The regulations will apply to approximately 1,000 homes in the Berkeley Hills starting next year. Experts emphasize that limiting fuel is crucial for stopping the spread of fires and providing firefighters with more time to respond.</p>

            <p>California has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration's tariffs, arguing that the president has overstepped his authority and that the tariffs are causing harm to the state's economy. The lawsuit challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, arguing that such powers rest with Congress. California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that the state has been disproportionately affected by the tariffs and is asserting itself on behalf of 40 million Americans. The White House dismissed the lawsuit and defended the administration's trade strategy.</p>

The lawsuit, to be filed in federal court on Wednesday by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and attorney general, Rob Bonta, is the most significant challenge yet to Trump’s flurry of on-again-off-again tariffs. The complaint argues that the law does not give the US president the authority to impose tariffs without the consent of Congress.</p>

The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Shandong Shenxing for purchasing over US$1 billion worth of Iranian crude. The sanctioned entities are accused of using ship-to-ship transfers to obscure Iran's petroleum deliveries to China.
