            <p>A 38-year-old man, Cody Balmer, has been arrested and faces charges including attempted murder and terrorism after allegedly setting fire to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence in Harrisburg. The incident occurred early Sunday morning while Shapiro and his family were inside, celebrating the first night of Passover. Fortunately, the family was safely evacuated, and no injuries were reported, although the fire caused significant damage to the residence. Authorities are investigating the motive behind the attack, with a senior law enforcement official suggesting it could be related to Shapiro's Jewish faith, given the timing of the arson on Passover. </p>

            <p>The stars of "Boy Meets World," Danielle Fishel, Rider Strong, and Will Friedle, revisited a Season 6 episode titled "You’re Married, You’re Dead" on their podcast, "Pod Meets World," deeming it the worst in the series. The episode features Cory going to a Hooters-style restaurant, which they felt was out of character and poorly executed. The cast criticized the plot, the jokes, and Topanga’s reaction to Cory's actions, feeling it betrayed her established character. Friedle went as far as to call the entire episode idiotic, citing it as a low point in television. </p>

            <p>The Trump administration is contemplating new tariffs on semiconductors shortly after exempting certain electronics from reciprocal tariffs. President Trump stated that the White House is launching an investigation into semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security concerns. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the electronic tariff exemptions are only temporary and will be replaced by semiconductor tariffs. China is currently America's primary source of electronic products. </p>

Brown argues that threatening and presenting China with zero-sum options is a poor tactic, given China's strong narrative of resisting victimization. He believes Trump's approach is likely to strengthen China's resolve to stand its ground and decouple from the US. </p>
