Despite his individual supremacy, Scheffler's putting faltered in the team format, exposing weaknesses in his game that are often masked in stroke play.

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his new book "Life, Law, & Liberty," reflects on his 30-year tenure, his role as a swing justice, and concerns about the nation's polarized discourse. Kennedy discusses his evolving views on issues like same-sex marriage, influenced by the plight of children with gay parents, and abortion, balancing personal morality with legal interpretation. He critiques originalism, advocating for a dynamic understanding of "liberty" over time, and shares personal anecdotes, including a touching reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia shortly before Scalia's death. The article provides a rare insight into a pivotal judicial figure.</p>

Residents are urged to avoid floodwaters due to the dangers posed by debris and displaced propane tanks. The community is mobilizing volunteer efforts while grappling with widespread damage.</p>

          <h2>Efficacy of Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging Questioned by Dermatologists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the scientific evidence behind collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, revealing skepticism from dermatologists regarding their effectiveness. While some industry-funded studies suggest benefits, independent research shows no significant impact on skin hydration, elasticity, or wrinkles. Experts explain that collagen, a large molecule, struggles to reach the dermis after oral consumption, and topical creams are ineffective. Instead of supplements, dermatologists recommend proven methods like sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking for skin health, along with professional treatments like laser stimulation and microneedling.</p>

          <p>Marking 50 years of China-EU diplomatic relations, this article reflects on China's remarkable technological and industrial modernization, questioning whether it has now significantly surpassed Europe. Early observations by European officials five decades ago indicated China was at least two decades behind in science, technology, and industry. However, China's "reform and opening up" policy spurred decades of rapid, unprecedented growth, fundamentally transforming its global standing. The piece suggests a historical shift in technological leadership, with China emerging as a formidable and increasingly dominant competitor in the race for a high-tech future.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of federal troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing "Full Force" against what he terms "Antifa" and "domestic terrorists" targeting ICE facilities. This directive faces strong opposition from Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who deem it an abuse of power and unnecessary, asserting the city is safe and calm. The move follows ongoing protests at Portland's ICE facility and comes amid a broader federal crackdown on illegal immigration, raising significant concerns about civil liberties and federal overreach. Legal experts question the designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, citing First Amendment challenges, while local officials accuse ICE of targeting non-dangerous individuals.</p>

While Humberto is not expected to make landfall, the interaction could slightly alter paths.

This act continues Trump's repeated criticisms of Powell's monetary policy, despite the Fed's recent rate cut. Firing a Fed chair is unprecedented, and a recent Supreme Court decision indicated the president lacks the authority to do so at will. The financial markets have shown little reaction to these threats, but economists warn that such actions could undermine the Fed's independence and cause long-term interest rate instability.</p>

This escalation occurs as international pressure for a ceasefire intensifies, yet Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains defiant, stating Israel "must finish the job" against Hamas at the UN General Assembly. Many delegates walked out during his speech, highlighting Israel's increasing isolation. U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Netanyahu amid reports of intense negotiations for a deal to end the fighting and return hostages.</p>

          <p>No. 21 USC suffered a last-second 34-32 loss to No. 23 Illinois, with the team's performance marred by numerous mistakes, penalties, and defensive struggles. Despite a late-game fumble recovery and a go-ahead touchdown, USC's defense faltered again, allowing Illinois to move into field-goal range for the win. Coach Lincoln Riley defended his clock management, but acknowledged defensive shortcomings, including giving up over 500 yards. The Trojans battled through injuries, but self-inflicted errors and inconsistent play from quarterback Jayden Maiava ultimately proved costly in this crucial matchup.</p>

He specifically targeted Reform's proposal to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for migrants, arguing it would "tear this country apart." Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also weighed in, stating legal migration is good but should be linked to community contribution, reflecting the ongoing debate on immigration policy.</p>

While critics condemned the agents, proponents argue kneeling was a tactic to de-escalate tensions and foster community relations.
