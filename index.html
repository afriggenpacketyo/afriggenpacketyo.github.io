          <p>Virginia Giuffre's brother has called on King Charles to strip Prince Andrew of his "prince" title, even after Andrew announced he would voluntarily stop using other royal designations, including Duke of York. This plea comes as a posthumous memoir by Ms. Giuffre, who alleged sexual assault by the prince when she was 17, is slated for publication next week, promising to intensify scrutiny. Her brother believes this development vindicates his sister's long-standing claims and signifies a crucial moment where survivors are no longer silent in the pursuit of justice. Prince Andrew has consistently and vigorously denied all accusations against him, but faces increasing pressure over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans participated in "No Kings" protests across the country, voicing strong opposition to President Trump's administration, particularly its immigration crackdown and the deployment of troops in U.S. cities. Organizers, including the American Civil Liberties Union and MoveOn, reported participation numbers potentially rivaling the first Earth Day, emphasizing that the demonstrations were rooted in a "fierce love for our country." Republicans, however, criticized the rallies as "Hate America" events, accusing them of prolonging the federal government shutdown and attracting radical elements. Despite this political rhetoric and heightened law enforcement vigilance, the protests remained overwhelmingly peaceful, with no immediate reports of violent incidents or arrests.</p>

          <p>Human female remains found in a shallow grave at an abandoned school are "believed to be" 23-year-old Kada Scott, a Philadelphia woman who had been missing for two weeks, police announced. The tragic discovery followed a "very specific" anonymous tip, with the medical examiner's office now working to formally confirm the identity of the remains and determine a cause of death. Police had previously located items believed to belong to Scott at the same school grounds earlier in the week. Keon King, 21, was previously charged with kidnapping in connection with her disappearance, as evidence indicated he was the last person in contact with her. Scott's family had expressed deep concern due to harassing phone calls she received before vanishing.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor found herself in uncharted territory while investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski, as the case led her back to her Pennsylvania hometown and a former high school acquaintance. The reporter discovered that Heather Snyder, whom she crowned homecoming queen, was Shymanski's ex-wife and had reported him missing, while Snyder's ex-boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, became the prime suspect. Snyder, who denies any involvement, invoked her Fifth Amendment rights at Holbrook's trial, where he was ultimately convicted of first-degree, premeditated murder. This article delves into the complexities of the case, including the Shymanski family's suspicions against Snyder and the unique challenges of reporting on such personal connections.</p>

          <p>A major Southern California freeway, Interstate 5, was closed for several hours due to a live-fire military event at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance, despite prior assurances from the U.S. Marine Corps that no public routes would be affected. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as an "absurd show of force" from the Trump administration, citing public safety risks from live munitions being fired over the busy highway. State officials, including the California Highway Patrol, recommended the closure due to extreme life safety risks and potential driver distraction. The Marine Corps, celebrating its 250th anniversary, stated it did not request the closure and emphasized the importance of realistic training for homeland defense.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump of prioritizing ego over responsibility after a military showcase, involving live artillery shells fired over a major highway, forced the closure of Interstate 5. Newsom condemned the event as an "absurd show of force" and dangerous, asserting that it was "totally uncalled for" and beneath the office of the President. While U.S. Marine officials maintained the exercise was safe and routine, the California Highway Patrol ordered the closure due to safety risks and driver distraction from live ammunition being discharged directly over the freeway. This incident underscores the escalating tensions between the Democratic governor and the Trump administration, occurring concurrently with "No Kings" rallies across the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced it has "credible reports" indicating an "imminent" attack by Hamas on civilians within Gaza, which would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ongoing ceasefire agreement. This critical warning comes amidst the first phase of the ceasefire, which has seen Hamas release living hostages and Israel free Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of the deal. President Trump had previously cautioned Hamas against civilian killings, although he clarified that he would not deploy U.S. troops to the region. Separately, 11 members of one Palestinian family were tragically killed by an Israeli tank shell, marking the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the ceasefire commenced.</p>

          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, is emerging as a significant player in China's strategic efforts to reduce its dependence on Dutch giant ASML for crucial chipmaking machines. Founded in February as a spin-off from the state-owned Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), AMIES aims to commercialize advanced lithography equipment more rapidly, addressing a critical national bottleneck. China currently lags global leaders in this technology and faces severe restrictions on acquiring top-tier deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems from ASML due to U.S. export controls. While SMEE excels in back-end semiconductor processes, AMIES's focus on front-end tools offers renewed optimism for China's ambitious semiconductor self-sufficiency goals. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative aims to enable business travelers to "work from the air," reflecting a significant shift in travel preferences and airlines' efforts to enhance customer experience and competitiveness.

Verstappen later clinched an imperious pole position for the main grand prix, underlining McLaren's struggle to match his pace this weekend and intensifying the already fierce title race.

          <p>Hamas transferred the bodies of two more possible hostages to Israel, bringing the total remains returned to at least 10, with 16 still unaccounted for, according to Israel's military. This exchange is part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, which also involved Hamas releasing 20 living hostages and Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Tensions quickly arose when Israel's Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced the critical southern Gaza border crossing of Rafah would not reopen until Hamas fully complied with the agreement. This development coincides with a U.S. State Department warning about an imminent Hamas attack on Palestinian civilians, further complicating the fragile peace in the region.</p>

The most recent operation destroyed a submarine carrying fentanyl and other illegal narcotics, with two survivors repatriated for prosecution, while at least 19 people have died in six such strikes since last month.

For decades, China relied heavily on potassium salt imports from North America due to its severe domestic scarcity, holding less than 4% of global reserves. The "potassium railway" thus signifies a major shift in global trade dynamics, allowing China to substantially reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers for this essential commodity and strengthening its geopolitical position.

The article highlights how such intertwined relationships profoundly impact gameplay, particularly for less-connected younger stars like YouTuber Niko Omilana, who faced banishment partly due to being perceived as an "outsider" in the celebrity world.</p>

          <p>A profound mystery surrounds the death of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez, whose severely decomposed body was discovered in the front trunk of pop star D4vd's Tesla, abruptly halting his rising music career. The singer, whose legal name is David Anthony Burke, has yet to comment publicly but is cooperating with authorities, hiring a prominent criminal defense attorney. Rivas Hernandez, a runaway, had a tattoo nearly identical to D4vd's, and reports suggest she was dating a music artist named David, fueling online speculation about their relationship. Weeks later, police have not named a suspect or determined a cause of death, leaving legal experts questioning the slow pace of the investigation into this high-profile and disturbing case.</p>

          <p>Ayish Younis, an 89-year-old Gazan refugee, expresses deep pessimism about Gaza's future reconstruction following the latest two-year war between Israel and Hamas, despite having witnessed his homeland rebuilt before. Forced to flee his Rafah home and now living in a tent, Ayish reflects on his family's repeated displacement since 1948 and the unprecedented scale of current destruction, which he believes cannot be fully repaired. While a ceasefire is in place, Israel retains control of over half the Gaza Strip, including Rafah, leading Ayish to feel that "Gaza has no future." His family, like many Gazans, faces profound uncertainty about rebuilding their lives and finding work in the devastated territory.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and the White House engaged in a heated social media exchange over the temporary closure of Interstate 5 for the U.S. Marine Corps' 250th anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton. Newsom blasted the live-fire demonstration as "dangerous" and a "vanity parade," accusing the Trump administration of endangering the public by firing live munitions over a major freeway. The White House, in turn, accused Newsom of "lying" and disseminating "fake news," asserting that the Marine Corps had not requested the closure and saw no public safety concerns. This public dispute, involving accusations of political manipulation and disregard for safety, highlighted escalating tensions and a profound lack of coordination between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>Betfred's co-founder and chairman, Fred Done, warned that all 1,287 Betfred shops in the UK could close, risking 7,500 jobs, if Chancellor Rachel Reeves increases taxes on gambling firms. Done stated that a tax hike to even 35% or 40% would eliminate profit, forcing widespread closures and potentially pushing gamblers towards unregulated offshore markets. Reeves has indicated a belief that gambling firms should "pay their fair share," with suggestions from a think tank for a 50% tax to raise £3.2 billion for public services. Other major companies like William Hill and Paddy Power have also warned of closures, citing increasing cost pressures and challenging market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an "immediate ceasefire" following crisis talks in Doha, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aimed at establishing mechanisms to ensure lasting peace on their shared border. Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif confirmed the agreement, stating that "terrorism on Pakistani soil conducted from Afghanistan will immediately stop" and both nations would respect each other's sovereignty. This crucial truce follows a week of intense fighting, the deadliest since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, which resulted in dozens of casualties on both sides.

          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to cease using his royal titles and honours, including Duke of York, is a significant symbolic message of displeasure from Buckingham Palace, driven by a desire to end the persistent scandal. This article analyzes that while a deep blow to his pride, it may not substantially alter his daily life, as he remains a prince and continues to reside in a Windsor mansion with a lease until 2078. The move, influenced by King Charles and Prince William, aims to draw a line under the ongoing controversy surrounding his links with Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre. However, the upcoming publication of Giuffre's posthumous memoir ensures continued scrutiny and questions for Andrew and the Palace regarding past dealings.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a U.S. airstrike successfully destroyed a "drug-carrying submarine" in the Caribbean, part of a recent military campaign targeting vessels transporting illegal narcotics, particularly fentanyl, to America.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro confirmed receiving the Colombian detainee, stating he would be processed according to law. This aggressive action comes amidst a significant U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and rising tensions with Venezuela, whose President Nicolas Maduro denies drug smuggling ties and views U.S. strikes as a pretext for regime change.</p>
