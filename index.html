        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has been unsuccessful in its effort to prevent a judicial review of its decision to ban the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. A Court of Appeal ruling allows the challenge, brought by the group's co-founder Huda Ammori, to proceed to the High Court. The ban criminalizes support for the group, leading to over 2,100 arrests since its implementation. This legal development questions the process for proscribing organizations and allows for judicial scrutiny outside the typical, semi-secret appeals commission.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An estimated one billion birds die annually in the United States from colliding with glass windows on buildings, a threat second only to cats and habitat loss. During migration, birds are unable to perceive transparent or reflective glass, leading to fatal impacts. Volunteer groups like Lights Out DC collect data to identify the most dangerous buildings, pushing for bird-friendly designs. Recent initiatives, such as the Bird Collision Prevention Alliance, are promoting solutions like dotted film window treatments, which have proven to dramatically reduce collisions.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 and other global stock markets experienced a significant downturn following warnings from two US regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, about bad or fraudulent loans. This news triggered fears of broader instability within the banking sector, causing shares of major UK banks like Barclays to fall by over 5%. The market anxiety was compounded by recent corporate failures and warnings from JPMorgan Chase's CEO about potential issues in the private credit market, leading investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold.</p>

          <p>In her first interview since UPenn agreed to a Trump administration resolution on women's sports, transgender swimmer Lia Thomas addressed those who believe biological males should not compete in female categories. Thomas argued that it is transphobic to selectively recognize her gender and asserted that hormone replacement therapy mitigates any competitive advantages. The article also references studies suggesting athletic advantages are retained and notes the perspectives of former teammates and competitors, some of whom have filed lawsuits against the NCAA and the university.</p>

          <p>Following a request from his estate, OpenAI has temporarily stopped its AI video generator, Sora, from creating deepfake videos of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The decision came after "disrespectful" content, including altered versions of his speeches and fabricated fights, was generated and shared online. This move highlights the growing controversy over using AI to create hyper-realistic videos of deceased historical figures without consent. While OpenAI has paused images of Dr. King to strengthen its guardrails, critics argue such measures should have been in place from the start.</p>

Greene's criticism of the GOP's handling of the healthcare subsidy debate is framed as her holding to her principles.

          <p>Author Robert Kiyosaki is warning that U.S. baby boomers are facing a severe financial crisis due to inflation, a weak dollar, and the potential insolvency of Social Security. He predicts many will be "wiped out" and left homeless, urging people to prepare for economic turmoil. Kiyosaki advocates for investing in assets that he believes can withstand these pressures, specifically highlighting gold and income-generating real estate. He suggests these tangible assets offer better protection against currency devaluation and market volatility than traditional savings or stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hashem Abedi, who is serving a life sentence for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people, has pleaded not guilty to attempting to murder three prison officers. The alleged attack, which prosecutors say had a terrorist motivation, took place at HMP Frankland in April. Abedi is accused of using makeshift knives and throwing boiling liquid at the officers while shouting "Allahu akbar." He appeared at the Old Bailey via video link and declined legal representation for his upcoming trial.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou is under significant pressure just 38 days after his appointment, having failed to secure a single victory in seven matches. His position is reportedly being reviewed, with the club already exploring potential replacements who favor a more pragmatic style of football. This comes only months after Postecoglou was sacked by Tottenham, despite leading them to a Europa League trophy.

          <p>The BBC has confirmed it will air the upcoming series of Celebrity MasterChef, despite having previously sacked co-host John Torode over an upheld allegation of using an "extremely offensive racist term." The corporation described it as not a "straightforward decision" but stated that all celebrity participants and guests consented to the broadcast. This follows the BBC's decision to also air the amateur version of the show which featured both Torode and his former co-host Gregg Wallace, who was also dismissed following separate allegations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union Court of Justice has ruled that a dog traveling in an airplane's cargo hold legally counts as baggage, limiting an airline's liability if the animal is lost. The decision stems from a case where a passenger's dog, Mona, went missing before an Iberia flight in 2019 and was never found. This ruling means airlines are not required to pay higher compensation for the emotional value of a lost pet, instead capping liability at the lower amount set for checked baggage. The judgment has been criticized by the owner's lawyer as a missed opportunity for advancing animal rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Among large U.S. counties, Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, has seen the most substantial decrease in drug overdose deaths since the national peak in 2023, with a 37% reduction. This success is attributed to a robust and multi-faceted public health strategy that includes advanced drug supply surveillance, rapid-response systems, and widespread community access to naloxone and drug test strips, even in public libraries. By using technology to quickly identify new, dangerous adulterants in the drug supply, the city can issue timely alerts to the public and emergency services, empowering users and improving treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>A 34-fold increase in measles cases across the Americas is being linked by public health experts to low vaccination rates and the spread of misinformation, particularly from the United States. The continent, which had previously eliminated the disease, is now at risk of losing its measles-free status, with over 11,000 cases reported this year. Latin American countries are intensifying vaccination campaigns to combat the highly contagious disease, fearing that imported cases from North America, where outbreaks are at a multi-decade high, pose a significant threat to regional public health.</p>

          <p>Small businesses across the United States are struggling under the financial pressure of President Trump's tariffs, forcing many to take out high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less leverage to negotiate with suppliers or diversify their supply chains, making them more vulnerable to the sudden increase in import duties. Owners report that while they are trying to pass costs to consumers, they are already seeing a decline in sales. Economists warn that the difficulties faced by these businesses could be a leading indicator of broader economic trouble.</p>

          <p>The landscape of cultural criticism is undergoing a profound transformation as traditional media outlets reduce their staff of expert reviewers. In their place, a new class of critics has emerged on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Letterboxd, building personal brands and directly engaging with audiences. While this shift democratizes commentary, these independent creators face new pressures, including algorithmic demands, the need to appease fan cultures, and navigating the blurred lines between editorial content and paid promotion. The article suggests that while the demand for cultural analysis remains high, the profession's future depends on finding sustainable models that support independent, high-quality criticism.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is described by a Georgetown senior fellow as particularly "weird" due to its unique political dynamics. Unlike previous shutdowns over clear, high-stakes policy demands, this one is rooted in a less tangible fear among Democrats about the president's reliability in negotiations, which has been publicly framed around a gettable, but less dramatic, demand for a vote on healthcare subsidies. This, combined with a lack of strong partisan animation and the administration's use of executive actions to mitigate public impact, has created a low-key crisis atmosphere despite the real consequences for federal workers and services.</p>
