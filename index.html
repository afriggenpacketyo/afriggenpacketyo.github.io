        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles over federal immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. The Trump administration deployed the California National Guard in response, prompting California Gov. Gavin Newsom to request the deployment be rescinded, calling it "purposefully inflammatory" and an overreach of federal power. Demonstrators halted traffic, and police deemed the assembly unlawful, highlighting the escalating tensions between state and federal authorities regarding immigration policy and enforcement in California. The deployment has ignited a political battle over state sovereignty and the appropriate use of federal resources during civil unrest. </p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures driven by weak domestic demand and ongoing trade tensions. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, which was slightly better than market expectations. Automotive industry price wars and falling property prices have contributed to the downward pressure on consumer prices. Chinese policymakers have been urged to take action to stimulate domestic consumption and address the deflationary trend, and the government may implement additional monetary easing measures to boost the economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China has begun mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Hongge's team at Beihang University in Beijing. This innovation overcomes limitations in traditional computing by combining binary and stochastic logic. The new chip offers improved fault tolerance and power efficiency for intelligent control applications, including touch displays and flight systems. This development sidesteps some U.S. chip restrictions and addresses the power and architecture challenges faced by current chip technologies.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles, specifically in Paramount, California, following rumors of an immigration raid at a local Home Depot. The unrest was triggered by reports and fears of day laborers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants, being rounded up and arrested. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that there was no actual raid at the Home Depot, dozens of migrants were detained elsewhere in the area. The incident led to violent demonstrations, prompting President Trump to deploy the California National Guard to the city.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in conflict over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles amid ongoing protests. The dispute centers around interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally restricts the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement. Trump deployed the National Guard after attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, while Newsom argues the deployment is unlawful and inflames tensions. The Pentagon has also indicated it is ready to send in active-duty Marines, further escalating the situation and raising questions about the role of the military in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>British energy companies are being paid significant sums to not provide power due to grid limitations and an overreliance on gas. Wind farms, for example, are sometimes paid to reduce output because the grid cannot handle the electricity they generate, while gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity. Balancing the grid in this way has cost the country over Â£500 million this year, potentially reaching Â£8 billion annually by 2030. The government is considering a shift to regional electricity markets to address the issue, but this plan has sparked controversy and may not guarantee cheaper bills for everyone (not investment advice).</p>
