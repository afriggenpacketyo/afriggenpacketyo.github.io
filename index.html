          <p>Toyota is redesigning its all-electric vehicle, previously known as the bZ4X, and renaming it the "bZ" for the 2026 model year to simplify branding and distance itself from the original model's criticisms. The bZ4X received negative reviews and faced a recall due to potential wheel detachment issues. Toyota aims to address these concerns with the updated bZ, promising a 25% increase in EV range, a 50% improvement in horsepower, and enhanced fast-charging capabilities. The redesign reflects Toyota's commitment to improving its EV offerings and addressing past shortcomings.</p>

Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history.

          <p>Despite potential peace talks between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, European countries are preparing a 17th package of sanctions against Russia, according to CNBC. The sanctions target Russia's shadow fleet used for oil transport and individuals/companies supporting the war in Ukraine. Ambassadors from 27 EU member states will meet to discuss the measures, which may be altered. The sanctions are expected to be approved by European foreign affairs ministers next week, although Hungary's stance remains uncertain.

The article emphasizes that the underlying trade relationship remains fragile and subject to re-escalation. The author urges businesses to use this window to fortify short-term plans and accelerate long-term diversification strategies to reduce dependence on China, citing risks of strategic decoupling and potential regulatory entanglements.</p>
