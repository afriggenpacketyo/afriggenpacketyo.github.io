          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with stories about potential changes to the child benefit cap and winter fuel payments for the elderly. *The Observer* reports the government plans to scrap the two-child benefit cap, while *The Sunday Telegraph* says Nigel Farage intends to do the same and reinstate the winter fuel allowance. Several papers also cover the investigation into arson attacks linked to Prime Minister Starmer, with a possible Kremlin connection being probed. Finally, *The Sunday Times* leads with Alan Bates' accusation that the government is running a "quasi kangaroo court" regarding Post Office scandal compensation. </p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in Malibu, California, has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend following its closure due to the Palisades Fire. The fire, which killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres, had isolated the beach city. While progress has been made in clearing debris, remnants of the devastation remain visible along PCH. Some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive outsiders, while business owners are hopeful for a summer recovery after suffering significant losses.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways became the first private operator in the UK to return to public ownership, marking the start of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire rail network by the end of 2027.

The move aims to end 30 years of fragmentation and save compensation fees paid to rail operators. Rail unions support the takeover, citing the failures of privatization.</p>

This trend is changing neighborhoods from being primarily homeowners to renters, with some counties seeing corporate landlords owning over 10% of single-family homes. Concerns are rising that this corporate control could lead to inflated prices, junk fees, and neglected maintenance. Senator Jon Ossoff has launched an investigation into these corporations.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what is claimed to be the world's fastest electromagnetic coilgun. The coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute. The breakthrough involves eliminating capacitors and directly powering the coilgun with lithium batteries. This advancement surpasses previous prototypes and U.S.-made models, potentially redefining future combat.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2. The hit came after Tony Gonsolin, the Dodgers' pitcher, walked two batters to load the bases. David Peterson, the Mets' starter, pitched effectively, while Gonsolin struggled with command. The Dodgers' bullpen, already overworked, was further strained by the loss.</p>

The agency argues that carbon emissions from these plants do not contribute significantly to climate change, a claim disputed by scientists. The proposed regulation is part of a broader effort to uproot policies aimed at curbing climate change, potentially undermining the EPA's legal authority to regulate carbon pollution.
