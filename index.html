          <p>A manhunt is underway for seven inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail by breaching a wall behind a toilet, leading to increased rewards for information. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has called the escape the worst in recent state history and has ordered an audit of the sheriff's office and the Orleans Parish Prison. The escape has drawn intense scrutiny, with concerns raised about delays in discovering the breach and alerting authorities. One of the escapees, Derrick Groves, was arrested for the shooting deaths of two people, causing fear within the victims' family who are now in hiding.</p>

          <p>The UK and the EU are pursuing a stronger relationship through new agreements on fisheries, trade, and security, as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosts EU leaders in London. The agreements aim to reduce bureaucracy and boost the British economy, with eased customs checks on food and plant products expected to significantly benefit the UK. A new defense and security pact is also in the works, potentially allowing the UK defense industry to participate in the EU's defense fund. Starmer views these agreements as a starting point for increased cooperation, though some conservative opponents have criticized the move towards further integration with the EU.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing new regulations to oversee the rapidly growing buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, addressing concerns about potential debt traps for consumers. The proposals require BNPL firms to conduct upfront checks to ensure borrowers can repay their loans and simplify the refund process. Consumers will also have the option to file complaints with the Financial Ombudsman, a service designed to resolve disputes between consumers and financial service providers.

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw centrist candidates halting or slowing down hard-right breakthroughs, though discontent with mainstream parties remains prevalent. In Romania, Nicusor Dan, an independent mayor, defeated George Simion, a Trump-aligned nationalist, confounding expectations of a sharp turn to the right. Poland's election was less decisive, with liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski securing a spot in a runoff against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, indicating a fragmented political landscape and growing support for hard-right candidates. Both elections highlight a move away from established parties and the rise of nationalist sentiments in Eastern Europe.</p>

          <p>China has introduced revised regulations to enforce frugality and reduce waste among party and government bodies, targeting white elephant projects, lavish meals, and excessive use of official vehicles. The new rules, jointly issued by the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council, emphasize diligence and thrift, urging officials to avoid extravagance. Observers have described this round of tightening as the most detailed and stringent since the austerity campaign began 12 years ago. Analysts suggest the move reflects Beijing's growing concern over mounting debts and the need to curb wasteful spending at all levels of government.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer suggested that a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) hiring freeze at the Department of Homeland Security may have contributed to a fatal Brooklyn Bridge crash involving a Mexican navy tall ship.

However, the Coast Guard refuted Schumer's claim, stating that the VTS was fully functional during the incident.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the "NVLink Fusion" program, enabling customers to integrate non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's products and NVLink technology, which was previously exclusive to Nvidia chips. This move aims to allow for the creation of semi-custom AI infrastructure and combine Nvidia processors with various CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). AI chipmaking partners for NVLink Fusion include MediaTek, Marvell, and others. The new technology represents Nvidia's strategy to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, traditionally seen as competitors.</p>

Studies indicate that a significant percentage of consumers plan to cut back on non-essential purchases if their financial situation worsens, with many reducing spending on travel, dining, and entertainment. As prices rise due to trade-related factors, analysts suggest that consumers may not be able to absorb these higher costs, leading to a shift in spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to improve accuracy, polling in 2024 continued to struggle, with polls underestimating Donald Trump's support by a similar margin as in 2016. The article explores the challenges of nonresponse bias and the difficulty of weighting polls to accurately reflect the electorate. Even sophisticated methodologies and high-budget polls failed to deliver accurate results, leading to questions about the reliability of opinion surveys. The trend suggests that the act of participating in polls correlates with specific political affiliations, making it difficult for pollsters to overcome inherent biases.</p>

          <p>The concept of free speech is increasingly challenged, with examples ranging from the pressure on Salman Rushdie to cancel an appearance to NYU's harsh response to a student protest. These incidents, often related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, highlight how difficult it is to uphold free speech when dealing with contentious issues. The Trump administration's actions and characterizations of pro-Palestinian sentiment as anti-Semitism have further complicated the conversation, leading to a culture where people fear expressing themselves outside a narrow range of topics. The author argues that free speech is essential for breaking through categorical thinking and ensuring openness in society.</p>

Without federal expertise, Milwaukee is left to navigate this novel health threat on its own, highlighting a broader trend of the federal government reducing its role in public health emergencies.

          <p>Two security consultants, including one who recently worked for the U.S. State Department, were killed in what appears to have been a cartel ambush at a restaurant in Guadalajara, Mexico. César Guzman, who had been teaching counter-drug classes to Mexican police officers for the State Department, and Carlos Amador, a former security official, were killed in the attack. A third instructor is in critical condition. The violence marks the latest in a series of brazen attacks in Jalisco.</p>
