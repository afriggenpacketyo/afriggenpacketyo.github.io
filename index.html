          <p>Rocket and lunar lander manufacturer Firefly Aerospace experienced a strong market entry, with its stock opening at $70 per share on the Nasdaq, a significant jump from its initial public offering price of $45. This successful debut values the company at nearly $10 billion and reflects growing investor interest in the space technology sector. The company has secured major contracts with entities like NASA and Northrop Grumman, and despite reporting a net loss, its revenue has seen a sixfold increase, signaling strong growth potential in a resurgent tech IPO market.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have fallen to their lowest average since May, reaching 8.13%, making them one of the most affordable borrowing options available. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates soon, the variable rates on HELOCs are likely to decrease further, presenting a timely opportunity for homeowners. Compared to more expensive alternatives like fixed-rate home equity loans, personal loans, or credit cards with near-record high interest rates, a HELOC currently offers a more financially advantageous way for homeowners to access funds.

          <p>Peloton reported an unexpected profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, causing its shares to rise, while also announcing plans to lay off 6% of its staff to further reduce expenses. Under new CEO Peter Stern, the company is implementing a cost-restructuring plan to save an additional $100 million, aiming to improve long-term financial health despite the impact on employees. The positive earnings were driven by better-than-expected sales and significant cuts in operating costs, including marketing and R&D.

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants, a move that would have significant repercussions on congressional representation and federal funding. The U.S. Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons, and the Supreme Court previously blocked the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question in 2020. This new effort faces a long and complex process, as planning for the 2030 census is already underway and any changes would likely face legal challenges, especially given concerns about undercounting minority populations.</p>

Having started the season ranked 333rd in the world, her remarkable run has seen her defeat top players, setting up a final against Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka. Mboko, whose parents sought refuge in the U.S. from the Democratic Republic of Congo, credits her success to a fearless mentality and inspiration from watching the Williams sisters. Her performance is being hailed as a sign of a major new talent emerging in women's tennis.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has started detaining dozens of migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new pilot deportation agreement with France. Under the "one in, one out" scheme, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one approved asylum seeker from France via a safe and legal route. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the first returns could happen within weeks and that the government will robustly defend against legal challenges. The 11-month pilot program is a key part of the Labour government's strategy to secure the nation's borders and deter illegal crossings.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast, slightly lowering its storm prediction but still anticipating above-normal activity. The new outlook projects 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine becoming hurricanes and two to five of those strengthening into major hurricanes. Factors contributing to the active season include warmer-than-average ocean temperatures and a neutral El Niño phase, which reduces wind shear that typically suppresses storm formation.

          <p>The president of the United Arab Emirates met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, reinforcing the deepening strategic and economic partnership between the two nations. The leaders pledged to double their bilateral trade, which has already surged to $11.5 billion since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The UAE, a key U.S. ally, has maintained a neutral stance on the war and has not participated in Western sanctions, becoming an important economic haven for Russia. This growing relationship tests the limits of U.S. influence, as Washington has previously expressed concern over the UAE facilitating trade that could aid Russia's war effort.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Indian-administered Kashmir region have banned 25 books and conducted raids on bookstores, accusing the authors of promoting secessionist ideology and misleading youth. The banned list includes works by prominent academics and Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The move, which occurred on the anniversary of India revoking the region's special status, has been condemned by separatist leaders as authoritarian and an attempt to erase historical facts. This action follows similar raids earlier in the year where police seized Islamic literature, escalating tensions in the disputed Muslim-majority territory.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's stock dropped significantly after its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, showed more modest weight-loss results than investors had anticipated in a late-stage trial. The highest dose of the pill helped patients lose nearly 12% of their body weight, a figure below the 15% that some Wall Street analysts had hoped for. While the results are still clinically meaningful and pave the way for a new needle-free option, the data disappointed investors hoping for a clear win over rival Novo Nordisk. The company still plans to seek regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller becoming the next Fed chair has surged on prediction markets, crossing 50% on Kalshi for the first time. This spike followed reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's data-driven approach to monetary policy. Waller, a Trump appointee who recently dissented on a decision to hold rates, is now seen as a leading candidate over previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett. His perceived dovish stance and political independence have made him a favorable choice for investors watching the future of U.S. monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, President Trump has fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Erika McEntarfer, after claiming a recent jobs report was a "scam" designed to make him look bad. This article draws a historical parallel to Richard Nixon, who in 1971 privately raged against a BLS official and suspected a conspiracy but stopped short of firing the commissioner. The author argues that while Nixon's motives were sinister, his actions were constrained by political norms of his era. In contrast, Trump's public dismissal of the nonpartisan official demonstrates a more dangerous and unconstrained abuse of presidential authority.</p>

This development occurred after some of the Democrats, who are protesting in Illinois, were forced to evacuate their hotel due to a bomb threat. The lawmakers left Texas to break quorum and prevent a vote on a Republican-led proposal that could create five more GOP-leaning congressional seats. The Democrats accuse the state's Republican leadership of trying to silence their dissent through intimidation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. This move could open the door for trillions of dollars in retirement savings to flow into these traditionally excluded markets, marking a significant victory for the alternative asset industry. While proponents argue this provides more investment options, it also introduces new risks for retirement savers due to the higher fees, lower transparency, and longer lockup periods associated with these assets.

          <p>Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren are demanding internal documents from UnitedHealth Group regarding a program that provides financial bonuses to nursing homes for reducing hospital transfers. This request follows an investigation by The Guardian which, based on whistleblower accounts and internal records, suggested the healthcare giant may be prioritizing profits over the health of elderly residents. The senators expressed concern that the bonus structure, which caps hospitalizations for any reason, could incentivize withholding critical care. UnitedHealth denies any wrongdoing, stating the program improves care by preventing unnecessary and dangerous hospitalizations.</p>
