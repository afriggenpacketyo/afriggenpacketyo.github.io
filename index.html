          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported a productive phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, focusing on sanctions against Russia, ongoing military strikes, and a significant drone production agreement. Zelenskyy noted that Trump is fully informed about Russia's attacks and has set a deadline for Moscow to make peace or face more severe sanctions. The conversation also highlighted a pending U.S.-Ukraine deal to bolster Kyiv's domestic defense industry through foreign investment in drone manufacturing. Trump separately suggested that falling global energy prices could pressure Russia's economy and compel President Putin to end the conflict, a strategy that includes pressuring nations like India to reduce their purchases of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have arrested Austin Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect accused of murdering four of his relatives. The investigation began after an infant was found abandoned in a yard, which led police to discover the bodies of the victims: Cortney Rose, Adrianna Williams, Braydon Williams, and James Matthew Wilson. The victims include a mother, her two children, and her daughter's partner. Drummond, who was reportedly dating a close relative of the victims, now faces four counts of first-degree murder. The case has left a young child orphaned, having lost parents, a grandparent, and an uncle in the tragic event.</p>

          <h2>An Examination of Reverse Mortgages and the Possibility of Outliving Their Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 13:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Americans live longer, many retirees are considering reverse mortgages as a way to convert home equity into cash flow without monthly loan payments. This article explores the mechanics of these financial products, addressing the common concern of whether a homeowner can outlive their reverse mortgage. While the loan does not expire as long as the owner resides in the home and meets obligations like paying taxes, it is possible to exhaust the home's equity over time. The loan balance, which includes accrued interest, can eventually exceed the property's value, leaving little for heirs. The structure of the payout, such as a line of credit versus a lump sum, significantly impacts how long the funds last. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, compelling them to provide testimony related to the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein. The committee, led by Republican Chairman James Comer, also subpoenaed several former attorneys general and FBI directors from the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. This move follows a bipartisan push for more transparency after the Justice Department announced it would not release further details from its Epstein files. The subpoenas aim to gather more information on Epstein's network and his relationships with powerful figures, with deposition dates set for October.

          <p>NASA's acting administrator has directed the agency to accelerate its plans to deploy a small nuclear reactor on the moon, aiming for a launch by late 2029. The directive positions the U.S. in a strategic race against China and Russia, who have announced a joint plan to establish a lunar reactor by the mid-2030s. The U.S. fears that the first nation to deploy such a power source could establish a prohibitive presence, hindering future American lunar missions like the Artemis program. The proposed reactor would utilize microreactor technology to generate at least 100 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power a small lunar base and support long-term exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, total U.S. credit card debt rose by $27 billion in the second quarter of 2025, reaching a collective $1.21 trillion. This figure matches the all-time high set last year and reflects a 2.3% increase from the previous quarter. Alongside the rising balances, the report highlights elevated delinquency rates, with 6.93% of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past year. Researchers suggest this trend is partly due to consumers overextending themselves as inflation increased living costs after pandemic-era savings were depleted. Subprime borrowers, particularly younger consumers, are showing the most significant signs of financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.

The report indicates that job creation in sectors like leisure, hospitality, and government has weakened. However, the healthcare and social assistance sector remains a powerful engine of growth, accounting for nearly half of all employment growth over the past year.

          <p>Roku is shifting its strategy by launching 'Howdy,' a new ad-free streaming service priced at $2.99 per month. This marks a departure for the company, which has primarily been known for its free, ad-supported Roku Channel. The new service will feature 10,000 hours of content from major studios like Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, in addition to Roku's own original programming. Roku's CEO stated that Howdy is designed to complement premium services rather than compete with them directly. The move comes as ad-supported streaming services have seen significant growth, and it allows Roku to tap into the subscription-based market while maintaining its popular free offering.</p>

Revenues for the period rose 33% year-over-year to $668.5 million, and adjusted earnings per share were well ahead of estimates. The strong performance was driven by growth across all segments, reflecting increased security needs and the success of new products, which accounted for over 30% of recent bookings.

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the first freely elected president of Romania who led the country's turbulent transition from communism to democracy, has died at the age of 95. Iliescu served two terms as president and was a dominant figure in Romanian politics for years after the 1989 revolution. However, his legacy is deeply controversial, as he was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the violent revolt that overthrew the communist regime and for calling in miners to brutally suppress student protests in 1990. Although he faced charges, he was never convicted. The Romanian government announced his passing and stated that details for a state funeral would follow.</p>

          <p>High-rated U.S. corporations are increasingly financing their mergers and acquisitions with equity and cash rather than taking on new debt. This shift in strategy is attributed to high borrowing costs and concerns about potential credit rating downgrades associated with increased leverage. With stock valuations high and corporate cash flows healthy, using equity has become a more attractive option. This trend is evident in major deals like Union Pacific's planned acquisition of Norfolk Southern, which is expected to be funded mostly with stock. This reliance on equity over debt could lead to lower-than-expected issuance volumes in the investment-grade bond market for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump suggested the banks discriminated against him and other conservatives due to pressure from regulators during the Biden administration. The claims come as the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to prevent banks from dropping clients for political reasons.

For its first project, Redwood has partnered with AI infrastructure firm Crusoe to build a microgrid that uses repurposed batteries to provide 24/7 renewable power from a solar array. This innovative solution addresses the skyrocketing energy demand of the AI boom while creating a sustainable, closed-loop system for battery recycling and reuse, offering a cost-effective alternative to new energy storage systems.</p>

          <p>Following a significant downward revision to recent U.S. jobs numbers, which prompted political controversy, experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a normal part of the data collection process. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) initially releases preliminary estimates based on incomplete survey responses to provide timely information. These figures are then revised in subsequent months as more complete payroll data becomes available from businesses. Former BLS officials emphasize that these revisions are a standard feature, not a flaw, designed to improve accuracy over time. The recent large revision was attributed to late reporting from state and local governments, reflecting the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>
