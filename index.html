          <p>AppLovin experienced a significant increase in share value after exceeding earnings and revenue projections and declaring the sale of its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash, acquiring a 20% stake in Tripledot. The advertising tech company's first-quarter net income rose to $576 million, a substantial increase from the previous year, driven by strong advertising sales. However, AppLovin anticipates lower second-quarter advertising sales compared to analyst expectations, influencing investor sentiment. The company's total costs and expenses also saw a 14% increase compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting ongoing investments in its core advertising technology business.</p>

          <p>Cameron Hamilton was removed from his position as acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after publicly disagreeing with President Trump's plans to eliminate the agency. This decision followed Hamilton's testimony before Congress where he emphasized FEMA's crucial role in assisting communities during disasters, contrasting with Trump's expressed desire to dismantle the agency. David Richardson has been appointed as the new acting administrator, amidst ongoing debates about FEMA's future and its role in disaster response and management. This leadership change occurs as FEMA faces challenges including staff downsizing and increasing demands due to climate change-related disasters.</p>

          <p>As Russia prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, the state is increasingly using Victory Day to reinforce its ideology, according to analysts. Parades and displays involving children in military attire are being organized to instill a sense of national unity and historical connection. Political scientist Alexey Yusupov notes that the Kremlin is using this anniversary to draw parallels between the Soviet Union and modern Russia, aiming to legitimize the current regime. Despite the Kremlin's efforts, many Russians still associate May 9 with mourning the losses of World War II, rather than militaristic displays, though some feel the military parade is superfluous given Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.</p>

Senator Thom Tillis cited Martin's stance on January 6th as the reason he could not support the nomination, emphasizing the importance of condemning the events of that day.

          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her attempt to have her appeal of a 2022 fraud conviction reheard by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The court denied her request for a rehearing before the original three-judge panel, and no judge on the circuit court requested a vote on whether to have the full court rehear the appeal. This decision leaves the Supreme Court as Holmes's last option to overturn her conviction, which stemmed from deceiving investors about the capabilities of her blood-testing company, Theranos. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison in January 2023.</p>

Economists predict that inflation will rise significantly in the coming months as a result of tariffs, although the impact could be mitigated if the U.S. forges new trade deals.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced that it will discontinue tracking the costs of billion-dollar disasters, leaving researchers, insurers, and policymakers without key data. This decision has been criticized by researchers and lawmakers, who argue that the database is crucial for understanding the economic consequences of extreme weather events. The move comes amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to limit climate research, including budget cuts and the dismissal of authors working on climate assessments. Critics argue that without this data, the U.S. government will be unable to make informed decisions about infrastructure investments and disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a "fool" and accusing him of being "too late" after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady. Trump believes that lowering interest rates would provide a boost to the markets, similar to actions taken by other countries. The Fed, however, stated that it is waiting for a clearer economic outlook before making any changes, citing risks of higher unemployment and inflation. Powell maintained that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and not influenced by political pressure.</p>
