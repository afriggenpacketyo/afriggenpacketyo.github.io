          <p>Daimler Truck has announced a significant cost-cutting program, intending to eliminate approximately 5,000 jobs in Germany by 2030. The move follows a reported 5% drop in second-quarter sales and is part of a strategy to improve profitability and make its European business more resilient. The company aims to achieve over €1 billion in annual savings through personnel reduction, primarily via attrition and early retirement, as well as cuts to other operational expenses. The workforce reduction will be socially responsible, with an agreement in place to avoid compulsory redundancies until the end of 2034.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is set to end its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at many U.S. airports. According to a memo, the change aims to expedite the security process, allowing all travelers, not just those in PreCheck, to keep their shoes on. This marks a significant shift from the rule implemented in 2006 after Richard Reid's attempted shoe-bombing. Passengers who trigger alarms at scanners will still be required to remove their footwear for additional screening as the new policy rolls out nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish police have indicated that evidence suggests Portuguese footballer Diogo Jota was driving and likely exceeding the speed limit when his Lamborghini crashed, killing him and his brother. The accident occurred on a motorway in Zamora province when the car reportedly had a tire blowout, left the road, and caught fire. An expert report is being prepared for the courts, with the investigation complicated by the severe fire damage to the vehicle. The crash happened just days after the 28-year-old Liverpool player's wedding, as he was traveling to return to pre-season training.</p>

          <h2>Forensic Psychologist Warns Idaho Killer's Plea Deal May Be a Calculated 'Long Game'</h2>

          <p>A forensic psychologist has raised concerns about the plea deal for Bryan Kohberger, who admitted to murdering four University of Idaho students. Dr. Kris Mohandie suggests that by avoiding the death penalty, Kohberger is "playing the long game," as future changes in law could potentially allow for appeals or sentence reductions, despite his forfeiture of those rights in the deal. The expert draws parallels to cases like the Menendez brothers, whose life sentences were recently reduced, warning that time can soften public opinion and lead to unforeseen outcomes. This perspective highlights the debate over the plea deal's long-term finality.</p>

          <p>Three men have been found guilty of an aggravated arson attack on a London warehouse that was shipping aid to Ukraine, an act carried out on behalf of the Russian Wagner Group. The attack, which caused around £1 million in damage, was part of a series of "missions" orchestrated by another individual who had already pleaded guilty. The warehouse was targeted for its role in sending humanitarian supplies and Starlink satellite equipment to Ukraine. This case is a prominent example of a state-linked organization using local "proxies" to conduct serious criminal activity in the UK.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to the deaths of at least 104 people, with dozens still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and a girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, which suffered numerous fatalities. A major disaster has been declared, and massive search and rescue operations are ongoing, involving hundreds of personnel and aircraft. Meteorologists attribute the extreme event to a convergence of storms with tropical moisture over a drought-stricken area, which exacerbated the runoff.

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and loyal cabinet minister during Margaret Thatcher's government, has passed away at the age of 94. Known as a key architect of "Thatcherism," he was instrumental in implementing laws to curb trade union power during his time as employment secretary. He was also praised for his courage and resilience after he and his wife were severely injured in the 1984 IRA bombing in Brighton. Political figures from across the spectrum, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and former Prime Minister David Cameron, have paid tribute to his significant, though sometimes abrasive, impact on British politics.</p>

          <p>While increased U.S. tariff pressure on Japan and South Korea is unlikely to cause them to abandon their alliance with Washington, some experts believe it could create an opening for China. The trade tensions might incentivize Beijing to offer enhanced economic cooperation to Tokyo and Seoul. An international relations professor at Nanjing University noted that the pragmatic, less ideological leadership in Japan and Korea could lead them to pursue more stable ties with China. This situation presents a complex diplomatic dynamic where economic pressures could subtly shift regional alignments without fundamentally altering security partnerships.</p>

Osborn, a union leader and Navy veteran, is framing the campaign as a fight between the working class and the "billionaire class" represented by Ricketts. In his previous bid against Senator Deb Fischer, Osborn significantly outperformed expectations in the solidly red state. His campaign is expected to again focus on a populist message, including affordability, border security, and moderate stances on issues like abortion and gun safety.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is facing criticism for issuing an unexplained order that lifted an injunction, thereby allowing the Trump administration to deport asylum-seekers to third countries without a hearing. This article argues that the lack of any written reasoning threatens the rule of law by replacing legal interpretation with mere pronouncement. The case involved individuals who feared torture in South Sudan, and the Court's order was issued despite the administration's prior defiance of a lower court's ruling. Justice Sotomayor's dissent warned that rewarding such noncompliance erodes respect for the judiciary and legal processes.</p>

On the highway, the electric motor's role is reduced, but the system still enhances efficiency compared to gas-only cars. The piece explains that steady-state driving is less demanding on a hybrid's battery than the constant charge-discharge cycle of urban traffic.

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that Meta's Instagram platform was running paid advertisements that promoted escort services and sex work, linking to channels on the messaging app Telegram. These ads, some from accounts with large followings, violated Meta's policies against human exploitation and adult sexual solicitation. In response to the findings, Meta removed the associated accounts, disabled the ad accounts, and banned the administrators from its platforms. The incident highlights ongoing challenges for Meta in combating the rise of sexualized paid advertisements and enforcing its own content moderation rules effectively.</p>

While the bloc has expanded to include new members and partners, representing a significant portion of the global population and economy, its efforts to create a true alternative to the dollar have been hampered by internal divisions, particularly between China and India.</p>

          <p>Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, are experiencing a significant rise in volunteer applications, with numbers up by about 20% this year. Officials attribute this trend partly to the war in Ukraine, which has motivated more young people to serve. This growth is crucial as the Bundeswehr aims to expand its ranks to meet increased NATO commitments in response to the threat from Russia. To further boost recruitment, the defense minister plans to make military service more attractive and will soon require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their fitness and willingness to serve.</p>

The outlook is further dampened by logistical changes, with the planned two-day summit being shortened to one at Beijing's request.

          <p>This article argues that the demise of fast fashion has been greatly exaggerated, despite U.S. tariffs impacting sales for companies like Shein and Temu. The industry is proving to be nimble, with brands shifting production to other regions to avoid tariffs and finding new markets in Europe and Latin America. The piece contends that fast fashion's core problems—exploitative labor and environmental harm—are not unique to specific companies or countries but are widespread across the entire clothing industry. It suggests that individual consumer choices are insufficient and that structural changes and stronger regulations are needed for meaningful reform.</p>

          <p>A recent survey suggests many Americans are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their finances based on feelings about the economy, which is fueling a trend of "revenge saving." This shift from post-pandemic splurging to saving is driven by anxiety over inflation and a potential recession. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial habits and instead recommend intentional strategies. They suggest taking a 'money temperature' to assess your situation, using 'reverse budgeting' to prioritize savings, and creating separate, automated accounts for different goals to build a strong financial foundation.
