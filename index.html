          <p>Two Milwaukee police officers were shot and critically injured while responding to a call about an armed individual. Authorities described the incident as an ambush, stating the officers were fired upon as they approached an alley. A city-wide search is underway for at least one suspect, with the mayor and police officials urging the perpetrator to surrender. The Milwaukee Police Association released a statement decrying the event as a reflection of escalating violence in the city, noting it marks a breaking point for the community and its law enforcement.</p>

          <p>United Kingdom car production plummeted to its lowest level for the month of May since 1949, excluding the pandemic lockdown period. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), output fell by nearly a third as exports to the United States were halved due to new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The tariffs prompted major manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover to halt shipments. However, the SMMT expressed some optimism, as a new deal set to reduce the US import tax from 25% to 10% on many UK cars is expected to take effect soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO is strengthening its ties with the commercial space industry as part of a new strategy that recognizes space as a critical operational domain. The alliance has also agreed to a new target for members to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP by 2035, a significant jump from the previous 2% goal. This financial commitment is expected to drive investment in space-based capabilities for communication, navigation, and surveillance, benefiting both established defense contractors and newer satellite imagery providers.

The 75-year-old style icon will not be retiring, however, as she will retain senior roles at parent company CondÃ© Nast, including her position as Vogue's global editorial director. Wintour's tenure has been credited with shaping global fashion and transforming the Met Gala into a major celebrity event.

          <p>International efforts to hold Russia's leadership accountable for the war in Ukraine are intensifying with the establishment of a new special tribunal. Created through an agreement between the Council of Europe and the Ukrainian government, this court will focus specifically on the "crime of aggression," aiming to prosecute high-ranking officials like Vladimir Putin for the decision to wage war. This initiative complements ongoing actions by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued arrest warrants for Russian officials over alleged war crimes. These legal maneuvers aim to close a loophole, as the ICC cannot currently prosecute the crime of aggression against non-ratifying states like Russia.</p>

Investor sentiment was also bolstered by an apparent de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

          <p>A national security expert is warning that "agroterrorism" from foreign adversaries could pose a significant threat to the United States' food supply and national survival. The concern follows the recent arrest of two Chinese nationals accused of smuggling a crop-killing fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the country. Kristofor Healey, a former Department of Homeland Security official, explained that such biological agents are designed to attack key agricultural products like wheat and barley. He argues that this form of terrorism, which targets a nation's civilian population through its food infrastructure, represents a critical and often overlooked vulnerability for the U.S.</p>

Immigrants now constitute a record high of nearly one-fifth of the US workforce, and business owners in sectors like cleaning, caregiving, and construction report that they are already struggling to find staff.

Over the first five months of 2025, cumulative profits were down 1.1%, with the mining and automotive manufacturing sectors experiencing significant drops.

Middleton-Patel, who was diagnosed at 18, hopes that by speaking openly, she can foster greater understanding of neurodivergence in sports and beyond.

          <p>One year after a landslide election victory, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is facing significant challenges, moving from a sunny political honeymoon to a period of crisis. The new Labour government, largely inexperienced after 14 years in opposition, has struggled to define a clear direction, often opting for reviews over decisive action. Early missteps, such as a quickly reversed cut to the winter fuel payment, and a major backbench rebellion over welfare reforms have damaged the prime minister's authority. While Starmer has earned praise for his pragmatic approach on the world stage, his government is now battling to prove it can deliver on domestic priorities and regain momentum.</p>

          <p>The UK government has made a significant U-turn on its planned welfare reforms following a large-scale rebellion from its own Labour MPs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was forced to capitulate after facing overwhelming opposition to the cuts, which would have impacted disability benefits. The reversal is seen as a major blow to the authority of a government that is less than a year old and holds a large parliamentary majority. This event marks the third major policy reversal, raising questions about the government's grip on its agenda and its ability to manage the public finances, a core element of its political image.</p>

          <p>The Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) has elected Seiko Hashimoto, a former Olympic speed skater and cyclist, as its new president. The 60-year-old lawmaker becomes the first woman to lead the national governing body for sports in Japan. Her election is a significant milestone for the organization. However, the appointment is likely to face some scrutiny due to her connection to a political funds scandal that has recently impacted the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, of which she is a member. Hashimoto's leadership will be crucial as Japan prepares for future Olympic games and navigates the country's complex political landscape.</p>

          <p>Japan's job availability ratio fell slightly in May to 1.24, marking the first decline in three months. The data, released by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, indicates there were 124 available jobs for every 100 job seekers. This slight decrease is attributed to an increase in the number of workers seeking new employment, likely driven by a desire for better working conditions and higher wages amidst persistent inflation. The figures provide a snapshot of the current labor market dynamics as the country navigates ongoing economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 50th anniversary of the German-Brazilian nuclear agreement is being marked amid renewed debate over its future.

Critics, including Germany's Green Party, have long called for its termination, citing safety concerns and its outdated nature. The agreement has become more contentious due to Russia's involvement in the uranium supply chain, prompting calls to replace the nuclear pact with a partnership focused on renewable energies.</p>

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted of murdering nine people he had contacted through social media. Shiraishi, dubbed the "Twitter killer," was found guilty of killing, dismembering, and storing the bodies of his victims, who had expressed suicidal thoughts online. The execution, ordered by the Justice Minister, occurs amidst ongoing debate in Japan over capital punishment, particularly following the recent acquittal of a man who spent over four decades on death row. Public support for the death penalty in Japan remains high despite international criticism from human rights groups.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman is facing mounting criticism from within his own Democratic party over his perceived willingness to cooperate with President Donald Trump and his stance on key issues. Frustration that began with his staunch support for Israel's war in Gaza has now expanded to his positions on domestic policy and his criticism of fellow Democrats. In response, former primary opponent Conor Lamb has reemerged as a prominent voice, holding town halls across the state and articulating the dissatisfaction of many progressives. This internal conflict highlights a broader struggle for Democrats in a crucial swing state as they navigate their relationship with the new administration.</p>
