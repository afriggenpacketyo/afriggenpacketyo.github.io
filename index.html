          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, resulted in two deaths and over 30 injuries.  The attack targeted a military hospital, shopping center, and apartment buildings.

He stated that higher prices would encourage consumers to buy American-made cars.

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance's unwelcomed trip to Greenland sparked criticism and calls for his resignation.  The visit, seen as an attempt to further Trump's annexation plans, was met with hostility from Greenlandic and Danish officials. The Guardian article strongly criticizes Vance's actions and calls for his resignation. The strongly worded criticism and calls for resignation might be perceived as a biased perspective, potentially overlooking any potential justifications or mitigating factors related to Vance's actions.</p>
