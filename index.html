            <p>Westchester County Police responded to a call about a llama on the loose, only to discover it was an alpaca that had escaped from a trailer near Hotel MTK. Officers Mirko and Rodriguez successfully wrangled the alpaca, which had wandered to Kisco Avenue near a Land Rover dealership, prompting a joke about the animal seeking an upgrade. The alpaca was safely returned to its owner, leading police to speculate it was destined for a child's birthday party. Alpacas, native to the Andes Mountains, are commonly used in petting zoos and children's events.</p>

            <p>Ukraine reported a series of Russian drone attacks across several regions just hours after the expiration of a 30-hour Easter truce declared by Moscow. Air raid alerts were issued for the Kyiv region and other areas, with explosions reported in Mykolaiv. Both sides had accused each other of violating the ceasefire, and Russia has not commented on the renewed attacks. This escalation follows a period of relative calm during the declared truce, raising concerns about the ongoing conflict and the potential for further violence.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against yielding to U.S. pressure in trade negotiations amid rising tariff disputes initiated by the Trump administration. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that appeasement would not lead to peace and urged countries to defend international trade rules and the multilateral trading system. This warning comes after reports that the U.S. plans to leverage tariff negotiations to push countries into imposing trade barriers on China. The U.S. has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China, and other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.</p>

            <p>Paul Taylor argues that despite the challenges posed by Donald Trump's policies, including tariffs and skepticism towards NATO, European leaders have an opportunity to strengthen integration. He suggests completing the European capital markets and banking union, striking trade deals, developing common defense capabilities, and providing greater military assistance to Ukraine. Taylor believes that Europe can leverage this situation to become a more reliable partner and a stronger global force, even while maintaining a transatlantic economic partnership. He also highlights the potential for new leadership in Germany to drive these changes.</p>

            <p>Following reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used a second Signal chat to discuss last month's airstrikes in Yemen with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, Democratic senators have called for his resignation. Senator Tammy Duckworth called for him to “resign in disgrace,” while Senator Jack Reed expressed “grave concerns” about Hegseth’s ability to maintain trust and confidence.

            <p>Alessandro Paredes, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant, spoke to ABC News from a detention center in Texas after his deportation was temporarily blocked by a Supreme Court order. Paredes claimed he and others were "forced to sign a paper" saying they are part of a gang, and expressed fear of being deported to El Salvador. The White House defended the administration's actions, stating they are using all lawful measures to remove the threat of terrorist illegal aliens. The ACLU has argued that the Venezuelan migrants have not had adequate notice or time to challenge their removals.</p>

            <p>This article critiques the second season of HBO's 'The Last of Us', noting that while the show previously expanded on the game's storytelling effectively, Season 2's plot detours feel awkwardly inserted, particularly the extended sequence depicting Joel's death. The adaptation's shift towards undiluted pain and unrelenting cheerlessness is criticized, as the show's limited imagination prevents it from delving into Ellie's emotional journey. The article suggests that by leaning too far into its characters' anguish, the storytelling has become more circular and suffocating.</p>

Trump recently raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, leading China to impose a 125% tariff on US goods.
