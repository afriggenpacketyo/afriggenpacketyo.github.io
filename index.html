          <p>President Trump's U.K. state visit included a news conference with Prime Minister Keir Starmer after signing a tech investment deal. The leaders engaged in trade and geopolitical discussions at Chequers, Starmer's official country residence. Commitments from the U.S.-U.K. trade deal were finalized, alongside discussions on tariffs and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The U.K. government has hailed £150 billion in inward investment during the visit, expected to boost jobs and growth across the country. The two leaders appear to have a strong relationship, despite their different political backgrounds, which has been key to the visit's success. </p>

          <p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticized Jimmy Kimmel for allegedly misleading the public about the motive behind Charlie Kirk's killing. Carr stated that Kimmel's comments, linking the alleged killer to President Trump's movement, were not a joke but a direct attempt to mislead the public. Court documents indicate the killer expressed anti-Kirk sentiments due to perceived hate speech, leaning left politically and supporting gay and trans rights. ABC suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely following the controversy, which arose from Kimmel's opening monologue on Monday's show. The incident has sparked debate about the role of late-night hosts in political discourse and the responsibility of verifying information. </p>

          <p>Uber Technologies is partnering with Flytrex to launch a drone delivery service for Uber Eats customers in select U.S. pilot markets by the end of the year. Uber aims to create a flexible, multimodal delivery network beyond cars, bikes, and couriers. Flytrex drones have already completed over 200,000 deliveries in suburban areas and is one of the few companies authorized for "Beyond Visual Line of Sight" operations. This announcement comes after Uber's recent unveiling of helicopter booking options, marking advancements in the company's offerings. Other companies, including DoorDash, are also exploring drone delivery as the technology becomes more mainstream. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spirit Airlines plans to cut its capacity by approximately 25% starting in November as part of a restructuring effort after filing for bankruptcy for the second time in a year. CEO Dave Davis indicated that layoffs are likely as the airline aims to reduce costs and become more efficient. The airline will also discontinue service in a dozen U.S. cities starting in October, as discount carriers struggle to compete with larger airlines. Southwest, another low-cost carrier, has started selling tickets with assigned seats for an added cost, reflecting shifting customer preferences for premium flight experiences. Spirit operates roughly 5,000 flights to 88 destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama, and Colombia. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of thousands of workers across France participated in strike action protesting budget cuts proposed by the previous government. Public transport was heavily disrupted, with metro lines shut down in Paris, and students blocked entrances to schools and universities. Unions are demanding increased spending on public services and higher taxes on the wealthy, while calling for the current budget cuts to be scrapped.

The new prime minister faces a hung parliament and the challenge of crafting a budget that is palatable to a majority of MPs. </p>

          <p>The Bank of England has maintained UK interest rates at 4%, cautioning that the country is "not out of the woods yet" regarding rising inflation. Despite expectations of a hold, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to cut rates to 3.75%. The Bank expects inflation to return to its 2% target but remains cautious about future rate cuts, emphasizing that any further reductions will depend on evidence of easing price pressures. The Bank also announced a slower pace for reducing its holdings of government debt, weeks after financial market turmoil. The Bank's regional offices reported that business sentiment is downbeat, with firms citing the upcoming autumn Budget as a source of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Texas Abortion Pill Providers Refuse to Comply with New Law</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Abortion pill providers targeted by a new Texas law that allows people to sue anyone suspected of manufacturing, distributing, or mailing abortion pills to or from Texas, are refusing to comply. The law, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, is set to dramatically escalate the state-by-state battle over abortion access. Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, stated that her organization will continue providing care until legally unable to do so in Massachusetts. The law imposes penalties of at least $100,000 on providers who mail pills into the state, which bans virtually all abortions. Some providers are relying on “shield laws” in other states to protect themselves from prosecution. </p>

          <p>NBA star Kevin Durant can't access his Coinbase bitcoin account due to a forgotten password, but his agent is pleased with the situation. The agent said that Durant's inability to sell the bitcoin has "only benefited" him, as its value has significantly increased. Durant began investing in bitcoin around 2016, after hearing about it from his teammates. Bitcoin's value has risen dramatically since then, trading at almost $116,000, compared to between $360 and $1,000 in 2016. Durant and his agent are also investors in Coinbase Global, and the company is assisting with account recovery. </p>

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper warned that the Federal Reserve risks creating inflation and asset bubbles if it cuts interest rates too much. While acknowledging the Fed could cut rates a bit more, Tepper cautioned against excessive easing. He suggested that the Fed should remain slightly restrictive to avoid a weaker dollar and increased inflation. Tepper noted that valuations are high but wouldn't bet against stocks while the Fed is still in easing mode. He expressed concerns about the levels of valuation in the market, stating that "nothing's cheap anymore." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Atlantic criticizes the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, arguing it represents an attempt to control speech and suppress dissent. The article asserts that the Trump administration is using Kirk's death as a pretext to censor its opposition. It highlights the speed at which American corporations surrendered their First Amendment rights in response to Trump's displeasure. The piece warns that this is a step towards totalitarianism, threatening fundamental freedoms and the right to express oneself. The author says the Trump administration does not subscribe to the theory that the Constitution protects speech opposed by people in power. </p>

          <p>A report details the Los Angeles Clippers' and Steve Ballmer's financial connections to Aspiration, the company that allegedly paid Kawhi Leonard $28 million for "no-show jobs." The report highlights the timing of payments from the Clippers and Ballmer to Aspiration, often coinciding with Leonard's contract or payment deadlines. It also explores the role of carbon credits, suggesting they may have been used to generate profit for Aspiration to pay Leonard. The NBA has reopened its investigation into whether Leonard received impermissible benefits during his free-agent pursuit. The report uncovers suspicious actions, but there's no smoking gun directly confirming that the team or Ballmer paid Aspiration to circumvent the salary cap. </p>

          <p>Liverpool has been scoring late winners in all five of their competitive matches this season, averaging a match-winning moment after 91 minutes. This run of late goals is a marked difference from last season, when they only scored four stoppage-time goals in 48 matches. Manager Arne Slot attributes this success to self-belief and fitness, emphasizing the team's mentality to always push. Despite the squad's average age, older players have been heavily involved in the late-goal involvements. The team's success is attributed to both the manager's strategy and the experience of the players on the pitch. </p>

          <p>The article analyzes the shift in the US media landscape towards Trump's MAGA ideology, noting a rightward trend in the entertainment business. The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show are cited as examples of this shift. The influence of conservative figures in media companies is also discussed, along with the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The article suggests that economic factors and a desire to avoid controversy are driving this shift. The author is concerned that Hollywood may be trading one kind of conformity for another. </p>

          <p>The film, titled *Him*, has been produced by Jordan Peele and has been categorized as a splatter film in the psychological mold of *Us*. However, it deviates from the feel-good formula that has defined American sports movies, recasting football as a meat grinder for its players. The film attempts to critique football's conflation of white Christian values and American jingoism. The reviewer finds the film to be a fumble, and that it ultimately fails to make a cutting takedown of the American football meat grinder. </p>
