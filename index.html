          <p>A federal judge has cautioned the Trump administration that deportations to South Sudan could violate a court order, potentially leading to contempt charges. Judge Brian Murphy stated that the removals might infringe on his previous ruling, which requires migrants to have a meaningful chance to challenge their deportation to third countries. Immigration attorneys reported that a flight carrying individuals, including citizens of Myanmar and Vietnam, had landed in South Sudan, a country grappling with poverty and instability. The judge did not order the plane to return but mandated that the migrants remain in government custody pending further review.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has initiated an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This action follows accusations that Cuomo lied to Congress about his involvement in drafting and editing a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths. Congressional Republicans had previously urged the DOJ to investigate Cuomo, alleging he violated a law against making false statements to Congress. Cuomo's spokesperson claims the former governor testified truthfully and views the investigation as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month due to the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The latest government data reveals a 2% increase in exports, the slowest pace since October of the previous year. The country's exports of transport equipment to the US have fallen, with automobiles, Japan's top export to the US, particularly affected. Economists anticipate that net exports will continue to drag on GDP growth, potentially influencing the central bank's decision on interest rate hikes.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will permit use of COVID vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders said there was evidence to justify approval only for older people and those with medical conditions. The FDA anticipates the need for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo, before approving Covid vaccines for wider use. Some experts worry the new criteria go too far, erecting barriers for people who will want the shots.</p>

          <p>NFL owners are set to discuss a potential ban on the Philadelphia Eagles' signature "Tush Push" play, with a vote expected at the upcoming owners meeting. The play, which involves a quarterback sneak with additional pushing assistance from behind, has been a highly successful strategy for the Eagles. While some argue the play poses safety concerns, data suggests otherwise. The Packers’ proposal cites “player safety” and “pace of play” as reasons for the ban, although many opponents of the play seem to focus on the former argument.</p>
