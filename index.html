The plan, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, involves a phased release of about half the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. An Israeli government spokesperson indicated the country is not interested in "partial deals," signaling potential further negotiations are needed to bridge the gap.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ rating on U.S. sovereign debt, stating that expected revenue from President Trump's tariff policies will likely counteract the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The agency projects that "meaningful" tariff income will balance weaker revenue resulting from the new law. However, S&P warned that the rating could be lowered if deficits increase due to an inability to control spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final sugar beet factory in California, located in Brawley, is set to shut down after 78 years of operation, marking a significant blow to the regional economy. The closure, announced by the Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative, will eliminate approximately 700 jobs and end the state's sugar beet farming industry due to federal processing regulations. The company cited escalating operational costs and broader economic challenges within the U.S. sugar industry as reasons for the decision.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly expanding its iPhone manufacturing operations in India, a move that coincides with the White House pressuring New Delhi over its continued purchase of sanctioned Russian oil. The Trump administration recently hiked tariffs on India and has threatened further action, accusing the country of "profiteering" from the Ukraine war. By increasing production in India, Apple continues its strategy of diversifying its supply chain away from China, a move that may also navigate complex geopolitical and trade tensions.
