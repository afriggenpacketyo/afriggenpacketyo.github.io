          <p>Mediterranean fast-casual chain Cava has significantly reduced its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth, prompting a 20% plunge in its stock price during extended trading. The company now projects growth of 4% to 6%, down from a previous range of 6% to 8%, citing a slowdown after the one-year anniversary of a popular new menu item. While Cava's second-quarter earnings per share beat expectations, its revenue and same-store sales growth fell short of Wall Street projections, reflecting broader struggles in the fast-casual dining sector.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is deliberating whether to revoke its emergency use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children under the age of five. This potential move, confirmed by Pfizer, could leave many young children without an available shot, as Moderna's vaccine is approved only for children with specific health conditions. Pfizer stated that the FDA's review is not related to the vaccine's safety or efficacy and that it is in discussions to keep the authorization for the upcoming fall season. The action is seen by some as part of recent policy shifts under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>E. J. Antoni, an economist from the Heritage Foundation nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), recently suggested the agency should suspend its monthly jobs reports. In an interview prior to his nomination, Antoni questioned the accuracy of the monthly data, which is a crucial economic indicator for markets and the Federal Reserve, arguing for a temporary halt until methodological issues are resolved. The nomination follows Trump's abrupt firing of the previous BLS Commissioner, whom he accused of rigging jobs data, a move that has drawn significant criticism from economists.

          <p>AI company Anthropic announced it will provide its Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government platforms to all three branches of the U.S. government for just one dollar per agency for a year. This strategic move aims to deepen the company's relationship with federal policymakers and regulators amid fierce competition in the AI sector. The offer, which includes technical support, follows a similar initiative by rival OpenAI, which offered its enterprise product to federal agencies for the same price. This highlights the growing trend of major AI firms aggressively pursuing lucrative and influential government contracts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has substantially revised and scaled back the U.S. government's annual global human rights report, a document historically regarded as a comprehensive global study. The new version lessens criticism of American allies like Israel and El Salvador while increasing disapproval of countries such as Brazil and South Africa. Key sections on government corruption and the persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals have been eliminated, which critics argue signals an abandonment of core U.S. values. The State Department claims the changes were made to improve readability and remove redundancies, but human rights advocates have condemned the move as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, asserting that the bank's predictions about the negative economic impact of his tariffs were incorrect. In a social media post, Trump claimed that foreign entities, not U.S. consumers, are bearing the cost of the tariffs and suggested Solomon should focus on his former hobby as a DJ rather than leading a major financial institution. This attack is the latest in a series targeting corporate leaders, and it comes as Goldman Sachs analysts maintain that U.S. consumers have absorbed a significant portion of the tariff costs.

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force and deploy the National Guard to address what he terms "crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor." However, his authority is significantly constrained by the 1973 Home Rule Act, which limits such a federal takeover to a maximum of 30 days without congressional approval. While Trump has pledged sweeping changes, including clearing homeless encampments and ending sanctuary-city policies, he lacks the direct power to implement many of them. Critics have denounced the move as an unnecessary and unlawful overreach, especially as D.C. crime rates have recently declined.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the European Union have publicly appealed to President Trump to protect their security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The European leaders expressed concern that a peace deal for Ukraine could be outlined without their input, potentially through territorial concessions that could embolden Russia. They emphasized that any lasting peace must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The appeal comes as Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, who has been sidelined from the talks, is set to have a virtual meeting with Trump and EU leaders to align positions beforehand.</p>

          <p>Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, saw its shares rise after its first quarterly earnings report as a public company revealed a 53% jump in revenue to $658.1 million. This growth was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash IPO-related charges, the strong revenue and positive market sentiment reflect growing interest in stablecoins from financial institutions. The company also announced plans for a new proprietary blockchain, Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ice-dammed basin at Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier has begun to release massive amounts of water, prompting evacuation orders for residents in parts of Juneau. Officials are warning of a potential record-breaking flood as water from the basin, which fills with rain and snowmelt each summer, flows into the Mendenhall River. This glacial outburst flooding has become an annual event, with floods in the past two years causing significant damage and sweeping away homes. While a temporary levee was installed this year, the predicted crest is expected to surpass previous records.</p>

While most are federally insured, which provides some protections, borrowers can still face foreclosure if they fail to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. The loan balance grows over time, which can deplete the home's equity, reducing the inheritance for heirs or funds for future needs.
