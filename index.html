          <p>President Trump has been briefed on potential actions regarding Iran's Fordo nuclear site, including the possibility of a military strike, due to concerns about Iran's ability to quickly produce nuclear weapons. While Trump has approved attack plans, a final decision is pending, contingent on whether Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. Diplomatic efforts are underway involving the U.K., Germany, France, and the EU to find a resolution, with meetings planned with Iranian officials. Trump has also acknowledged intelligence reports about Iran's potential speed in developing nuclear weapons, but intelligence community sources have not confirmed an active weaponization order from Iran's supreme leader.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a federal appeals court reviews the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, immigration enforcement actions by ICE have accelerated, sparking fear and anxiety among immigrant communities. Advocacy groups report that ICE operations are becoming faster and more discreet, making it difficult to document their actions and provide support to affected individuals. The Trump administration blames Los Angeles's sanctuary policies for the increased enforcement activity, while ICE defends the use of plainclothes officers and masks as necessary for agent safety due to online threats. A class-action lawsuit settlement may require ICE personnel to wear more visible insignia to address confusion, but this will not apply to other federal agencies involved in immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has granted another 90-day extension to the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S., marking the third such delay since January. The extension aims to allow ongoing negotiations for a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, to continue. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year, requiring ByteDance to sever ties with TikTok or face removal from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. While the administration previously reached an agreement for a U.S.-owned company to operate TikTok, ByteDance indicated that Chinese approval is needed and contingent on resolving trade and tariff issues.</p>

          <p>UNCTAD warns that global investment has turned negative in 2025 due to trade tensions and tariff uncertainty, leading to downward revisions in GDP, capital formation, and investor sentiment. A two-year positive trend in manufacturing investments, driven by supply chain diversification, has reversed as companies halt new project constructions and mergers and acquisitions due to tariffs. The report estimates that $100 to $200 billion in project value is at risk globally, with developing countries, particularly those with structurally weak economies, being the most affected. While Africa and developing Asia saw increases in FDI, China experienced a significant slump, and investments aligned with sustainable development goals, such as renewable energy, also declined.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing Â£150 off energy bills to twice as many households this winter. The change will extend the discount to anyone on means-tested benefits, regardless of property size, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million with children. Energy companies will fund the discount, potentially leading to a slight increase in customer bills through the standing charge, but the government anticipates savings from cutting energy companies' expenditure will offset this rise. While welcomed by debt charities and energy groups, some argue the scheme still excludes those on non-means-tested benefits.</p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilt maker, celebrates Juneteenth by sewing, reflecting on the potential role quilts played in the Underground Railroad. Edmunds learned that runaway enslaved people used encoded messages in quilts to navigate their journey north. These quilts, hung outside homes, contained patterns that conveyed messages about when to escape, which direction to follow, and where to find safe houses. While some historians question the lack of written evidence, others argue the secrecy was essential for survival, noting the tradition of symbolic communication in West African cultures.</p>

This practice originates from animism and Brahmanism, which have mixed with Buddhist beliefs, with the red soda serving as a replacement for blood offerings to ghosts. Spirits are believed to have a sweet tooth, and red Fanta is also associated with Kuman Thong, a household deity who can grant wishes. While red Fanta is the most common offering, other red-toned drinks and black drinks, such as Coca-Cola, are also used depending on the specific deity.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is leading the city's response to increased immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal forces by the Trump administration. Bass, a former community organizer, is balancing the need to protect the city's immigrant population with managing protests and addressing concerns about violence and vandalism. She has denounced the Trump administration's characterization of Los Angeles as a war zone and emphasized the importance of immigrants to the city's identity. Bass faces challenges including addressing economic impacts, managing city resources, and ensuring peaceful protests amid heightened tensions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's renewed focus on workplace immigration enforcement, after a brief pause, is raising concerns about potential disruptions in industries reliant on undocumented labor. Sectors such as hospitality, farming, construction, and manufacturing could be severely affected, particularly in states like California, Texas, and Nevada, where undocumented workers make up a significant portion of the workforce. Industry leaders warn that deportations could lead to labor shortages, inflated food prices, and reduced economic activity. Research suggests that deportations may also result in fewer jobs for native-born workers and a significant decrease in U.S. GDP.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance for assessing applications for oil and gas projects, requiring operators to consider emissions from burning the oil and gas produced, not just from production. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that environmental impact assessments must include downstream emissions. The move impacts controversial projects like Rosebank and Jackdaw, though it doesn't guarantee approval, and climate campaigners argue new developments are incompatible with climate commitments. Energy Minister Michael Shanks claims the guidance provides clarity for the North Sea oil and gas industry, but Greenpeace UK criticizes approving projects like Rosebank as a "political sleight of hand."</p>

Researchers found that the land use and financial challenges of such an effort are insurmountable.

The researchers emphasized that reducing carbon emissions at the source is more crucial than relying solely on offsets.</p>

          <p>The principal of Dundee University and two senior members of its governing body have resigned following a critical report into the university's financial collapse, which required a Â£22 million government bailout. The report found that university leaders and the governing body repeatedly failed to identify the worsening financial crisis and continued to overspend. Former principal Prof Iain Gillespie was criticized for an "overbearing leadership style" and a resistance to difficult conversations. The report highlighted poor financial judgment and weak governance as key factors in the university's financial downfall.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance has joined social media platform Bluesky, inviting his X followers to join him on the new platform. Vance stated that he had been told Bluesky was "the place to go for common sense political discussion and analysis." Bluesky is styled as a progressive alternative to X, which has been criticized for allowing hate speech and misinformation to flourish since being acquired by Elon Musk. Vance praised the US Supreme Court recently banning gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender youth.</p>
