        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that long-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Powell noted significant changes over the past five years, including surging inflation that led to aggressive interest rate hikes. He cautioned that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon and that more frequent and persistent supply shocks pose a challenge for central banks. While he didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, Powell acknowledged their potential to slow growth and boost inflation, making policy decisions more complex. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on China, the company may be forced to raise prices. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's trade levies hinder the retailer's ability to maintain low prices due to narrow retail margins. Price hikes are expected to take effect later this month. Additionally, Walmart has withdrawn its quarterly profit outlook due to global economic uncertainty, as Trump aims to secure favorable trade deals with countries facing import levies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird living in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that federal officials made an error when listing the bird under the Act, claiming the listing should be tossed out. This move has raised concerns among environmentalists, as prairie-chickens overlap with oil and gas drilling areas, and the administration has signaled prioritizing drilling over environmental safeguards. Scientists estimate that the range of lesser prairie-chickens has shrunk significantly due to habitat loss.</p>
