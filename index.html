          <p>Friday's newspaper front pages are dominated by two main stories. Several papers feature the man charged in connection with the Liverpool victory parade incident, with titles like 'Face of Liverpool horror'. The Guardian also highlights Britain's potential Â£1.6 billion trade agreement with Gulf states, noting concerns from rights groups about human rights and environmental provisions. Other papers cover Attorney General Lord Hermer's comparison of politicians' threats to abandon international law to 1930s Nazi Germany, as well as Kemi Badenoch's criticism of Nigel Farage and Keir Starmer's welfare policies. The Daily Express reports on a new blood test for cancer being rolled out by the NHS.</p>

          <p>Japan's industrial output experienced a decrease of 0.9% in April, according to recent reports. This decline reflects shifts in the country's manufacturing sector and broader economic conditions.

Further analysis will be needed to determine the full impact of this industrial output decline on Japan's economic performance.</p>

          <p>Despite sanctions, Russia continues to generate billions from fossil fuel exports to the West, which helps finance its invasion of Ukraine. Data shows that Western allies have paid Russia more for hydrocarbons than they have provided in aid to Ukraine since the start of the conflict. Campaigners argue that European and North American governments need to take stronger measures to stop Russian oil and gas from fueling the war. Western policymakers fear that cutting imports of Russian fuels will lead to higher energy prices.</p>

The screening was made possible by a community petition, as the town lacks a movie theater. Coogler, along with composer Ludwig GÃ¶ransson and actor Miles Caton, engaged with the expressive crowd, which responded enthusiastically to the film. The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale and is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint, while also being a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.</p>

          <p>Gap shares experienced a significant drop after the retailer announced that new tariffs could cost the company between $100 million and $150 million. The company is taking steps to mitigate these costs, including diversifying its supply chain and reducing exposure to China. Despite beating expectations in its fiscal first-quarter results, Gap's guidance was mixed, with a weaker-than-expected gross margin forecast. The new tariffs are throwing a wrench into Gap's plans to turn around the legacy retailer, but the company remains focused on strengthening its brands and gaining market share.</p>

Cramer notes that hope for trade deals has fueled the S&P 500's rally, but uncertainty over the legal challenges could temper enthusiasm. He also points out that if the Supreme Court sides against the White House, retailers may not need to raise prices to pass on tariff pain. (not investment advice)</p>
