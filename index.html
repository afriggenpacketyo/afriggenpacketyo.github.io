          <p>China has successfully completed a massive ecological project in Inner Mongolia, creating an 1,856km green belt to contain the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. The project, part of the nation's 'green great wall' initiative, utilizes straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation. This method aims to build an effective sand prevention and control system, strengthening the region's ecological barrier against desertification. The completion marks a significant milestone in China's long-term efforts to combat environmental degradation and land erosion.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced a significant policy shift by approving the delivery of defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move he had previously resisted. This reversal comes after he expressed renewed displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a cabinet meeting. The article explores the potential reasons for this change in strategy, questioning if it signals a deteriorating relationship between Trump and Putin. The development is discussed alongside other recent events, including another meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the announcement of new trade tariffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to reduce the federal workforce. This ruling allows for the potential termination of hundreds of thousands of government employees while legal challenges continue in lower courts. The decision was unsigned, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson being the only justice to publicly dissent, warning of mass terminations and the dismantling of federal programs. This action is one of several recent instances where the Supreme Court has sided with the administration on contentious policy issues.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi to 14 years in prison as part of a mass trial involving 21 individuals. Ghannouchi, leader of the Ennahda party, and others faced charges including attempting to overthrow the government and involvement in terrorist activities, which his defense team claims are based on false testimony. This event is part of a broader crackdown on dissent by President Kais Saied, who dissolved parliament in 2021. Critics and human rights activists argue these actions are undermining the democratic progress made since the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles and Other Municipalities Join Lawsuit to Halt Federal Immigration Raids</h2>

          <p>The city and county of Los Angeles, along with several other local governments, are seeking to join a lawsuit aimed at stopping what they term 'unconstitutional' immigration raids by the Trump administration. The lawsuit, originally filed by the ACLU, claims federal agents are conducting unlawful detentions and instilling fear in communities. Local officials argue the raids obstruct law enforcement and harm the local economy. This legal action comes as the administration's immigration crackdown in Southern California has resulted in over 1,600 arrests in its first few weeks.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges are for the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender, specifically targeting girls and women in Afghanistan. The court alleges that since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have systematically deprived females of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression. While the Taliban dismissed the warrants as 'nonsense,' the move represents a significant step by the international community to hold the regime accountable for its oppressive policies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reported that the number of arrests in its ongoing immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles has reached nearly 2,800 since it began in early June. The aggressive operation has drawn widespread condemnation from local and state officials, who accuse the federal government of terrorizing immigrant communities and disrupting daily life. The latest figures show an acceleration in detentions, with nearly 1,200 arrests occurring in just over two weeks. This crackdown is seen as a key test of the Trump administration's expansive use of executive authority for immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on imported copper, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the metal's supply chain. The move, which is expected to take effect soon, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, and the U.S. imports about half of its supply, primarily from Chile and Canada. This action is part of the administration's broader strategy of using tariffs to protect and promote American industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas have renewed focus on the Trump administration's significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA. Since February, the NWS has lost approximately 600 staff members, including meteorologists and hydrologists, leading to high vacancy rates in some offices. While experts believe the NWS performed well in forecasting this specific event, they warn that continued cuts could compromise the agency's ability to provide timely warnings for future weather disasters. The tragedy underscores the critical importance of a fully staffed and funded national weather infrastructure.</p>
