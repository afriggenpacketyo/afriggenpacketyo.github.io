          <p>A former champion of the British game show 'Countdown' stabbed a rival player during a fan club event in Blackpool. The court heard that the attacker, a Cambridge maths graduate, felt other competitors were cheating by using an app to practice online. The incident, captured on CCTV, resulted in the victim receiving a stab wound to his bicep. The judge ruled the defendant unfit for trial due to being "seriously mentally unwell," and a jury determined the facts of the assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are evaluating the best options for their money. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a fixed interest rate, which can lock in current higher returns before rates fall, but require keeping funds deposited for a set term. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but have variable rates that will likely decrease following the Fed's decision. The choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus the desire for guaranteed returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. This highlights the deep economic interdependence between the two nations but also underscores the risks of over-reliance on a single trading partner. While exports, primarily soybeans, iron ore, and oil, generate a significant trade surplus for Brazil, they are concentrated among a small number of companies. The report suggests this concentration makes the Brazilian economy vulnerable.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is appealing a federal judge's decision that blocked the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had ruled that Cook's potential reinstatement was in the public interest to maintain the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump sought to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her lawyers argue the move is part of a broader pressure campaign by the president to influence the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>

Additionally, the climate is in an "ENSO Neutral" phase, lacking the La Niña conditions that typically fuel a more active Atlantic season. Forecasters, however, still predict an above-average season overall, as 60% of the season remains and a transition to La Niña is expected.</p>

          <p>At the IAA auto show in Munich, European automakers like Volkswagen are moving away from futuristic electric vehicle designs in favor of more familiar, traditional aesthetics. VW's new ID.Polo, for example, is designed to look friendly and is named after a classic model to broaden its appeal beyond early adopters. This strategy shift, also seen at Mercedes and BMW, aims to make EVs more accessible to mainstream consumers by leveraging brand recognition and classic design cues. The change includes bringing back physical buttons for controls in response to customer feedback.</p>

          <p>This Guardian editorial condemns Israel's recent airstrike in Doha, which targeted Hamas's ceasefire negotiation team, as evidence of Prime Minister Netanyahu's lack of commitment to peace. The article argues that the attack sabotaged promising negotiations and was met with a weak response from the United States and other Western powers. The piece contends that this passivity allows Netanyahu's far-right government to act with impunity and cross red lines, calling for stronger diplomatic and economic pressure from the UK and EU. It suggests that only the U.S. can ultimately force a change in Israel's approach.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown deadline just three weeks away, Democrats and Republicans in Congress are still far from an agreement on a funding deal. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that the current Republican proposal is insufficient to secure Democratic votes. The White House has requested a short-term funding extension through January, but disagreements persist over this timeline and other policy additions, such as an extension of health care subsidies. The partisan standoff raises the risk of a shutdown as both sides blame the other for the lack of progress on appropriations bills.</p>

          <p>The leader of the RMT union, representing thousands of striking London Underground workers, has called for a summit with Mayor Sadiq Khan to resolve the ongoing dispute over pay and working hours. The industrial action, which began on Sunday, has caused significant travel disruption across the capital. The union's central demand is a 32-hour work week, which Transport for London (TfL) has called "impractical and unaffordable," countering with a 3.4% pay offer. The union hopes the mayor's direct intervention can help break the deadlock after previous talks failed.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her forthcoming book, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris criticizes the handling of President Joe Biden's reelection bid, calling it "recklessness" to leave the decision to run solely to him. She suggests the stakes were too high for it to be a personal choice based on an "individual's ego." Harris also expresses frustration with her time in the administration, claiming the president's staff fueled negative narratives about her and failed to defend her against attacks. She writes that while she is loyal to Biden, her loyalty to the country is greater.</p>

          <p>A large-scale survey of nearly 70,000 U.S. college students reveals that a majority now oppose allowing speakers with controversial views, from either the left or right, on campus. The annual report from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) shows a growing trend of students preferring to avoid ideological encounters rather than engage in debate. The survey also found a record-high level of acceptance for disruptive tactics, with one in three students believing violence is at least "rarely" acceptable to stop a campus speech. This indicates a significant shift in campus climate toward censorship.</p>

          <p>Comedian and writer Julio Torres makes his theatrical debut with "Color Theories," a comedic play that explores his imaginative worldview through the personalities of colors. The review praises the play's surrealist stage design and Torres's unique ability to blend whimsical observations with poignant social commentary. He uses colors like "law and order" navy blue and "relaxed" green to discuss topics ranging from American capitalism and bureaucracy to his personal experiences with immigration. The play is described as a concise and humorous portrait of how power structures shape everyday reality, delivered with a charmingly absurdist perspective.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education announced it will take a more proactive approach to improving financial literacy by sharing information with students and families about the risks and benefits of federal student loans. The initiative comes as outstanding student debt approaches $1.7 trillion and default rates remain at record highs. The department's Ombudsman's office will lead the effort to help students make more informed borrowing decisions. However, experts question the program's potential effectiveness, citing recent staff layoffs at the agency and a massive backlog of applications for income-driven repayment plans.

The judge, who previously ruled that the administration had broken federal law with the deployment, stated he was unsure of his authority to act while the case is on appeal. The initial ruling found the administration had willfully overstepped its authority by using troops for domestic law enforcement during protests. The state sought to block a 90-day extension of the deployment, calling it a form of "military occupation."</p>
