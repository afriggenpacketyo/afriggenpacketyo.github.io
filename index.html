        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Onondaga County District Attorney has given eleven students involved in an alleged hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team 48 hours to surrender, or face kidnapping charges. The incident involved older players luring younger teammates to an isolated area under the guise of a team outing, where masked accomplices simulated an abduction. The DA emphasized the severity of the incident, calling it "hazing on steroids" and noting the potential for tragedy, particularly if law enforcement had encountered the scene. As of Tuesday, no charges had been filed, but the DA indicated that those who turn themselves in may avoid criminal records and be prosecuted in family court.</p>

          <p>UBS has reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter, driven by strong performance in investment banking, but the bank is warning of the potential global trade impact of sweeping U.S. tariffs. The bank's CEO, Sergio Ermotti, acknowledged a challenging environment with volatile market conditions, while also reporting a decline in net interest income and guiding for further declines in the coming quarter. UBS has also confirmed it has completed $500 million in share buybacks and intends to press ahead with a $2.5 billion repurchase plan for the remainder of 2025.

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep and Dodge, has withdrawn its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties surrounding the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. The company reported a 14% drop in first-quarter net revenues, citing lower shipment volumes and adverse regional mix. While Stellantis will scrap its 2025 financial guidance due to tariff-related uncertainties, it also said it is "highly engaged" with policymakers on tariff policies. The announcement comes shortly after the automotive sector received some relief from the Trump administration, which watered down some auto tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning Oklahoma's attempt to establish the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. A ruling in favor of the school could have significant implications for the separation of church and state, potentially opening the door for public funds to flow directly to religious schools. Oklahoma's Attorney General argues that such a move would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, while supporters of St. Isidore contend that it is simply an application of previous Supreme Court rulings that prevent discrimination against religious institutions. With Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused, a 4-4 deadlock is possible.</p>

          <p>The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal income tax credit available to business owners who hire candidates from certain target groups facing employment barriers. Employers can claim a tax credit equal to 40% of the qualified employee's first-year wages (if the employee works at least 400 hours) up to $2,400 per qualifying employee, but it can go as high as $9,600 for certain veterans. To claim the credit, employers must pre-screen applicants, submit paperwork to the state workforce agency, and receive certification. The credit incentivizes inclusive hiring practices and supports workforce diversity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of the year by 0.3%, according to official data, amid the implementation of sweeping tariffs. The contraction is attributed to a surge in imports as consumers and companies anticipated the tariffs, coupled with a fall in consumer sentiment. While President Trump blamed his predecessor, economists suggest the GDP decline is largely due to businesses purchasing imports in anticipation of tariffs. The economic outlook remains uncertain, with potential for further volatility as markets react to new tariff-related developments.</p>

The interview became a half-hour special on KOMU, a local television station. Years later, Nazemi established college funds for Anderson's children, demonstrating the lasting impact of Anderson's kindness.

The policies, and the uncertainty they created, were enough to push economic growth into reverse in the first quarter. Economists widely expect spending and investment to slow in the months ahead, as tariffs drive up prices and uncertainty keeps businesses on hold.</p>

The ITC is considering tariffs on Chinese-made golf carts, which could benefit domestic players but also force them to raise prices or sacrifice profit margins.

While HELOCs offer lower interest rates than credit cards and flexibility, experts caution about the risks associated with variable rates. A HELOC makes sense for those with stable income, a clear purpose for borrowing, and a healthy housing market, but may not be suitable for those with unstable income, a lack of clear purpose, or a declining housing market. Alternatives include home equity loans and cash-out refinance loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The biggest driver of those savings was the reduction by more than 40% of major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes, compared with patients who were not taking the drugs, as well as a reduction in the onset of diabetes.</p>
