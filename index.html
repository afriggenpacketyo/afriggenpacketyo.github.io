          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump are not legally permissible, dealing a significant blow to his trade strategy. The decision upholds a lower court's finding that the tariffs exceeded presidential authority under economic emergency laws, though it will not immediately block them. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant unlimited tariff authority, a power it considers core to Congress. The Trump administration has until October to appeal to the Supreme Court, with the Attorney General vowing to challenge the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

This would be the state's 13th scheduled execution this year, extending its record for the most inmates put to death in a single year since 1976. The state has executed more people in 2025 than any other, surpassing its previous record of eight in 2014. Jones's legal team is expected to file appeals with both the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts to block the execution.</p>

          <p>Charles Borges, the Chief Data Officer for the Social Security Administration, has resigned days after filing a whistleblower complaint. He alleged that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded the entire country's Social Security data to a "vulnerable cloud environment." The SSA has refuted the claim, stating the data was "walled off" from the internet. In his resignation letter, Borges cited retaliation and a hostile work environment, making it impossible for him to perform his duties ethically.</p>

Analysts suggest the trend could continue as China's US$22 trillion in savings seeks better returns than low-yield fixed-income products. Global asset managers are turning positive on Chinese equities, citing "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics. This shift reverses years of underperformance and foreign investor exodus from the combined US$20 trillion market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Live-Fire Military Drills Linked to Hundreds of Wildfires Across the UK</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Live-fire military training exercises have been identified as the cause of hundreds of wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land in the UK since 2023. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, some dating back to World War II, making it too dangerous for crews to access the areas. Figures obtained by the BBC show that military maneuvers caused 385 of the 439 wildfires on MoD land between January 2023 and last month.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The court unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's actions were unlawful. The judges argued that Congress designed the TPS statute to be predictable and insulated from electoral politics, and the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to vacate a prior extension. The ruling provides temporary relief for TPS holders who faced potential job loss and deportation.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated his administration has not been contacted about the plan and suggested President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. This follows the deployment of federal agents and National Guard troops to other cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker's handling of Chicago's crime rate, escalating the conflict between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars in television advertising are set to begin, targeting California voters ahead of a November special election on Proposition 50. The ballot measure asks voters to approve new congressional district boundaries drawn to favor Democrats, a move initiated to counter Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas. Both supporters and opponents of the measure have booked millions in airtime, signaling an expensive and intense campaign. The outcome will likely impact control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the fate of President Trump's policies, turning a typically obscure process into a high-stakes partisan battle.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has canceled $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that had already been approved by Congress. The administration used a little-known procedure called a "pocket rescission" to withhold funds for 15 international programs, bypassing the typical congressional approval process. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who warn it increases the likelihood of a government shutdown, and even from some moderate Republicans who question its legality. The cuts will heavily impact USAID and funding for peacekeeping missions, further aligning with Trump's "America First" policy.</p>

The research, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, revealed that about 42% of children aged 3 to 5 were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines recommend starting with behavioral intervention first, as medication can have side effects like irritability and emotional problems in young children.

Analysts suggest that the rise of home coffee machines and a preference for supporting smaller, independent shops are also challenging established giants.

The protest was eventually handled by security, and the performance resumed, though the incident highlights the ongoing use of cultural events as venues for political demonstration.</p>

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than a year, citing persistent adverse market conditions. The airline, which only emerged from its last reorganization in March, stated it has "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operating over the next year. Spirit plans to conduct business as usual during the restructuring, with flights and loyalty programs remaining active. The company has struggled with weak demand for domestic leisure travel and rising operational costs since the pandemic, and recent cost-cutting measures, including pilot furloughs, have not been sufficient to stabilize its finances.

          <p>The UK's Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling, allowing 138 asylum seekers to remain at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction, sought by the local council, would have forced their removal, but the appellate court found the original decision "seriously flawed." The ruling is a victory for the government, which feared a precedent that could trigger legal challenges from other councils over the use of hotels for asylum accommodation. The hotel has been the site of numerous protests and counter-protests, and the judge warned that using protests as a basis for legal action risks encouraging further lawlessness.</p>

          <h2>New Texas Congressional Map Puts GOP's Recent Gains with Latino Voters to the Test</h2>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new congressional map, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, which is designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the U.S. House. The mid-decade redistricting effort heavily relies on the GOP's ability to retain the support of Hispanic voters, with four of the new districts having Hispanic majorities. This move is a high-stakes gamble for the party, as recent polls suggest some Latino voters who supported Trump are now concerned about the economy and immigration policies. The new map tests whether the GOP's 2024 inroads with this demographic represent a permanent political realignment or a temporary shift.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. His protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which he blames on Republican inaction in the legislature. SEPTA is facing a $213 million deficit and has warned of a "death spiral" if it does not receive more state funding. Kenyatta is framing his march as part of a "time honoured American tradition" of protest to highlight the impact of the funding crisis on workers, students, and the elderly.</p>

          <p>A San Bernardino man, Francisco Longoria, has been arrested and charged with assaulting federal officers, weeks after he spoke out publicly about a CBP officer shooting at his truck. His attorneys state that federal agents used military-style tactics, including an armored vehicle, to raid his home early in the morning. The initial incident occurred when masked officers stopped Longoria's truck for an "immigration check," and an officer fired at the vehicle as Longoria drove away, fearing for his safety. While DHS claims officers were injured, Longoria's lawyers have released video they say contradicts this and believe the arrest is retaliation for speaking out.</p>

          <p>Residents of Mexico City are protesting against rising gentrification, which they attribute to an influx of American and European tourists and digital nomads. Demonstrators in trendy neighborhoods like Condesa are angry about soaring rent prices and the conversion of long-term housing into short-term rentals, which is forcing out local families. Some protests have turned violent, with demonstrators chanting "Gringos Out!" and vandalizing businesses catering to foreigners. The issue has been exacerbated since the pandemic, highlighting a cultural and economic clash as locals feel displaced from their own communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's engagement with the cryptocurrency industry has evolved into a complex blend of policy, personal enrichment, and political strategy. Since campaigning to make the U.S. a "crypto capital," his administration has pursued mass deregulation while his family and businesses have launched numerous crypto-related ventures, from memecoins to a new $6.4 billion partnership with Crypto.com. This embrace of the industry rewards campaign donors and inflates his personal net worth, which is now significantly tied to the crypto market. Critics note this represents a significant conflict of interest and a departure from crypto's anti-establishment origins. (not investment advice)</p>
