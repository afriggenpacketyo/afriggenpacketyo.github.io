        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets demonstrated resilience, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising over 2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 hitting a record high, even as China reported a 4.8% GDP growth for the third quarter, which aligned with expectations. Despite this growth, the article notes an unexpected contraction in fixed-asset investment, indicating underlying economic challenges. The broader market strength was also influenced by a more conciliatory tone in U.S.-China trade discussions and a recovery from recent U.S. regional bank sell-offs. This suggests investors are weighing diverse factors, including regional political stability and specific national economic indicators, to shape overall market optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce new powers allowing UK troops to shoot down drones threatening military bases, a significant shift from previous protocols that only permitted diversion or GPS disruption. This move comes after several incidents, including mystery drone sightings at four British airbases used by US forces last year, and broader airspace disruptions across Europe. The article notes these powers, initially for military sites, might extend to civilian airports, reflecting a growing urgency to counter drone threats. This initiative is part of a wider European response, with some EU states planning a "drone wall" to detect and destroy Russian drones.</p>

          <p>A Tesla Cybertruck owner faced a significant financial loss when his practically new vehicle, with only 800 miles, failed to recoup even 70% of its initial $102,000 asking price at auction. The highest bid was $69,420, illustrating a steep depreciation for the controversial electric vehicle. The article attributes this to Tesla's broader struggles, including sales slumps, fluctuating stocks, a talent exodus, and eight recalls for the Cybertruck within 18 months.
