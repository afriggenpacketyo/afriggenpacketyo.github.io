          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, England, has fully immersed himself in the culture of the 1940s, a passion that began with his childhood interest in the world wars. The teenager, named Lincoln, dresses exclusively in 1940s attire, listens to music from the era, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He works at a 1940s-themed tea room and antiques shop, where he is beloved by customers for his knowledge and passion. Lincoln says he admires the period's sense of community and elegance and feels it's important to remember the sacrifices made during that time.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote, which was delayed for hours due to Democratic demands for a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein-related files, passed mostly along party lines at 216-213. The package cuts approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance programs like USAID and $1 billion from public media, a long-standing goal for some Republicans. The legislation, which now goes to President Trump for his signature, overcame controversy and heated debate to meet its passage deadline.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved President Trump's plan to rescind $9 billion in funding, a move that eliminates all federal support for NPR and PBS and cuts about $7 billion in foreign aid. The House passed the measure 216-to-213, sending it to the president's desk. NPR's CEO called the decision an "irreversible loss" that would dismantle local civic institutions, particularly harming rural and underserved communities that rely on public broadcasting for news and emergency alerts. Despite some Republican senators expressing concerns over the cuts' impact on their constituents, the package ultimately passed after extensive debate.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods unless legal charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro are dropped. Lula described the threat as "unacceptable blackmail" and a grave attack on Brazil's national sovereignty and judicial independence. The charges against Bolsonaro relate to an alleged coup attempt following the 2022 election. Trump has publicly supported Bolsonaro and criticized the Brazilian judiciary, while Lula has labeled Brazilian politicians who support Trump's stance as "traitors to the homeland," escalating diplomatic tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Alexander Hurst reflects on reaching the age of 35 and the realization that adulthood is a continuous process of "winging it" rather than a destination of certainty. He uses the French comedy series "Bref" as a bookend for his own journey, contrasting its depiction of a chaotic youth with a more contemplative middle age. The author discusses his experience as an American immigrant in France, the nature of regret, and the challenge of living a personally fulfilling life amidst global turmoil. He concludes that while answers are scarce, the process of building a life is what gives it meaning.</p>

Using 5,000 yuan (about $700) he had saved, he purchased steel plates, an engine, and a battery.

However, the move has drawn skepticism and criticism, coming just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount Global for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump.

While grand jury records are typically kept secret, Bondi stated her readiness to file a motion with the court.

The most significant drop was in the area of government-market relations, indicating increased government intervention in the economy. Experts warn that reversing this trend is crucial to address economic imbalances and intense, unproductive competition within industries. (not investment advice)</p>

However, underlying inflationary pressures persist, and economists remain cautious due to the depreciating yen and the threat of U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The surprising announcement that CBS is ending "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is being questioned as more than just a financial decision, as the network claims. This article suggests the move is part of a pattern of CBS and its parent company, Paramount, capitulating to President Donald Trump. The decision follows CBS settling a lawsuit with Trump and the departure of the head of "60 Minutes" under pressure. Colbert has been a consistent and prominent critic of Trump, and ending his show, despite its high ratings, is seen by some as a move to appease the administration ahead of a major corporate merger requiring federal approval.</p>

He framed the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity, especially for productions with smaller budgets. The use of generative AI remains a controversial topic in Hollywood, having been a key concern during the 2023 actors' strike over fears it could replace human workers.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a benign and common condition where leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart. The announcement aims to address public speculation fueled by images showing Trump with swollen legs and a bruised hand, which the White House attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump "remains in excellent health."</p>

          <p>The state of California is suing the Trump administration following its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, claims the administration's action was "arbitrary and capricious" and motivated by President Trump's "personal animus" toward the project. The funding was intended for construction in the Central Valley. Governor Gavin Newsom called the move a "heartless attack" on the region that will jeopardize jobs. The administration cited significant budget shortfalls and missed deadlines as justification for pulling the funds from the long-delayed project.</p>

          <p>A former senior intelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency has described China's experiments to create biologically enhanced soldiers as a "disturbing" reality. The comments follow remarks from Senator Mark Warner about China's efforts to use gene-editing and other technologies to create soldiers with superior physical and mental capabilities. The expert, Nicholas Eftimiades, noted that while the concept is not new, it is concerning that the research is being conducted by the People's Liberation Army.

          <p>Police in Madison, Wisconsin, are searching for a group of female suspects who allegedly attacked another woman for taking too long in a restaurant bathroom. The incident occurred at a Raising Cane's restaurant shortly after midnight on June 8. According to the police report, the suspects began punching the victim as soon as she exited the restroom. A second person who attempted to intervene was also assaulted. Both victims required hospitalization for their injuries, and police are seeking to arrest the unidentified suspects on charges including substantial battery and disorderly conduct.</p>

          <p>President Trump's long-standing criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has resurfaced, with reports that the president inquired about the possibility of firing him. Trump's dissatisfaction stems from the Fed's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, a policy the president believes is stifling economic growth. While the legality of firing a Fed chair is untested, Trump has publicly called Powell a "moron" and urged him to cut rates immediately. The Federal Reserve operates independently to set monetary policy, balancing the goals of low unemployment and stable prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids at a Home Depot and other locations in Sacramento in what appeared to be a deliberate challenge to California's sanctuary policies. A Border Patrol chief recorded a video in front of the state capitol, stating, "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation, which resulted in 11 arrests, was condemned by Governor Gavin Newsom's office as "illegal racial profiling." The raids occurred just days after a federal judge blocked agents from using racial profiling in arrests in Southern California, raising questions about the legality of the Sacramento enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reversed its previous ban, now allowing Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market. The agency concluded that the company's studies demonstrate its products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision is a significant milestone for Juul, which was widely blamed for fueling the teen vaping epidemic and has faced years of legal and financial struggles. Anti-tobacco advocates heavily criticized the move, arguing the product responsible for the public health crisis should not be authorized for sale.</p>

The announcement follows a pattern of the president seeking to score political points with his base, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement. While some, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have praised the move, public health experts point out that there is little to no metabolic difference between the two sweeteners. Critics suggest the change is largely symbolic, as sugar-sweetened beverages remain a major contributor to health issues regardless of the sugar's source.</p>

Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size restrictions on liquids might be the next policy to be updated. The potential change follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening. The current rule, in place since a foiled 2006 terror plot, limits passengers to liquids in containers of 3.4 ounces or less.</p>
