          <p>The Mayo Clinic is utilizing a fecal waste biobank to research how the microbiome influences cancer patients' responses to medication. The biobank, containing over 2,000 stool samples, aims to personalize medicine by identifying which drugs patients are most likely to respond to based on their microbiome and genes. Researchers are exploring fecal transplants and other methods to manipulate the gut microbiome, potentially improving cancer treatment outcomes. This work is occurring amidst proposed budget cuts to US scientific institutions, raising concerns about the ability of private entities to fill the funding gap left by the government.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants to fund Donald Trump's immigration enforcement efforts, potentially creating financial barriers for asylum seekers, children, and survivors of crimes. These fees, which do not currently exist, would require immigrants to pay for asylum applications, work permits, and humanitarian parole, with limited exceptions for waivers. Experts warn that these fees could force vulnerable immigrants into exploitative work or out of the country altogether. The legislation allocates significant funds for border wall construction and increased ICE operations, reflecting the Trump administration's priority of restricting immigration. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to deport international students for pro-Palestinian activism have faced legal challenges, with judges ordering the release of several detained scholars. The administration argues that their presence is harmful to US foreign policy, sparking criticism of political repression on campuses. While the administration is facing defeats in court, the fundamental legal question of whether the government can deport non-citizens for their political speech remains unresolved and may reach the Supreme Court. Despite the legal challenges, the arrests have instilled anxiety among international students and contributed to a climate of fear on US campuses.</p>

These soldiers, who have fought in various units and regions, voiced bitterness towards Russian officials and civilians whom they accuse of profiting from the war while ignoring the hardships faced on the front lines. They want to take all of the regions so that they don't have to struggle for them in the future. The soldiers' sentiments highlight the challenges Vladimir Putin would face in integrating servicemen back into civilian life and transitioning the wartime economy.</p>

The plants in question are the Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of its subsidiary Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka, which account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. These closures, if implemented, would mark Nissan's first plant shutdowns in Japan since 2001 and are attributed to lower operating rates due to sluggish sales of specific models.</p>

          <p>A raid on Abbyâ€™s Bakery in Los Fresnos, Texas, has highlighted the impact of President Trump's immigration policies on a Latino-majority community. The owners, Leonardo Baez and Nora Alicia Avila, face charges of harboring undocumented workers, stirring division and anxiety in the area. While the Justice Department frames the case as straightforward, local residents view it as a targeted attack on a minority-owned business. The community has rallied in support of the bakery, while others emphasize the importance of upholding the law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure and declaring it an essential health benefit. A White House report is expected to make recommendations for reducing out-of-pocket costs for I.V.F. treatment. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has not been invited to participate in the discussions, raising concerns about the process. The administration's efforts are complicated by conflicting views within Mr. Trump's base, as some Christian conservatives oppose I.V.F. due to concerns about the disposal of embryos.</p>
