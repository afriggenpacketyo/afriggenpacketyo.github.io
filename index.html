          <h2>Chinese Media Criticizes Trump's Ocean Pollution Claims</h2>

          <p>Chinese state media has responded to US President Donald Trump's accusations of China being a major source of ocean pollution, labeling his claims as misleading and based on altered or outdated images. The Paper, a Shanghai-based newspaper, conducted a fact-check, revealing that the photos Trump shared on social media were not taken in China and one was digitally manipulated. This media rebuttal highlights the strained relationship between the two nations, further diminishing the likelihood of improved diplomatic ties and underscoring ongoing tensions regarding environmental responsibilities. The report was widely shared across Chinese social media platforms, amplifying the message of alleged misinformation from the US president.</p>

          <p>Issa Quincy's poem, 'Guest House,' evokes a series of fragmented memories and sensory impressions, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The poem blends images of nature, childhood, and domestic life, hinting at themes of memory, loss, and the passage of time. The juxtaposition of contrasting elements, such as 'silent summer warmth' and 'a black milk,' adds to the poem's enigmatic and evocative quality. The final image of the night sinking suggests a sense of closure or acceptance.</p>

          <p>A recent Army Black Hawk helicopter crash at Reagan National Airport, which resulted in multiple fatalities, is being attributed to a series of missteps during a common aviation practice. The crew requested and received permission to use "visual separation," allowing them to navigate around other aircraft independently. However, this practice, when mishandled, can lead to dangerous situations, as occurred in this instance. Aviation experts have long warned about the potential risks associated with visual separation if not executed properly.</p>

A '60 Minutes' executive producer resigned, citing pressure from the parent company, Paramount, to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with Kamala Harris. Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount, reportedly wants to settle the lawsuit to facilitate a sale of the company, raising concerns about political influence over journalistic integrity.

          <p>The author argues that Donald Trump's governing philosophy is rooted in a quest for absolute power, demonstrated by his actions towards the Department of Justice and his use of executive orders. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to detain migrants and his praise for authoritarian leaders like Nayib Bukele are cited as examples of his disregard for due process and traditional conservative values. The author draws parallels between Trump's approach and the legal theories of Carl Schmitt, a Nazi legal scholar, emphasizing the threat Trump poses to constitutional law.</p>

          <p>Conservation groups are voicing concerns over President Trump's decision to reverse fishing regulations in the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine national monument. This action allows commercial fishing in a protected area, potentially endangering threatened species and fragile ecosystems. Experts warn of the risk of illegal fishing and bycatch, impacting shark and sea turtle populations. The decision also raises concerns about the long-term effects on American fishers and seafood prices.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the potential for abuse of power arising from the centralization of US federal government data. It highlights concerns that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under Elon Musk's oversight, is gaining access to sensitive data across various agencies, potentially combining it with private-sector data. This could enable the government to target individuals or groups based on political affiliations or other characteristics. The article explores the historical safeguards against such data consolidation and the potential consequences of their erosion under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The vanished kingdom of Kaabu, which existed from the 1500s to the 1800s in present-day Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, is being brought to life through the songs of griots and a new archaeological dig. Griots, West African storytellers, have preserved the history of Kaabu through oral tradition, inspiring archaeologists to excavate its capital city, Kansala. The excavation has uncovered physical evidence of the kingdom, validating the stories passed down by griots. The project emphasizes the importance of Africans telling their own history and the collaboration between archaeologists and griots in preserving cultural heritage.</p>
