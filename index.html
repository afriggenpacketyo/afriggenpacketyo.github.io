          <p>The U.S. government has officially rescinded its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software to China, a development confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This decision reverses earlier mandates from May that required companies to obtain licenses for exporting goods vital to semiconductor production. The affected companies, including Germany's Siemens EDA, collectively hold a significant share of the global electronic design automation market. This policy adjustment is seen as a component of a broader trade truce, aiming to restore access for Chinese clients and potentially de-escalate ongoing economic tensions between the two nations, impacting global tech supply chains.</p>

          <p>A skydiving aircraft carrying 15 people crashed at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, after the pilot reported engine trouble post-takeoff. The incident led to injuries for 14 individuals, with three critically hurt, but no fatalities were reported, a fact emergency officials deemed "amazing." Responders, who had recently conducted a mass casualty training exercise at the airport, swiftly managed the scene. The small Cessna 208B was only in the air for four minutes before attempting an unsuccessful landing. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating, noting the plane's involvement in a previous incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are encountering significant challenges in passing President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, which encompasses substantial tax cuts, increased border security funding, and defense spending. A critical procedural vote faced strong resistance from within the GOP, with both moderates and conservative hardliners expressing dissatisfaction over changes made by the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson is actively working to garner sufficient support, keeping the vote open to sway reluctant members. The legislation, a cornerstone of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, must overcome these internal divisions to meet its self-imposed July 4 deadline, highlighting the complexities of legislative consensus.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively pursuing deeper relations with China, with its top diplomat, Ararat Mirzoyan, indicating mutual readiness to elevate bilateral ties to a strategic level. This diplomatic push comes as Armenia diversifies its foreign policy, moving beyond its traditional reliance on Russia. The shift follows the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent events in 2023, which saw significant Armenian displacement and a perceived lack of Russian intervention. Armenia announced its withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation last year, signaling a broader reorientation of its international alliances.</p>

          <p>Multiple explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, Yolo County, California, ignited a large fire and have left seven people unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred at Devastating Pyrotechnics, prompted mandatory evacuations in a one-mile radius and caused several structures to catch fire, spreading to 80 acres of grass. While two injuries have been reported, officials are still working to determine the whereabouts of those missing. Residents described their homes shaking from the blasts, and power outages affected nearly 2,200 customers. An investigation led by Cal Fire is underway into the cause and circumstances.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are experiencing a robust resurgence, with new listing volumes jumping eightfold in the first half of the year to $14 billion, making it a leading global listing destination. This surge is fueled by a combination of factors, including supportive Beijing policies encouraging mainland companies to list offshore, a slower pace of A-share listings, and ample market liquidity. Additionally, fears of delisting from U.S. exchanges due to heightened U.S.-China tensions are prompting many Chinese firms to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. This trend reflects a strategic shift for Chinese companies seeking global expansion and alternative fundraising avenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, publicly demanding his immediate resignation on Truth Social. Trump's call follows a federal housing regulator's request for an investigation into Powell's testimony regarding renovations at the central bank's headquarters. Trump, who nominated Powell during his first term, has consistently criticized him for not lowering interest rates to boost economic growth. Powell previously stated that the Fed would have cut rates if not for Trump's tariff policies. The article notes that a President's authority to remove a Fed chair is legally contested.</p>

          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) revealed that Manchester City Council's heavy redaction of evidence significantly delayed investigations into historical child sexual assault cases. Some material provided by the council was so heavily redacted that it was impossible to assess its evidential value. The council defended its actions, citing complex rules on sharing personal data to prevent jeopardizing prosecutions. However, a new, more efficient information-sharing protocol has since been agreed upon, requiring investigators to view unredacted documents remotely. The force has also improved its approach to investigating child sexual exploitation.</p>

Key elements included DNA from a Q-tip found in his parents' trash, matching DNA on a knife sheath left at the crime scene. Surveillance footage and cell phone data also placed Kohberger's vehicle near the house multiple times. Investigators noted his apartment and car were meticulously cleaned post-murders. While the plea deal spares him the death penalty, it leaves questions about his motive and why he targeted the victims unanswered, though the evidence presented was compelling.</p>

          <p>A Pew Research Center study indicates that nearly 48% of Latino voters supported Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, a notable increase from 2020, challenging traditional political assumptions. Experts like Mike Madrid and Paola Ramos suggest this shift is driven by a perception that both major parties have failed the Latino community. Madrid points to backlash against permissive immigration policies among naturalized citizens, while Ramos highlights a "deep disillusionment" with Democratic promises. Both emphasize an underlying economic populism, suggesting Latino voters prioritize economic concerns and are responsive to clear, populist messages regardless of party.</p>

The extent of the damage is crucial, especially as the head of the UN nuclear watchdog warned Iran could produce enriched uranium in months.
