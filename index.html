Cruise has seemingly confirmed that The Final Reckoning would be the last instalment of the Mission Impossible franchise. Reviews for both films have been mixed, with some praising the action and adventure while others found the series risked going out with the "fizzled whimper of a message self-destructing in a tape deck."</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a contentious decision during their match at Old Trafford. The dispute centers around a disallowed goal due to an early whistle from the referee, preventing VAR intervention. Villa captain John McGinn criticized the decision, emphasizing its significant impact on the club's Champions League aspirations. Match of the Day pundits also agreed that the referee made an error by whistling too early, denying Villa a legitimate goal.</p>

          <p>President Trump has postponed the imposition of 50% tariffs on goods from the EU until July, as the two sides negotiate a trade deal. The decision follows a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested more time to reach a deal. Trump expressed that von der Leyen wants to engage in serious negotiations and work towards a resolution. The extension aims to allow for further discussions and potentially avert a trade war between the US and the EU.</p>
