        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has declared former President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the "subject to the jurisdiction" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, but the court disagreed with this interpretation. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy successfully avoided a technical recession by expanding 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations. The growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, economists caution that this pace may not be sustainable, as domestic consumption remains weak and global trade could soften. The positive data comes as South Korea navigates tense trade negotiations with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran golfer Lee Westwood has criticized the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) system, calling it a "mockery" for not including LIV Golf events. His comments came after he jumped over 3,700 spots in the rankings following a top-40 finish at The Open Championship, which highlighted the disparity for LIV players who only earn points at major tournaments. Westwood and other LIV golfers, like Tyrrell Hatton, argue that excluding their league's events prevents the world's best players from being accurately ranked and qualifying for majors. LIV Golf has submitted a new application for OWGR accreditation.</p>

          <p>The United States has secured new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which analysts view as an indirect strategy to counter China's influence by reshaping regional supply chains.

However, some experts suggest that the impact on China may be limited, as Chinese companies have been proactively localizing production within Southeast Asia.

          <p>This article details the horrifying reality for women in gang-controlled Port-au-Prince, Haiti, through the story of a 19-year-old survivor of sexual assault. Abducted and abused daily by gang members for months, she became pregnant and chose to keep her baby, who she now raises in a safe house. Her story is one of many, as sexual violence is used as a weapon to terrorize communities. The report highlights a surge in such attacks, with medical charities seeing patient numbers nearly triple, as Haiti's humanitarian and security crisis deepens amid widespread hunger and displacement.</p>

          <p>Market commentator Jim Cramer described the current stock market as a mixed environment, driven by both positive and negative forces. He pointed to constructive developments like the U.S.-Japan trade deal and strong earnings from some sectors, particularly in data center-related technology and healthcare. However, Cramer also warned of speculative "froth" in certain areas of the market, reminiscent of past bubbles, and cautioned investors to be skeptical but not cynical. He advised against leaving the market entirely, as there are still significant opportunities for profit in well-defined, successful themes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's vehicle manufacturing output in the first half of the year has fallen to its lowest point since 1953, not counting the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car production dropped by 7.3%, with van production plummeting by 45%. The decline is attributed to factors including uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to halt production. While the production of electric vehicles saw a slight increase, the overall figures highlight significant challenges for the British automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Freddie Freeman delivered a clutch two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Los Angeles Dodgers a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Minnesota Twins. The dramatic win saved the Dodgers from another bullpen collapse, which had wasted a stellar seven-inning, 12-strikeout performance by starter Tyler Glasnow. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team, but the article notes that the bullpen's recent struggles remain a significant issue. The Dodgers' relief pitchers have been heavily taxed this season due to an injury-plagued starting rotation.</p>

          <p>An expanded historical exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument has been removed, becoming the first known alteration following a Trump administration executive order to purge "unpatriotic" language from national parks. The "History Under Construction" exhibit, added in 2021, overlaid an existing sign to include more complex narratives, such as the role of Indigenous peoples and the racist views of some historical figures. Critics, including a former ranger who helped create it, argue the removal is an act of censorship that erases a more complete and nuanced version of American history to fit a political agenda.</p>

The utility plans to compensate those who lost homes, businesses, or suffered injuries, even though an official cause of the January blaze has not been determined. While Edison frames the program as a way to provide fair and prompt resolutions, some attorneys for fire victims expressed skepticism, suggesting it could be a tactic to underpay claimants.

Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the Justice Department's argument for release, based on public interest and transparency, did not meet the high legal standard required to overcome grand jury secrecy rules. This decision is a setback for the administration's effort to release more information about the case, an initiative launched after facing backlash from supporters.
