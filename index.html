          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. anticipates a significant decline in operating profit for the fiscal year ending in March, attributing this downturn to headwinds from a stronger yen and a projected $1.3 billion hit from President Trumpâ€™s tariffs imposed in April and May. The company's chief executive, Koji Sato, highlighted the extreme flux in the current environment surrounding the auto industry, including trade relations. This somber forecast underscores the challenges faced by many companies grappling with the impact of tariffs on global trade and economic stability, particularly for Japanese automakers exporting to the United States.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the renowned mystery novelist who passed away in 1976, has been digitally resurrected to teach an online writing course through BBC Maestro, employing artificial intelligence to create her likeness. The course utilizes a script crafted from her writings and archival interviews, with AI generating a "digital prosthetic" overlaid on a real actor's performance. While Christie's family supports the project, emphasizing that it uses her own words, ethicists raise concerns about posthumous representation and the potential for blurring the lines between fact and fiction, especially in the age of AI.</p>

The agreement, teased by Trump on social media, would be the first since the imposition of stiff tariffs on Americaâ€™s trading partners, which were later paused to facilitate trade negotiations. Discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as removing British taxes on U.S. technology companies, though it remains uncertain if the agreement has been finalized.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk, a key indicator of global trade, has revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast downwards, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from U.S.-China trade tariffs. Despite posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits, Maersk warns that current tariff levels could restrict global container market volumes. The company's CEO, Vincent Clerc, notes that the situation is primarily a China-U.S. issue and has not yet affected other trade lanes, but the potential for broader contamination remains a concern for the shipping industry.</p>

          <p>China's steel exports are projected to decline in the second quarter, potentially worsening a supply glut at home, as the trade war and increasing protectionism impact export markets. Analysts and traders forecast a drop of up to a fifth in second-quarter shipments from the world's largest steel producer and exporter, with expectations for further declines later in the year. Hit by Washington's tariffs and duties imposed by top customers, the reduction in exports could depress domestic prices, erode steelmaker profitability, and reduce their appetite for inputs like iron ore.</p>

The collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems, was unearthed in northern India nearly 130 years ago and was scheduled to be auctioned on May 7.</p>

          <p>With rising tensions between India and Pakistan, their military strengths are being compared, revealing India's position as a global defense giant versus Pakistan's heavy militarization despite economic challenges. India's defense spending reached Â£58 billion in 2024, while Pakistan's was estimated to be a tenth of that. India has 1.5 million active service personnel, and Pakistan has around 660,000. Both countries possess nuclear weapons, and even a small exchange could kill millions, underscoring the need for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Pakistan claims its air defense system shot down a dozen Indian drones overnight, with one drone attacking a military target near Lahore, causing damage and wounding soldiers. This follows Indian missile strikes on Pakistani locations that reportedly killed 31 civilians, raising fears of escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. India has evacuated thousands of people from villages near the militarized frontier in Kashmir. Tensions have risen since April 22, when gunmen killed 26 people in India-controlled Kashmir, an attack India blamed on Pakistan.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has sent a shiver through Britain's film industry, which is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes. With nearly 90 percent of film and high-end TV production spending in Britain coming from abroad, primarily the United States, the industry fears that such tariffs could wipe out recent progress. While it is unclear how the tariffs would be enforced, the uncertainty has prompted concerns about potential job losses and the long-term impact on the British film workforce.</p>
