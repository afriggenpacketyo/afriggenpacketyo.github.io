          <p>Science journalist and astrophysicist Adam Becker critiques the space colonization visions of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, arguing that Mars is an inhospitable and dangerous environment. Becker asserts that no terrestrial disaster could render Earth worse than Mars, labeling the idea of a Martian settlement a "delusion." He suggests that while robotic space exploration is valuable for science, humanity's focus should be on preserving and improving life on Earth, which he describes as the most special and amazing place in space. The article is based on an interview from the "Today, Explained" podcast.</p>

          <p>This article details the hazardous lives of "zama zamas," or artisanal coal miners, in South Africa's Mpumalanga province, who work in abandoned, dangerous mines due to poverty and unemployment. It follows Emmanuel Siyabonga, highlighting the risks of toxic gas, tunnel collapses, and violent clashes with authorities. The piece explores the complex situation where these miners provide essential fuel for local communities but are criminalized by the government, which fails to enforce mine rehabilitation laws or provide viable legal alternatives. The story underscores the legacy of industrial mining that has left communities impoverished and the environment damaged.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its eruptive activity, sending fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This latest event is part of an ongoing eruption series that began in December and poses no immediate threat to homes. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are monitoring the activity, explaining that magma buildup is causing periodic, forceful releases. For Native Hawaiians, the eruption is a culturally significant event connected to the volcano goddess Pele, drawing both reverence and increased tourism to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Utility bills across the United States are increasing, with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the past year, largely due to a surge in energy demand. Experts attribute this rise to the power-intensive needs of AI data centers, electrified transportation, and renewed economic activity, rather than a shift to renewables. The article explains that a lack of sufficient transmission infrastructure is a major bottleneck, preventing cheaper renewable energy from connecting to the grid. Policy decisions, including tariffs, equipment shortages, and support for fossil fuels, are also contributing to the higher costs faced by consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has notified lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant, of a potential deportation to Uganda following his release from a Tennessee jail. Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported to El Salvador over suspected MS-13 ties despite having protected status, was brought back to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. A judge released him into his brother's custody with electronic monitoring ahead of his trial.

          <p>Japan is actively broadening its defense collaborations, as evidenced by a recent multinational naval exercise where British and U.S. F-35B jets conducted operations from the Japanese warship JS Kaga. Analysts suggest this move is driven by a perception of mixed signals from the United States regarding its commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, prompting Japan to build a more diverse network of security partners. The joint training exercises, involving nations like the UK, Australia, Spain, and Norway, aim to enhance tactical integration and collective strength. This strategy reflects Tokyo's proactive approach to ensuring regional stability with an eye on China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>Applications for the T visa, a form of legal relief for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, have sharply increased in the United States. This visa allows survivors to remain in the country if they assist law enforcement, but they now face processing times that have jumped to nearly 20 months. While a new "bona fide determination" process grants earlier access to benefits, advocates express concern over policy changes that could lead to deportation if an application is denied. The rise in applications is attributed to greater awareness and mounting barriers to other forms of immigration relief like asylum.</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated ESPN docuseries about Colin Kaepernick's activism, directed by Spike Lee, has been canceled after three years in development. While creative differences were cited, with Lee focusing on police brutality and Kaepernick on his personal experience, the article suggests the project's delay pushed its potential release into a politically sensitive climate. The commentary posits that ESPN may have become hesitant to air a series critical of the Trump administration and featuring graphic police shooting footage, given the network's relationship with the NFL.

The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century Ghanaian-born scholar who became the first person of African descent to earn a European doctorate.

The map, pushed by former President Trump, aims to create five new districts that would likely elect Republicans, bolstering the party's chances of maintaining its House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. The approval came after a contentious process that included a weeks-long walkout by Democratic lawmakers in an attempt to block the vote.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the 27th season of "South Park" has successfully managed to satirize the second Trump administration, a feat many other comedy shows have struggled with. The author contends that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's aversion to "clapter" and their use of the show's unique, often harsh comedic language allows them to land effective blows without moralizing. By depicting Trump as a photo cutout with the same voice used for Saddam Hussein and portraying figures like Kristi Noem with spiteful caricature, the show avoids defanged impressions. The commentary suggests this approach makes the show's political commentary more potent and gratifyingly mean.</p>

          <p>The White House Rose Garden is undergoing a significant renovation directed by President Trump, with its central lawn being replaced by a stone patio. Trump stated the change was necessary because the grass became too soggy, causing women's high heels to sink. The new design, which cost $1.9 million covered by private donations, features paving stones similar in color to the White House and bears a resemblance to the patio at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. While the iconic flower beds and trees from the Kennedy-era design remain, the transformation of the lawn into a hardscaped event space marks another of Trump's personal modifications to the executive mansion.</p>

          <p>The market for high-end Puer tea, a fermented tea from Yunnan province long valued in China as a "drinkable antique" and an investment, is experiencing a significant downturn. Prices for premium Puer, once a speculative asset rivaling real estate, have plummeted to their lowest levels since 2019 as the investment bubble bursts. Analysts attribute the slump to China's broader economic slowdown, reduced corporate profits, and a government anti-corruption campaign that has curbed lavish gift-giving. The price collapse of this luxury good is seen as a reflection of waning investor appetite and tightening fiscal attitudes across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rail services in the UK are expected to face significant disruption over the bank holiday weekend due to a strike by RMT union members at the CrossCountry train operator. The strike will result in a reduced timetable, with no trains running on Saturday and a very limited service on Monday. The RMT union initiated the industrial action over disputes concerning staffing, safety, and pay agreements that it claims the company has failed to honor. CrossCountry has expressed disappointment and stated its commitment to further talks, while advising passengers to seek refunds or travel on alternative dates.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying between Texas and California, with significant implications for the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. After the Republican-led Texas legislature passed a new map to create five more GOP-favored seats, California's Democratic lawmakers responded with a plan to redraw their own map to add five Democratic seats, effectively canceling out the move. This article explains the process of gerrymandering, where district lines are drawn for partisan advantage, and notes the unusual nature of this mid-decade fight, which was spurred by former President Trump's call for Republicans to secure their majority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of a Las Vegas neighborhood are expressing frustration over massive and chronic illegal parking by members of the Hamere Noah Kidane Mihret & Saint Michael Ethiopian Orthodox Church. During a recent holiday ceremony, neighbors documented over 600 cars parked illegally, blocking roads and driveways despite "no parking" signs. Residents claim the issue, which includes speeding and running stop signs, has been ongoing for years without effective intervention from Clark County officials. The community is particularly concerned as the church is seeking county approval for an expansion, which they fear will exacerbate the strain on local infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) have developed a new military data link system designed for large-scale hypersonic combat. The system reportedly achieves time synchronization accuracy within five nanoseconds, a capability that is orders of magnitude more precise than NATO's current Link 16 system. This technological leap allows for real-time, secure coordination between multiple hypersonic platforms, ground control, and intelligence assets. Experts suggest this innovation could enable China to deploy coordinated swarms of hypersonic weapons with extreme precision, potentially creating a significant strategic advantage in high-speed warfare.</p>

After leaving school with no qualifications and quitting her job, she opened a small salon that initially struggled. Williams pivoted to offering online makeup classes and then developed her own product, an eyeshadow base that gained viral fame. The brand's explosive growth was further fueled by TikTok, where it broke UK sales records, demonstrating a remarkable journey from a council estate to international business success.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the key takeaways from the parole hearings that resulted in Erik and Lyle Menendez being denied release from prison. Despite support from more than a dozen family members, the parole board concluded that the brothers still pose a risk to public safety. The renewed public interest, fueled by a Netflix series and social media, has generated sympathy but did not sway the decision. The brothers' lawyers are pursuing a new trial based on recently discovered evidence of sexual assault, but their bid for freedom faces opposition from the new Los Angeles County District Attorney.</p>

          <p>Following an FBI raid on the home of former national security adviser John Bolton, Donald Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen offered blunt advice, stating Bolton needs to "lawyer up." Cohen, who experienced a similar raid in 2018, suggested the renewed investigation into whether Bolton's 2020 book contained classified information is a form of political retribution by the Trump administration. He predicted that Bolton would be indicted and that the raid is part of Trump's pattern of targeting his perceived enemies. Vice President JD Vance has dismissed claims of political motivation, while Trump himself made critical remarks about Bolton after the raid.</p>

Investigators with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department now believe that Emmanuel Haro is dead and that the kidnapping story was fabricated by his parents, Jake and Rebecca Haro. The search for the baby's body is ongoing. The case shifted after authorities noted inconsistencies in the mother's account of being attacked in a store parking lot. The father, Jake Haro, has a prior conviction for willful child cruelty, and another child was previously removed from the family's home.</p>

          <p>North Korea has lodged a protest, calling it a "serious provocation," after South Korean soldiers fired warning shots at the inter-Korean border. The incident occurred when North Korean troops briefly crossed the military demarcation line while working in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). South Korea's military stated that firing the warning shots was a standard defensive procedure, after which the Northern soldiers retreated without returning fire. A North Korean military official accused the South of deliberately escalating tensions, linking the action to ongoing joint U.S.-South Korean military drills in the region.</p>
