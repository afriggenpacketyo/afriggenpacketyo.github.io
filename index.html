          <p>The Trump administration has placed a Justice Department lawyer on leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in the case of a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported from Maryland. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the requirement for DOJ attorneys to "zealously advocate" for the U.S. Erez Reuveni, the acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, was placed on indefinite paid leave after admitting in court that the deportation was a mistake. The administration is appealing the judge's order to return the man to the U.S., arguing it lacks the power to force another country to act.</p>

          <p>The Midwest and South are bracing for more flash flooding after days of severe storms and deadly tornadoes.

Factors such as machismo, deprivation, and lack of health literacy play a role in these disparities. The strategy aims to improve access to healthcare and address the unique needs of men, particularly those in marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>A family has been awarded damages after a mother died from cervical cancer due to misreported screening results.

An internal review found the samples were inadequate but this information was not shared with Gleadell or her family.

          <p>Joe Joyce is facing questions about his boxing future after losing to Filip Hrgovic in Manchester. Hrgovic won by unanimous decision in a 10-round heavyweight bout. Joyce has now lost four of his last five fights, prompting his promoter to suggest he needs to seriously consider his future in the sport. Despite the loss, Joyce stated that he still has more to offer boxing, but his promoter believes he needs to have a "real serious think about the future".</p>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump, has stated that her business is "in danger of not recovering" after the president publicly criticized her work. Trump described the portrait as "truly the worst" and claimed it was "purposefully distorted." Boardman, who also painted a portrait of Barack Obama that Trump praised, said her intentions, integrity, and abilities have been called into question, negatively impacting her business of over 41 years. The portrait has since been removed from Colorado's State Capitol.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. While the IDF insists that at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, it has not provided any evidence and admits that they were unarmed when soldiers opened fire. The admission comes after mobile phone footage surfaced showing the vehicles had lights on and were clearly marked as ambulances, contradicting initial claims that they approached suspiciously in darkness.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered a strong performance in a 3-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies, showcasing glimpses of his future star potential. After two shaky starts, Sasaki held the Phillies to just one run over four-plus innings, demonstrating improved command and confidence. His fastball hit the right locations, setting up his signature splitter as a putaway weapon. The Dodgers' offense provided just enough support, with Kiké Hernández and Michael Conforto hitting home runs.</p>
