          <p>A stabbing incident at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, resulted in eleven people being wounded. The attack, which occurred near the store's checkout area, appeared to be random, according to the Grand Traverse County Sheriff. A suspect was taken into custody without injury, and a folding knife-style weapon was recovered from the scene. Five of the victims are reported to be in serious condition, while the other six are critical, and all are receiving treatment at a local medical center.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary investigates the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical movement in the UK formally known as the Jesus Fellowship. The film details widespread physical and sexual abuse that occurred within the group's communal homes over several decades. Interviews with over 80 survivors reveal lasting trauma and a culture of control and cover-up by the cult's leadership, including its late founder, Noel Stanton, who was accused in one disclosure of rape. The church disbanded in recent years, and a redress scheme has provided some compensation to hundreds of victims.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear incident during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members safely deplaned via emergency slides after smoke was seen billowing from under the aircraft. The airline later confirmed the issue was related to a tire, and the Denver Fire Department extinguished a small fire. Five people were evaluated for minor injuries at the scene, with one transported for further medical attention, and passengers were rebooked on a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced the resumption of humanitarian aid airdrops into Gaza and the establishment of humanitarian corridors for UN convoys. The move comes amid increasing international pressure and reports of rising starvation-related deaths, including dozens of children. Despite these efforts, UN agencies warn that airdrops are inefficient and insufficient to address the "man-made hunger," urging Israel to lift all restrictions on aid. The announcement coincided with reports of at least 53 Palestinians killed in recent Israeli strikes, highlighting the ongoing violence and catastrophic conditions in the territory.</p>

The diagnosis came as a relief, as a more severe injury could have resulted in a long-term absence for the star player. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 days to two weeks.

          <p>Ahead of the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain why watching high-stakes football matches can produce such strong physical and emotional reactions in fans. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, is activated as if the fan is participating in the game, leading to an increased heart rate and heightened senses. Experts advise fans to manage this stress by getting enough rest, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the nervous feelings as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for a rare and healthy expression of emotion.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s.

While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. Climatologists warn that despite the cold start, the Bay Area's hottest months are often September and October, so a heatwave is still possible.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to offer greater protection to pubs and live music venues from noise complaints made by residents of new nearby developments. Under the proposed changes, developers would be responsible for soundproofing new buildings, and processes for expanding outdoor areas would be streamlined. The government hopes these reforms will bring vibrancy back to struggling town centers and make it easier to open new hospitality businesses in disused shops. The move comes after several popular venues faced closure threats due to legal battles over noise levels.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a national recall effort, allowing them to retain their controlling majority in the legislature and continue the country's political gridlock. The campaign targeted 24 opposition lawmakers, accusing them of being "pro-China" and undermining national security. Since winning a parliamentary majority in early 2024, opposition parties have stymied the agenda of President William Lai's ruling party. The failure of the recall vote means the opposition is emboldened, and President Lai will likely face a hostile, opposition-controlled parliament until the end of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed how a "fantasist" and convicted fraudster named James Kenny orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival in Wales. The "Monmouth Rising" festival was billed as a 45,000-capacity event with headliners like The Killers and Pulp, but it was built on a foundation of lies. Kenny used forged documents and false claims of major investors and government backing to deceive employees and suppliers, many of whom lost money when the scheme collapsed. The investigation shows he never paid deposits for bands or applied for licenses, planning the entire multi-million pound event from his mother's kitchen.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for a fatal hate-crime attack, has died in custody. Czuba was convicted in February for the murder of 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and the attempted murder of his mother, Hanan Shaheen. The attack occurred in October 2023, days after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, with prosecutors arguing that Czuba targeted the family because they were Muslim. The case drew international attention and heightened fears of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hostility in the United States.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas from Burbank, California, performed an abrupt dive of several hundred feet to avoid a potential mid-air collision. Onboard alerts warned the pilots of another aircraft, a decommissioned fighter jet, in their vicinity shortly after takeoff. The rapid maneuver caused some unbelted passengers to fly out of their seats, though no serious injuries were reported among them. Two flight attendants sustained minor injuries, and the FAA has launched an investigation into the incident, which highlights ongoing concerns about air traffic control safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The broad tariff powers exercised by former President Donald Trump are facing a critical legal challenge in a federal appeals court. The lawsuit argues that Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs on various countries. A lower court previously struck down the tariffs, but the decision was paused pending appeal. If the courts ultimately rule against the administration, it could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs that have been central to Trump's economic policy, creating significant uncertainty for international trade.

During the visit, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic outreach is seen as a strategic move by New Delhi to counter Beijing's increasing influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England faces uncertainty over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes as they push for a victory on the final day of the fourth Test against India. After taking five wickets in the first innings and scoring a century, Stokes did not bowl on day four due to being "a bit stiff and sore," according to the team's assistant coach. Stokes, who has a history of injury issues, appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his availability to bowl. His absence from the attack would be a significant blow to England's chances of winning the crucial match.</p>

          <p>A CNN legal analyst expressed astonishment after former President Donald Trump gave a non-committal answer when asked if he would consider pardoning convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. When questioned, Trump stated, "It's something I haven't thought about," rather than issuing a firm denial. The analyst, Elie Honig, called it the "easiest question in human history" and said the only correct answer would be an absolute no. The exchange occurred amid increasing scrutiny of Trump's past association with Maxwell's accomplice, the late Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
