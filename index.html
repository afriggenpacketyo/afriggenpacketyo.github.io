          <p>Oracle's shares experienced a significant 27% jump in after-hours trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business. This investor enthusiasm came despite the company narrowly missing its quarterly earnings and revenue estimates. The growth is largely attributed to massive new AI-related contracts, including with OpenAI and Google, with Oracle forecasting its cloud revenue to potentially reach $144 billion in the coming years. CEO Safra Catz noted the company signed four multi-billion dollar contracts in the quarter, signaling strong future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, is being interpreted as a significant challenge to the Gulf nation's long-standing position as an indispensable international intermediary. For years, Qatar has balanced relationships with opposing factions, including the U.S., Iran, and various Islamist groups, making itself a crucial hub for negotiations. This attack, which Israel claims had U.S. consent, suggests that major powers may now view Qatar's mediation efforts in the Gaza conflict as a hindrance rather than a help. The event questions the viability of Qatar's diplomatic strategy and its relevance in a conflict where negotiation seems increasingly futile.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Coalition for Human Rights in Development alleges that Germany's state-backed KfW, the world's largest development bank, is linked to significant human rights abuses and environmental damage through its global projects. The report details instances of forced relocations of Indigenous communities in countries like Indonesia and Kenya without proper consent or compensation. It also highlights environmental harm from projects in Europe and criticizes the bank's complaint procedures as opaque and inaccessible. The coalition is urging KfW to implement an independent accountability mechanism to prevent such harms in the future.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on a lower court's order that would have compelled the Trump administration to spend nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds. President Trump had previously informed Congress he would not spend the appropriated money, calling it "woke, weaponized and wasteful," in a move known as a "pocket rescission." A federal judge had ordered the administration to release the funds, which were designated for UN organizations, peacekeeping, and democracy projects. Chief Justice John Roberts' order pauses this mandate while the court considers the administration's appeal.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have approved a groundbreaking vaccine designed to protect the nation's endangered koala population from a devastating chlamydia epidemic. Developed by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast over more than a decade, the single-dose vaccine has been shown to reduce disease symptoms and decrease mortality by at least 65% in wild populations. Chlamydia is a leading cause of death for koalas, causing blindness, infertility, and painful infections, with some colonies seeing infection rates as high as 70%.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has informed government departments that access to the Treasury's £9 billion emergency reserve fund will be significantly restricted ahead of the November budget. In a letter to ministers, she stated that the reserve, intended for unforeseen and unavoidable pressures, will only be available to departments that have maximized their own savings first. This move aims to enforce fiscal discipline, reduce government borrowing, and keep spending within established limits. The decision comes as the Labour government faces pressure to stimulate economic growth while managing public finances responsibly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed an AI model named SpikingBrain 1.0 that mimics the human brain's efficiency by activating only necessary neurons. This "brain-like" design reportedly allows the model to run up to 100 times faster than conventional systems on certain long-text tasks while requiring less than 2% of the typical training data. Significantly, the system operates entirely on China's domestic MetaX chip platform, bypassing the need for Nvidia hardware. This development represents a strategic advance for China's AI ecosystem amid U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on Tuesday targeted senior Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, resulting in the deaths of six people, including a Qatari security official, though the primary targets reportedly survived. The attack involved 15 Israeli fighter jets striking a residential complex where Hamas's negotiating delegation was located. Israel described it as a "precise strike" against those responsible for the October 7th attacks, while Qatar condemned it as a reckless violation of international law. The White House confirmed it was informed of the operation but stated it was an independent Israeli decision, creating diplomatic tensions with Qatar, a key U.S. ally.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the legality of the Trump administration's extensive global tariffs, scheduling arguments for an expedited hearing in November. The case challenges President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad levies, a move lower courts have ruled exceeded his authority. This will be the first major test of the president's signature economic policy before the high court. A ruling against the administration could force the U.S. to refund billions of dollars in collected tariffs and potentially disrupt existing and future trade agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, it focuses on overhauling the vaccine injury system, increasing oversight of psychiatric prescriptions for children, and promoting new research.

          <p>Following intense customer criticism, Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its plans to remodel its restaurants with a more contemporary design. This decision comes just weeks after the company reversed a controversial change to a new, minimalist logo that had sparked outrage from conservatives who accused the chain of going "woke." The company stated it heard "clearly that the modern remodel design does not reflect what you love about Cracker Barrel." It assured customers that the familiar "vintage Americana" aesthetic, including rocking chairs and fireplaces, would remain.</p>

          <p>The trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has seen two of the five presiding Supreme Court justices vote to find him guilty of plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss. A conviction requires at least one more guilty vote from the remaining three justices. Justice Alexandre de Moraes stated there was "no doubt" of a coup attempt led by Bolsonaro, while Justice Flávio Dino also found him guilty on all charges. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face over 40 years in prison for his alleged role in trying to prevent his successor from taking office.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned amid widespread, violent protests led by the country's youth, who identify as "Gen Z." The demonstrations were initially sparked by a since-revoked government ban on numerous social media platforms but quickly evolved to voice deep-rooted anger over alleged government corruption. The protests have seen at least 22 people killed in clashes with police, and demonstrators have set fire to government buildings. The youth-led movement has used social media to organize and highlight the lavish lifestyles of political elites in contrast to the struggles of ordinary citizens.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu as the country's new prime minister following the collapse of the previous government. Lecornu, a 39-year-old Macron loyalist, becomes France's fourth prime minister in just over a year. His immediate task is to negotiate a national budget with France's fractured political parties, a challenge that led to his predecessor's ouster in a no-confidence vote. Macron has instructed Lecornu to secure a budget agreement before formally assembling a new government, signaling a desperate need for political and institutional stability.</p>

          <p>Police in Pierce County, Washington, have arrested a 13-year-old boy who they say had "everything ready to go to commit a mass shooting." A SWAT team discovered a cache of 23 firearms, ammunition, and writings with "school shooter ideations" in the boy's home. The arrest followed a tip from an internet watch group about threatening online posts. Many of the firearms lacked serial numbers, and some appeared to be homemade using a 3D printer. The boy has pleaded not guilty to several charges and is being held in a juvenile detention center.</p>

          <p>The Italian journalist who directed a question about the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements only to Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield, excluding their Black co-star Ayo Edebiri, has responded to the ensuing controversy. In a statement, Federica Polidoro defended her actions, claiming she has been a victim of "cyberbullying" and that "real racists are those who see racism everywhere." During the press event, Edebiri interjected to state that the work of these movements is "not finished at all." Polidoro argued that journalism's role is to ask "uncomfortable" questions and that her inquiry was being unfairly criticized.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a federal charge against Decarlos Brown Jr., the man accused of fatally stabbing 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina. The charge of causing death on a mass transportation system makes the suspect eligible for the death penalty. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated her office will seek the maximum penalty for the "horrific murder," which has become a focal point in the national debate over crime. Zarutska had fled the war in Ukraine with her family in 2022.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its air campaign against Ukraine, launching larger and more frequent strikes that are hitting targets deep within the country, including a government building in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials identified the weapon used in the Kyiv attack as an Iskander cruise missile. Simultaneously, a Russian glide bomb killed more than 20 civilians queuing for their pensions in the eastern Donbas region. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks as "savage" and reiterated his urgent plea for more advanced air defense systems, as Russia increasingly uses hundreds of drones at a time to overwhelm Ukraine's defenses.</p>
