          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced a boost as the Trump administration prepared to roll back the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. A Department of Commerce spokesperson stated the rule was overly complex and would hinder American innovation, while Nvidia welcomed the administration's new direction on AI policy, stating it would create a once-in-a-generation opportunity for America to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD's CEO also supported the decision, emphasizing the need to balance national security with the industry's growth.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated following Indian missile strikes into Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistani territory, which India claimed targeted militant infrastructure linked to a recent tourist massacre. Pakistan responded with retaliatory measures, including shooting down several Indian aircraft. The strikes and counterattacks have resulted in numerous casualties on both sides, prompting security exercises and civil defense drills in India, and airport closures in Pakistan. International reactions have been swift, with the U.N. calling for maximum restraint and President Trump offering to mediate between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a House hearing focusing on colleges beyond the Ivy League, presidents from Haverford College, DePaul University, and California Polytechnic State University faced scrutiny regarding their handling of antisemitism on campus. Three college presidents apologized for not acting more aggressively to curb antisemitism on their campuses during a House committee hearing on Wednesday, in what Republicans billed as an effort to examine colleges beyond the Ivy League. Republican lawmakers threatened to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools, while Democrats accused Republicans of using antisemitism as a political weapon. The hearing reflected ongoing tensions between higher education and the federal government regarding campus protests and accusations of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is facing a lawsuit from investors alleging that the company misled them by withholding information about the impact of public backlash following the death of CEO Brian Thompson and concerns over high claim denials.

The complaint describes UnitedHealthcare's strategy as "aggressive, anti-consumer tactics" which became increasingly controversial after Thompson's death.

          <p>House Republicans are facing challenges in passing their plan to renew tax cuts and slash spending, dubbed the 'big, beautiful bill.' The debate centers on key provisions such as the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, President Trump's demands for no tax on tips or overtime, and cuts to entitlement programs like Medicaid. Democrats argue that Republicans are manipulating figures to cover the cost of tax breaks, while Republicans insist on eliminating waste and fraud. The bill also includes a major hike in the debt ceiling, with the Treasury Secretary warning of an approaching 'X date' when the government will exhaust its ability to cover obligations.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs, as it assesses the economic impact of his trade policies. The Fed signaled rising economic risks, with concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could spur both higher inflation and unemployment. The central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach due to the uncertainty of the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies. Wall Street interpreted the comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom requested collaboration on a federal film tax credit to "Make America Film Again." Newsom's proposal followed Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S. Trump claimed the American film industry has been "decimated" by other countries and Newsom's "gross incompetence." He also criticized the California High-Speed Rail project, while acknowledging a good relationship with Newsom. The president vowed to meet with film industry executives to ensure they're happy with the prospective tariffs.</p>

          <p>The 2024-25 influenza season resulted in 25 pediatric deaths in New York State, the highest in recent years, amid declining vaccination rates. The CDC estimates that over 47 million people nationwide contracted the flu, with hospitalization rates at a 15-year high. Factors contributing to the heavy toll include a decrease in flu vaccinations and the circulation of more intense strains. Misinformation around vaccines has contributed to rising vaccine hesitancy and declining vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>Economists are turning to alternative data sources to gauge the economic impact of President Trump's trade wars, as mainstream measures have been slow to reflect the effects of tariffs and uncertainty. Americans are spending less at McDonald’s, fewer container ships are expected at the Port of Los Angeles, and Procter & Gamble is raising prices. The Federal Reserve is also monitoring these nonconventional indicators as it sets monetary policy. Economists disagree about how tariffs will manifest, whether through higher prices, product shortages, or layoffs, creating challenges for forecasting and policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Columbia University's main library, renaming it "the Basel Al-Araj Popular University" and demanding the university divest from funds profiting from Israeli actions. The protest occurred amid a crackdown by the Trump administration, which has accused Columbia of failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitism and cut federal funding. The university requested NYPD assistance to secure the building after protesters refused to identify themselves and disperse, and a crowd outside created a safety hazard. The demonstration threatened to complicate ongoing negotiations between the Trump administration and Columbia officials seeking the restoration of federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to eliminate the EPA's Energy Star offices, potentially ending the decades-old program that helps consumers choose energy-efficient products. The changes are part of a broader reorganization at the EPA, reflecting the administration's shift away from climate change initiatives. The Energy Star program has reduced energy costs by over $500 billion and prevented significant greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that cutting the program will make it harder for consumers to access trustworthy information about energy use and undermine efforts to meet U.S. energy demands.</p>

The defeat means Arsenal will end the season without winning a trophy for the fourth season in a row, after Arteta led them to an FA Cup triumph in 2020 during his first season in charge.
