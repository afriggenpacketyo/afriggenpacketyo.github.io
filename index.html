          <p>Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris stated that the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is unlikely to pass in the House on Wednesday due to disagreements among conservatives regarding Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Harris mentioned that negotiations are ongoing, but the bill worsened overnight, making a deal improbable for the day. House Republicans are working to push the megabill through a key committee, aiming to advance President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, but face division within the conference. The bill includes changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration plans to discontinue Biden-era police reform initiatives in cities facing controversy over police killings and brutality. The Justice Department will dismiss oversight agreements with police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Missouri, and will halt investigations into police constitutional violations in cities like Phoenix and Memphis. This decision occurs shortly before the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, which sparked widespread protests against police brutality. The Trump administration believes these reforms unduly handcuff local leaders and police departments.</p>

          <p>The inquest into the death of Jay Slater, who went missing in Tenerife, was adjourned after his mother requested key witnesses to events before his death be located. Slater's body was found with severe head injuries, consistent with a fall from height, after he went missing in June 2024. Toxicology reports indicated he had been under the influence of drugs and alcohol. His mother expressed a desire to question those who last saw him, leading to the adjournment.

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that Russia has been using Brazil as a launchpad for its most elite intelligence officers, known as 'illegals,' who establish new identities to later operate in the United States, Europe, or the Middle East. These spies assimilate into Brazilian society by starting businesses, making friends, and having love affairs to build credible backstories. A Brazilian counterintelligence team has been working to dismantle this spy network, with assistance from intelligence agencies in the United States, Israel, and other Western countries. The operation, known as Operation East, has uncovered at least nine Russian officers operating under Brazilian cover identities, dealing a significant blow to Moscowâ€™s espionage program.</p>

          <p>An unexpected rise in inflation, reaching 3.5% in April, suggests a potentially gloomier economic outlook than previously anticipated. Higher energy and water bills, along with rising food and service prices, have contributed to this increase, outpacing inflation rates in France and Germany. While some factors, like airfare spikes due to late Easter holidays, are temporary, persistent price pressures in services like restaurant meals concern the Bank of England. Economists predict that inflation may inch up further in the coming months, potentially impacting interest rate decisions and homeowners looking to remortgage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Military strikes in Yemen by the United States and Israel, along with sanctions targeting the Houthi militia, have worsened the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East's poorest country. These strikes, aimed at degrading the Houthis' economic power and military capabilities, have killed civilians, destroyed infrastructure, and increased uncertainty. The Houthis, who control much of Yemen, have been attacking Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, prompting retaliatory actions. Aid workers and analysts warn that these actions will exacerbate the already dire conditions for Yemeni civilians, leading to fuel crises and increased costs for basic goods.</p>
