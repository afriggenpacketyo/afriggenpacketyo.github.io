          <p>Huawei reported a significant 22.4% year-on-year revenue increase in 2024, reaching nearly a record high of $118.2 billion.  This surge is attributed to a comeback in the Chinese smartphone market and growth in its core telecommunications business, despite ongoing US sanctions restricting access to key technologies. However, net profit declined by 28%, potentially indicating that increased investment is outweighing immediate returns. The article may downplay the long-term effects of the sanctions on Huawei's sustainability.</p>
