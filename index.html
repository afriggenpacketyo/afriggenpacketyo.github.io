          <p>Following the death of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's most prominent accusers, her family is publicly calling for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations he sexually abused her. In an interview, her brother stated that Prince Andrew being stripped of royal duties was insufficient and that he should be held to the fullest extent of the law. The family feels there has not been adequate accountability for the prince's alleged involvement in the Epstein scandal.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that America's tipping culture is a flawed system that should be eliminated in favor of paying workers a stable living wage. The author contends that the new "no tax on tips" law, while seemingly beneficial to workers, only serves to further entrench this precarious system. Instead of creating complex tax incentives, the article suggests the U.S. should adopt the practice of many other countries by requiring employers to provide fair, predictable compensation without relying on customer gratuities.</p>

          <p>Jon Green, the chair of the Johnson County Board of Supervisors in Iowa, has announced he will not comply with the governor's order to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While condemning the killing, Green stated he would not bestow county honors upon a figure he says dedicated his career to denigrating marginalized communities and degrading political discourse. The decision has ignited a debate over how to officially mourn divisive public figures.</p>

          <p>Swiss bank UBS is reportedly considering moving its headquarters to the United States to avoid stricter capital requirement proposals from the Swiss government. Following its government-brokered takeover of Credit Suisse, regulators have proposed rules that could force UBS to hold billions more in capital. According to reports, senior executives have met with U.S. officials to discuss a potential strategy shift, which could have significant implications for the global financial landscape.

          <p>A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has found that the 16-year-old who carried out a recent shooting at a Colorado high school was an active user of a "violent gore" website known for extremist content. The ADL highlighted that this is part of a disturbing trend, as several other perpetrators of recent school shootings have also frequented the same site. The findings underscore the role that online radicalization and extremist communities play in fostering real-world violence.</p>

          <p>This commentary by Moira Donegan argues that while the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a tragedy and political violence is unacceptable, the public should resist rewriting his history. The author contends that many postmortem tributes have dishonestly sanitized Kirk's legacy, ignoring his career of spreading hateful and divisive rhetoric against marginalized groups. The piece asserts that an honest accounting of his impact is essential and does not diminish the condemnation of his murder.</p>

          <p>This analytical commentary posits that Israeli society is largely insulated from the realities of the war in Gaza, existing in a "permanent present" without a viable vision for a future peace. The author argues that the traditional peace process has failed because it did not treat Palestinian rights as a precondition. The piece suggests that decisive international actions, such as widespread recognition of a Palestinian state, are necessary to break the current political stalemate and challenge Israeli impunity.</p>

Many undocumented residents now face the difficult choice between going to work and risking deportation, or staying home and facing potential eviction.

          <p>The Trump administration's "Make Our Children Healthy Again" report is facing criticism from health advocates for its significant omission of smoking, vaping, and nicotine as major health risks for children. While the report addresses other issues, its failure to mention tobacco, the leading cause of preventable death, is being called a major public health oversight. Critics, including parents whose children have suffered from vaping-related lung injuries, are horrified by the exclusion of substance usage from the strategy.</p>
