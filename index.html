          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults shares five rules for parents navigating the complexities of child-rearing in the modern age. The advice emphasizes trusting parental instincts and cultural traditions over influencer trends and clickbait. Parents are encouraged to focus on their child's individual interests and foster enjoyment in activities rather than obsessing over developmental milestones. The article concludes by urging parents to be authentic and provide love and attention, as perfection is unattainable and genuine emotional expression is crucial for children's development. The psychiatrist argues that every generation has faced unique parenting challenges, and this one is no different. </p>

          <p>Many job seekers are experiencing a phenomenon dubbed the "Glass Wall," where numerous job postings are visible, but applications seem to disappear without response. A marketing professional in Chicago, who has sent over 1,000 applications, coined the term to describe the feeling of being unable to break through to recruiters and hiring managers. Experts recommend networking, leveraging referrals, and tailoring applications to specific roles to overcome this challenge. The experience highlights the disconnect between the apparent availability of jobs and the difficulty in securing interviews in the current job market. </p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of an "imminent" threat from China towards Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter potential conflict. Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth characterized China's actions as seeking regional dominance and highlighted its military preparations for potentially altering the balance of power in Asia. In response, the Chinese embassy in Singapore accused the US of being the primary instigator of regional instability, citing US military deployments and reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea. Hegseth's speech underscored the US commitment to its Asian allies and the need for a strong deterrent against Chinese aggression. </p>

          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog indicates that Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a level that is a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The IAEA report raised concerns, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material.

The arrests are part of a fifth wave of actions against the government's political opponents, which began with the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Imamoglu, who is regarded as President Tayyip Erdogan's main rival, sent a letter from prison condemning the arrests as unjust and unlawful. The UN's human rights office has expressed concern over the mass arrests, while Amnesty International has called the detentions draconian. </p>

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed a tumor on a woman's spine through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. The patient, who had been experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, and during an MRI, doctors discovered a second chordoma on her spine. The surgeons developed a unique surgical plan, called the "third nostril" approach, practicing the technique for weeks before the 20-hour procedure. The patient is now cancer-free and recovering, with doctors hoping the procedure can be used for other difficult-to-reach tumors. </p>

This has slowed research as scientists investigate the cause of the hives, and the anti-vaccine stance of the current administration has created a culture of fear among scientists. The Department of Health and Human Services has terminated funding for hundreds of research projects related to HIV and vaccines, including Moderna's mRNA-based flu vaccine development. This has led to the termination of partnerships with NIH scientists and a reluctance among researchers to publicly discuss mRNA vaccines for fear of losing funding. </p>

The educator suggests that AI can be a valuable tool for learning if students ask follow-up questions to understand how chatbots arrive at their conclusions. Experts recommend using AI for tasks that don't involve the final product, such as creating outlines, and always double-checking its factual claims. The educator's research indicates that students who used AI to practice writing cover letters produced stronger letters on their own. </p>

          <p>Abdullah Ibhais, a former 2022 World Cup worker, seeks to sue Qatar's Supreme Committee and Fifa for negligence after serving three years in a Doha jail. He alleges he was targeted for investigating worker's rights complaints and now wants to hold both organizations accountable. Ibhais describes his experience as a prism for the story of the World Cup, involving migrant workers, media coverage, and Qatar's public image. He aims to pursue legal action in Switzerland, the US, or any country with jurisdiction over Fifa. </p>

          <p>The Army is preparing to involuntarily separate transgender troops from the military, according to internal documents. The guidance instructs personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth rather than their preferred pronouns. Soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria based on criteria such as past requests for grooming standard exemptions or overt conduct of gender identity differing from assigned sex at birth. The move has been criticized as worse than the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, overtly targeting transgender service members. </p>

China's army "is rehearsing for the real deal," Hegseth said, adding that the threat China poses is real and could be imminent.
