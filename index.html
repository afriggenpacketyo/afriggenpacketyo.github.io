        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices experienced a fourth consecutive month of decline in May, primarily due to sluggish demand and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The National Bureau of Statistics reported a 0.1% year-on-year drop in the consumer price index (CPI), slightly better than market expectations. Despite government efforts to boost consumption and improve supply-demand relationships, deflationary pressures persist, particularly with declining energy prices. A new round of trade talks between China and the United States is scheduled to take place in London, aiming to address these economic challenges. Optimism regarding China's economic outlook remains tempered due to these persistent deflationary risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing significant unrest following Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to widespread protests and the deployment of National Guard troops. Demonstrations erupted after ICE officers executed search warrants, resulting in clashes between protesters and law enforcement. President Trump ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as an overreach of federal authority. The protests have raised concerns about immigration policies and the use of federal resources in local law enforcement matters, with various officials and community members expressing strong opinions on the situation.</p>

          <p>A team at Beihang University in Beijing, led by Professor Li Hongge, has achieved a breakthrough by starting mass production of the world’s first non-binary AI chip. This innovation overcomes the power wall and architecture wall challenges faced by traditional binary systems by merging binary and stochastic logic. The new Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system enhances fault tolerance and power efficiency, making it suitable for intelligent control applications such as touch displays and flight systems. This development allows China to sidestep some US chip restrictions and represents a significant advancement in AI chip technology.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating that Beijing's stimulus measures are not sufficiently boosting domestic consumption. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while deflation in factory-gate prices deepened, falling 3.3%. In response, Chinese financial regulators have implemented policy steps, including interest rate cuts and lowering the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster the economy. Trade tensions with the U.S. and uncertainties regarding trade agreements continue to impact market sentiment, prompting anticipation for further monetary easing measures from Beijing.

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles, specifically in Paramount, following rumors of an immigration raid at a hardware store, leading to clashes between protesters and authorities.

The unrest resulted in violence, with rocks and Molotov cocktails thrown, prompting authorities to use pepper spray, rubber bullets, and smoke bombs to subdue the crowd. President Trump deployed the California National Guard in response to the protests, further escalating tensions in the city.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in conflict over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, centering on differing interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump deployed the National Guard in response to attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, asserting the need to address lawlessness. Newsom, however, objected to the deployment, arguing it was an unlawful breach of state sovereignty and inflamed tensions. The Posse Comitatus Act generally bars the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist under certain conditions, leading to a legal and political dispute between the federal and state governments.</p>

          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the possibility of further industrial action looming. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed the award as "grotesque" and says the vote will be crucial in determining the next steps, which could include a ballot for strike action. The vote is being billed as the biggest single vote by the profession ever launched in the UK, highlighting the ongoing pay dispute and its potential impact on the NHS. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action over pay, adding to the tensions.</p>

Companies like Ocean Winds receive payments for turning down output from wind farms because the system cannot handle the electricity generated.

The government is considering a radical solution of smaller regional markets to improve efficiency and lower bills, but the proposal has sparked debate within the energy industry and raised concerns about potential cost increases for some consumers.
