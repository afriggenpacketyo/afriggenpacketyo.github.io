          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has suspended online orders and is issuing refunds to customers after a cyberattack disrupted its systems. Customers reported issues with contactless payments, Click & Collect, and gift card usage, leading to the complete pause of online and app-based shopping, including food deliveries. The retailer's shares initially fell by 5% after the announcement, although they later recovered. M&S has apologized for the inconvenience and is working with cyber experts to restore online services, while stores remain open. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced negotiations in Oman to address Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment limitations in exchange for easing economic sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin before arriving in Oman for the talks, which aim to de-escalate tensions following Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. Trump indicated a preference for a deal but did not rule out military action if negotiations fail. Iran insists on maintaining its enrichment capabilities. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he will not reduce tariffs on China unless the country provides something "substantial" in return. During a press gaggle on Air Force One, Trump emphasized that he wants China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products, allowing them to freely sell their goods within China. He expressed a desire for an agreement similar to one that was previously negotiated but later abandoned by China. Trump's stance indicates a continued focus on trade negotiations and a demand for significant concessions from China to reduce tariffs. Optimism score: 40</p>

While formal meetings are unlikely out of respect for the solemn occasion, diplomats anticipate "brush-by" conversations on the sidelines of the ceremony. Attention is focused on potential discussions between Presidents Trump and Zelensky regarding the conflict in Ukraine, despite tensions between the two leaders.

          <p>President Donald Trump's actions against the media, including barring reporters, attempting to defund public broadcasters, and signing executive orders targeting law firms, are testing the limits of US press freedom. While some outlets have successfully fought back in court, experts warn that the First Amendment requires active defense. Trump's moves are seen as part of a broader strategy to control the public narrative, potentially leading to increased misinformation and threatening democratic stability. Some fear that lawyers may be intimidated from challenging the Trump administration, further eroding press freedom. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, shortly after he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax crimes. Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, was involved in efforts to publicize Ashley Biden's diary during the 2020 presidential campaign. Fago, a Republican donor, was contacted by someone possessing the diary, which detailed Ashley Biden's recovery from addiction. The pardon came less than two weeks after Walczak was ordered to pay nearly $4.4 million in restitution. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has expressed concern over the deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras by the Trump administration. Judge Terry A.
