            <p>Following US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's comments regarding China's potential threat to the Panama Canal, China has strongly refuted these claims. Hegseth alluded to the control of ports at either end of the canal by a Hong Kong consortium, suggesting it could allow China to conduct surveillance. The Chinese embassy in Panama condemned the US, accusing it of using 'blackmail' and interfering with Panama's sovereign decisions. The situation is further complicated by ongoing tensions over canal usage fees and allegations of Chinese influence, which Panama denies.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration permission to resume deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, clarifying that those facing removal are entitled to judicial review.

The ruling comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, and allows deportations to resume while legal proceedings continue, but the detainees must be notified of their right to challenge the deportation.</p>

Government data supports Musk's assertion, with Tesla's Model 3 Long Range sourcing 75% of its parts from the US or Canada.

            <p>The U.S. Army is exploring options to enhance its 250th birthday celebration in June, possibly including demonstrations and vehicle displays on the National Mall. This has ignited speculation about a military parade, reminiscent of President Trump's previous desire for a grand military display. The Army is planning multiple events leading up to June 14. City officials have been approached about a parade route, though concerns exist regarding infrastructure impact.</p>

            <p>Wednesday's newspaper front pages are dominated by Prince Harry's legal challenge regarding his UK security arrangements and escalating concerns about a global trade war triggered by Trump's tariffs. Many newspapers highlighted the royal family's estrangement. Other stories include Elon Musk's public spat with a Trump advisor and a story on London falling out of top five wealthiest cities as millionaires leave the capital.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk has escalated his attacks on Peter Navarro, criticizing his views on trade and manufacturing, as Tesla's stock price continues to decline. Musk's attacks on Navarro represent the most public spat between members of Trump's inner circle since the president took office in January, and show that the steep tariffs Trump announced Wednesday on more than 180 countries and territories don't have universal approval in the administration. Musk's younger brother, Kimbal — a restaurant owner, entrepreneur and Tesla board member — has joined in on the action.</p>

            <p>Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice expressed excitement after scoring two free-kicks against Real Madrid in the Champions League. Rice said that he saw the space around the Madrid wall for the first goal and told Saka he was confident. Alan Shearer said it was "absolutely incredible" and former Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf said "not even Superman would get it". For Rice this was his biggest moment so far in an Arsenal shirt, but Arteta and midfielder Mikel Merino - who scored the third goal - were not surprised by how the former West Ham man stood up.</p>

Hampton has six clean sheets in 13 caps, has been selected in three of England's four Women's Nations League matches, including the win over world champions Spain.</p>

Investors won't feel confident again until the pace slows and there's more thought to the actions taken, Cramer said. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's actions regarding deportations and immigration are raising concerns about due process, especially considering President Trump's own extensive use of due process protections. The Supreme Court allowed deportations of alleged gang members to resume, while Chief Justice Roberts temporarily lifted an order to return a wrongly deported man to the US. The administration's attempt to deny due process is especially galling because the man who leads it has benefited from—some might say exploited—his own right to due process so extensively and so recently.</p>

            <p>Amidst global market turmoil caused by his tariffs, President Trump is focusing on China, oscillating between confrontational and conciliatory messages. A day of dizzying geopolitical swings ended with the White House announcing that additional 50 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports would go into effect on Wednesday. The muscle-flexing came as Trump’s lieutenants tried to frame the administration’s rapid shifts about its tariffs programme as consistent and likely to produce its stated goals of boosting US manufacturing, generating “trillions of dollars in revenue” and spurring US economic prosperity.</p>
