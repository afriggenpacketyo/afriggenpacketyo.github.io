          <p>President Trump is cutting his G7 trip short and returning to Washington due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump affirmed that he had spoken with various parties regarding the situation and was aware of messages from Iran indicating a desire to de-escalate. He urged Iran to negotiate before it's too late, while also mentioning Israel's strong position in the conflict. This decision follows increasing airstrikes and missile attacks between Israel and Iran, with the U.S. maintaining it is not directly involved in Israel's strikes but has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing violence and uncertainty surrounding potential negotiations.</p>

          <p>A coalition of press rights organizations is suing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) over alleged abuses against journalists during protests related to President Trump's immigration policies. The lawsuit cites instances of officers firing foam projectiles at journalists, using tear gas, and detaining them without cause, violating state laws protecting journalists covering unrest. Civil rights attorney Carol Sobel argues that LAPD officers have been blocking journalists from areas where they have a right to be, in violation of department rules and state law.

Officials in these cities expressed disappointment and concern over the loss of federal support, which is crucial for implementing infrastructure improvements to protect residents from storm damage.

          <p>Zhang Chaoyang, a pioneer of the Chinese internet, advises students to bypass graduate school and postpone start-up plans. Citing his own experience, Zhang suggested that college graduates should first gain experience working at a company before starting their own businesses. Zhang founded Internet Technologies China in 1996, which became the first mainland internet company to raise venture capital funding and later became Sohu.com. He believes practical experience is more valuable than advanced degrees for entrepreneurs.</p>

Experts believe the incident also reflects a shift in propaganda strategy, where the regime acknowledges problems to demonstrate accountability and competence.
