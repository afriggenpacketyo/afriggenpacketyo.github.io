          <p>Tundu Lissu, Tanzania's main opposition leader, is facing a treason trial that his party claims is politically motivated, stemming from his campaign for electoral reforms before the October elections. Despite being barred from running, Lissu expressed confidence before the hearing. The trial has drawn condemnation from international bodies like the International Democratic Union and the International Commission of Jurists, who criticize the government's actions against the opposition. Human rights activists accuse President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government of silencing critics, while the government denies these claims, but Lissu's case remains a significant test for democracy in Tanzania. The trial is ongoing and is being closely watched by international observers.</p>

The public has expressed anger and disappointment, with many calling him out of touch with the struggles of ordinary citizens who are facing increasing food costs.

          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union are meeting in London to announce a freshly struck deal aimed at strengthening trade and defense relationships, marking a major reset of post-Brexit relations. The summit addresses how Europe and Britain are reorienting themselves in a world where America is a less reliable ally on defense and trade. A new defense and security partnership is expected, outlining future military cooperation, along with an agreement on fishing access and collaboration on geopolitical issues. The deal includes extending access to U.K. fishing waters for European boats until June 30, 2038 and a youth mobility program, facilitating work, study, and travel for young people between the U.K. and EU.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has rescinded a $37.7 million fine against Grand Canyon University for alleged deceptive practices, a decision welcomed by university president Brian Mueller. The fine, initially imposed in October 2023, was based on claims that doctoral students incurred additional costs due to extra courses. Mueller had accused the federal government of targeting Christian universities, noting a similar fine threatened against Liberty University. The department's move ends a years-long legal battle for Grand Canyon University, which maintains its commitment to transparency and best practices in higher education.</p>

While advocates welcome the developments as the U.S. taking a global leadership role in finance, critics warn of potential risks to average Americans and the possibility of a financial crisis.

          <p>The Trump administration is pulling back Medicaid funding for social services like housing and nutrition, reversing an expansion initiated during his first term and continued by the Biden administration. This shift has created chaos in states that have invested in these programs, as officials argue that Medicaid should focus on core health outcomes. Critics warn that this disinvestment will lead to increased suffering, higher healthcare costs, and worsen social problems like homelessness and food insecurity.

          <p>The rivalry between Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese is under scrutiny as it becomes a platform for racist and sexist rhetoric, overshadowing the accomplishments of other WNBA players. Following a physical play between Clark and Reese, online discourse quickly turned abusive, prompting a WNBA investigation into hateful fan comments. The Rice University and the University of Chicago Illinois study suggests racial bias is present in the perception of the players, noting that Reese received more negative attention for similar actions. Experts warn that focusing on a racial agenda could harm the league and diminish the recognition of other talented players like A'ja Wilson.</p>

This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to eliminate DEI programs, reflecting a retreat from corporate pledges made after George Floyd's murder.

This shift has led to dropped investigations and withdrawn support in cases related to voting rights and racial discrimination.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research indicates that a vegan diet can be just as effective as a meat-based diet for muscle growth during strength training, overturning previous assumptions about the superiority of animal protein. Studies show that as long as enough plant-based protein is consumed, the differences in protein synthesis between animal and plant sources are negligible. Mindful plant-based eating, with a variety of protein-rich foods, can deliver the necessary amino acids for muscle development. The key factor remains consistent resistance training, which is crucial for building muscle regardless of the protein source.</p>

While he found a solution for his yellow banana peppers using turmeric, other companies reliant on multiple petroleum-based dyes may face greater difficulties. Extracting natural colors is complex and costly, with some colors like blue being particularly hard to reproduce.

Miniaturists attribute the trend to a desire for control, the visual appeal of detailed scenes, and the craving for deep attention in a distraction-filled world. The art form involves crafting tiny objects and environments, often telling a story through the details, and requires a range of skills from woodworking to found object art. The miniatures community is welcoming, with online support and in-person events, encouraging creativity and artistic expression regardless of perfection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest Beijing may refrain from aggressive fiscal stimulus due to China's economic resilience against US tariff pressures, evidenced by April's macroeconomic data. Investment banks have revised growth outlooks following a tariff truce with the US and supportive central bank policies. While industrial output growth slowed slightly from the first quarter, it still surpassed forecasts, and retail sales increased. Additionally, China's exports exceeded expectations despite US tariffs, indicating a degree of economic stability despite external pressures.</p>

Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict a typical household bill will fall by Â£129 annually, a nearly 7% reduction. This decrease would bring the typical annual dual-fuel bill for direct debit customers to Â£1,720, down from the current Â£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, meaning that total bills depend on individual consumption.</p>
