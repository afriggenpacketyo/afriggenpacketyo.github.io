          <p>The baseball bat famously flipped by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, which led to a temporary suspension, has been sold at auction for $9,882. The incident, which occurred during a sectional tournament, drew national attention and even support from major league players after Rocco's family successfully challenged the suspension in court. All proceeds from the auction, which attracted 68 bids, will be donated to the Haddonfield Little League program where the boy plays. The event was also commemorated with a pin at the Little League World Series.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles were used in the barrage, which damaged infrastructure and residential buildings. In response, Ukraine's military conducted strikes on two major Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran, causing fires and damage. The exchange of fire occurs amidst stalled diplomatic efforts and discussions among EU ministers about freezing Russian assets.</p>

          <p>In a performance at the Hollywood Bowl, singer Angélique Kidjo and cellist Yo-Yo Ma presented "Sarabande Africaine," a concert exploring the African roots of Baroque music. The show highlighted the historical connection between African dances and classical forms like the sarabande, famously used by Bach and Handel. The collaboration, which also featured works by Philip Glass and George Gershwin, blended diverse musical traditions, with Kidjo's powerful vocals transforming familiar pieces. The event celebrated cultural unity and the often-overlooked historical influences that have shaped Western classical music.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, even after a Court of Appeal overturned a key injunction. The ruling struck down a temporary block on using The Bell Hotel in Epping for asylum accommodation, a case seen as a potential precedent. Despite this setback, councils like Epping Forest are considering further appeals, including to the Supreme Court, citing planning law breaches and public safety concerns. The situation has fueled protests and remains a contentious political issue, highlighting the ongoing debate over national immigration policy and local governance.</p>

          <p>Andriy Parubiy, a prominent Ukrainian politician and former speaker of the parliament, was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. The 54-year-old was a key figure in the 2014 Euromaidan protests that led to the ousting of the pro-Russian president. Unverified footage suggests the gunman was disguised as a food delivery courier, and a nationwide manhunt is now underway.

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Declares Trump's Global 'Reciprocal Tariffs' an Illegal Overreach of Power</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 11:13:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on imports from most trading partners are illegal. The court found that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose these taxes, stating the act does not grant the power to levy tariffs. This decision upholds a lower court's ruling and could significantly impact a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for an appeal to the Supreme Court, creating uncertainty for businesses and global markets.</p>

          <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), under the Trump administration, has initiated a nationwide review of public housing authorities to enforce rules against providing assistance to undocumented immigrants. HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced that all public housing agencies have 30 days to conduct an audit to verify the citizenship or eligible immigration status of residents. The administration argues this move will prioritize housing for American citizens, stating that only one in four eligible families currently receives HUD assistance. The policy has drawn praise from some Republicans while raising concerns about its potential to strain resources.</p>

          <p>A landmark study on Iowa's water quality has identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to contamination, but funding intended to promote these findings has been abruptly withdrawn. The $1 million, two-year report detailed how pollutants from the state's powerful farm industry pose risks to drinking water and public health, including potential links to high cancer rates. After the report was finalized, over $400,000 earmarked for public outreach and education was "zeroed out" without explanation by Polk County officials.

The project, which spanned six years and 14 countries, highlights the paradox of destroying nature while simultaneously creating curated illusions of it in zoos, theme parks, and national parks.

Putin is scheduled to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit and hold bilateral talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He will also be the guest of honor at China's Victory Day parade.

          <h2>Opinion: After 21 Months of Conflict, Why Is the World Only Now Acknowledging a Genocide in Gaza?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 09:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article questions why Western institutions and media are only recently beginning to use the term "genocide" to describe the situation in Gaza, despite Palestinians warning of it for nearly two years. The author argues that Palestinian voices and testimony have been systematically dehumanized and dismissed, requiring validation from non-Palestinian or even Israeli sources to be considered credible. The piece critiques the media's framing of the conflict, which often ignores decades of occupation and siege, and the double standards applied to Palestinian and Israeli suffering. It concludes that the recent shift in discourse is a performative act, coming only after the death toll has become impossible to ignore.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified the private colleges in the U.S. that offer the best return on investment (ROI), with Princeton University taking the top spot. The analysis considered factors like financial aid, cost after aid, and post-graduation earnings. While Princeton's tuition is over $65,000, the average student on financial aid pays just over $10,000 and earns a median salary of more than $110,000 a decade after attending. The list also includes Caltech, MIT, and Stanford, highlighting how generous financial aid policies at well-endowed universities can lead to strong financial outcomes for graduates.

          <p>After a nearly 50-year career covering 12 presidential elections, veteran political correspondent Dan Balz is retiring from The Washington Post. In a recent reflection, Balz identified the most significant shift in American politics as its evolution into a "tougher, coarser, and meaner" landscape. He noted that public trust in government has remained low since the Vietnam and Watergate eras, contributing to the current state of political discourse. Balz's departure marks the end of an era for a journalist who has witnessed decades of profound change in the nation's political environment.</p>

Critics argue that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility, which is crucial for maintaining a stable financial system and managing inflation. Should the president gain significant influence over the board, it could impact not only interest rates but also bank regulation and the integrity of the U.S. Treasury system. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, many legal and financial experts see it as a dangerous path toward economic instability.</p>

Despite social media complaints about rising costs, the city's top tourism official, Steve Hill, insists that Las Vegas remains a competitive value destination. In response to the downturn and pricing concerns, some resorts are offering promotions like waived fees and free parking. Officials remain optimistic about the fall season, citing a strong calendar of events and bookings, and argue that the narrative of the city being overpriced is not accurate.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies are growing increasingly concerned about far-right extremists showing interest in using commercially available drones for domestic attacks. Online chatter among these groups indicates they are studying the use of first-person viewer (FPV) drones in conflicts like the war in Ukraine and by drug cartels as a model for a potential insurgency against the U.S. government. Authorities fear these actors, who have a history of targeting critical infrastructure, could use drones for reconnaissance or to deliver explosives. The accessibility and low cost of this technology present a significant new threat for domestic counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
