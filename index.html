          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension by ABC, following his criticism of Donald Trump's MAGA movement. His return was met by both protesters, who demanded a longer suspension, and supporters outside the studio. The controversy arose from comments made during a monologue, leading to concerns from the FCC about broadcast licenses. Regional affiliates owned by Nexstar and Sinclair preempted the show's return.</p>

          <p>Veteran pop star Lulu, 76, has publicly disclosed her past struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew." Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after revealing her secret to family. Lulu, who was a "highly functioning alcoholic," hid her drinking for years, even while participating in "Strictly Come Dancing." Her decision to share her story is intended to be liberating and offer hope, especially given her father also suffered from alcoholism.</p>

          <p>The White House is demanding an investigation into an escalator at the UN that abruptly stopped as President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were stepping onto it. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested it could have been intentional, referencing a newspaper report about UN staff joking about such an act. However, a UN official stated that a person with Trump inadvertently hit the stop lever. Trump later used the incident, along with a faulty teleprompter, to criticize the UN's facilities during his speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young people in the UK are unable to move out of their parents' homes due to escalating living costs. Research by the Skipton Group indicates that nearly 90% of young adults living at home would spend almost half their income on housing and utility bills if they moved out. This situation creates a "lost opportunity" for young people and financial strain for parents. The government acknowledges the crisis, pledging to build 1.5 million homes, while experts call for more social housing.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Tyrique George, who almost left Chelsea, proved his value by scoring and assisting in a Carabao Cup victory against Lincoln City. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George's performance was crucial in Chelsea's comeback. His dedication and unique training regimen, including playing against men from a young age, have set him apart. This display offers manager Enzo Maresca a welcome attacking option, disrupting the typical "breakthrough, loan, sale" narrative for Chelsea academy graduates.</p>

          <p>Mass protests driven by Generation Z are sweeping across Asia, fueled by anger over perceived corruption, social inequality, and lack of opportunities. From Nepal, where protests led to the prime minister's resignation and several deaths, to Indonesia and the Philippines, young activists are leveraging sophisticated technology like TikTok and AI to mobilize. The "nepo kids" phenomenon, where politicians' children display extravagance, has become a key symbol of discontent. While governments acknowledge concerns, the long-term impact of these leaderless, digitally-driven movements on fundamental social change remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has successfully averted all 1,600 projected city worker layoffs, initially planned to close a $1 billion budget shortfall. This achievement follows months of negotiations and cost-cutting measures, including agreements with unions for unpaid holidays and scaling back hiring in police and fire departments. The city also relocated some targeted employees to open positions. While this is good news for the current fiscal year, the mayor acknowledged that long-term budget challenges persist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a player challenge system for called balls and strikes starting in the 2026 season, following years of testing. Teams will have two challenges per game, retaining them if a call is overturned by the automated strike zone (ABS). MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated the system balances the umpire's role with correcting missed calls and maintaining game pace. Players who experienced the system in minor leagues and spring training generally support the challenge format over a fully automated system.</p>

          <p>YouTube is rolling back its permanent ban policy for creators removed due to Covid-19 or election-related misinformation, allowing them to apply for reinstatement. This change, a limited pilot project, follows mounting Republican pressure on tech companies to reverse Biden-era speech policies. An Alphabet lawyer noted that the Biden administration had pressured YouTube to remove videos that didn't technically violate policies, which the company now deems "unacceptable." YouTube aims to enable "free expression" and will not empower third-party fact-checkers for moderation, though it will continue displaying information panels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the U.S. by volume, two years after its sister brand Bud Light lost the title following a consumer boycott. Anheuser-Busch's success with Ultra comes after a challenging period, with Modelo Especial previously holding the top spot. The article notes that other consumer companies, like Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive, have also reported sales slumps among Hispanic consumers, linking it to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies. Michelob Ultra's growth is attributed partly to its non-alcoholic variant and increased marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's substantial increase in H-1B visa fees to $100,000 is prompting calls for Canada to attract skilled workers left behind by the policy change. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has acknowledged this opportunity, hoping to retain more homegrown talent. While experts like Evan Green see a "wonderful opportunity" for Canada, some caution that Canada's immigration system has its own challenges, including scaled-back immigration and lower wages compared to the US. A 2023 Canadian program for H-1B holders saw 10,000 applicants in 24 hours, indicating strong interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, 59, has been found guilty of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course in September last year. Routh was spotted with a rifle by a Secret Service agent and arrested nearby, later attempting self-harm after the verdict. Evidence included a rifle with a scope and a note stating his intention. This marks the second high-profile attempt on Trump's life that year, following a shooting at a rally. The verdict comes amidst heightened concerns over political violence in America.</p>

          <p>Raytheon has introduced its new APG-82(V)X radar, designed to enhance the F-15EX Eagle II's capabilities using gallium nitride (GaN) technology. This advanced radar offers increased range, processing speed, and improved electronic warfare features while maintaining the same form factor as its predecessor. Developed based on U.S. Air Force recommendations, the APG-82(V)X aims to support longer-range air-to-air missiles and enable the F-15EX to operate effectively in more contested environments. Its low probability of intercept modes also make the fighter harder to detect.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has made a dramatic U-turn on Ukraine, now suggesting it can reclaim all its territory, a shift analyzed as part of his increasingly "emboldened" demeanor. This follows a period of perceived appeasement towards Russia and critical remarks about Ukraine. The article links this policy change to a broader pattern of controversial statements, including unscientific claims about autism and a fiery UN address. This combative style, while energizing his base, risks deepening political polarization.</p>
