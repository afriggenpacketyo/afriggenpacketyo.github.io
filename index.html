          <p>An investigation by BBC Wales reveals allegations of a "binge drinking culture" at Bangor Cathedral, part of a diocese recently under scrutiny for safeguarding concerns. Former choir members describe inappropriate events, including a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday and pressure to consume alcohol. These claims follow the retirement of the Archbishop of Wales after reports highlighted excessive alcohol use and blurred sexual boundaries within the diocese. The Church in Wales has acknowledged the issues and is developing a new policy regarding alcohol.</p>

          <p>A sudden and catastrophic flash flood in Texas has resulted in at least 24 deaths, with a major search and rescue operation underway for dozens of missing children from a girls' summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in under an hour, sweeping away homes and vehicles during the July 4th holiday weekend. Officials have declared a state of emergency, citing a lack of advance warning for a flood of this magnitude, which has hampered evacuation and rescue efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on broad tariffs proposed by the Trump administration is set to expire, creating uncertainty for global markets and businesses. While a few narrow agreements have been reached, the widespread "90 deals in 90 days" goal has not been met, raising the possibility of steep new tariffs on numerous countries. Economists and business leaders express concern over the potential for increased inflation and significant costs for US companies, which are already grappling with existing duties.

The study, published in the journal Science, found that the inability of mice to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating the gene responsible for its production, the scientists achieved complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage, raising hopes that this mechanism could one day be applied to human organ repair.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-minute request to halt the deportation of eight men, including one to war-torn South Sudan, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with their removal. Lawyers for the men had argued they could face perilous conditions, as the U.S. government itself advises against travel to South Sudan due to its civil war. The case is part of a broader legal battle over the administration's aggressive deportation policies for immigrants with criminal convictions, even to dangerous countries.</p>

          <p>A protest in Mexico City against mass tourism and gentrification turned violent, with some demonstrators smashing storefronts and harassing foreigners in the popular Roma and Condesa neighborhoods. The march began peacefully, with hundreds of locals protesting soaring rent prices and displacement driven by an influx of "digital nomads" and tourists, primarily from the U.S. The demonstration reflects growing tensions in the capital, where residents feel they are being pushed out of their own communities by the rising cost of living.</p>

          <h2>Connecticut Law Allowing Quick Resale of Towed Cars Criticized as Predatory</h2>

          <p>A Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizing them, a practice critics describe as predatory. Residents in working-class neighborhoods, like those in a Waterbury apartment complex, claim they are being targeted by operators who tow cars for minor infractions like expired registrations. Unable to afford the steep and quickly accumulating fees, many people lose their vehicles, which are essential for their livelihoods, highlighting how the law disproportionately affects low-income individuals.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire, California's largest wildfire of the year so far, has expanded to over 70,800 acres in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, is being fueled by hot and windy conditions and currently threatens 50 structures, with over 200 people under evacuation orders. More than 600 personnel are battling the fire, which has already destroyed one structure, as firefighting efforts continue with air tankers from across the state assisting when conditions permit.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed into law a major legislative package that makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent, boosts defense and border security funding, and enacts significant cuts to federal safety-net programs. Trump celebrated the bill, which passed Congress by a narrow margin, as a victory, while Democrats condemned it as a "betrayal" that benefits the wealthy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation will add over $3 trillion to the national debt, and critics warn it could cause millions to lose health insurance.
