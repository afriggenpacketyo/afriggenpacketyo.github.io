          <p>Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs have requested a sentence of no more than 14 months for his two prostitution-related convictions, arguing he has been sufficiently punished by 13 months in prison under suicide watch. His defense highlights the destruction of his career and reputation, the impact on his family and businesses, and harrowing prison conditions, including an inmate confrontation and limited access to clean water. They portray Combs as a changed man, now sober and teaching other inmates, seeking to return to his family. Prosecutors plan to recommend a substantially longer sentence.</p>

          <p>Southern China is preparing for Super Typhoon Ragasa, the year's strongest storm, with mass evacuations and school/business closures in at least 10 cities. Hong Kong has raised its typhoon warning to level eight as the storm approaches, expected to make landfall in Guangdong province. Authorities warn of a "catastrophic" situation, leading to widespread flight cancellations and residents securing their homes and businesses. The article notes that a warming world is expected to make such tropical storms more intense, highlighting climate change concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully dismantled a vast telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area, which posed a significant threat to the city's telecom systems and the ongoing UN General Assembly meetings. The operation uncovered 300 SIM servers with over 100,000 SIM cards, capable of sending millions of texts per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. This sophisticated, well-funded network was linked to foreign governments and organized crime, including drug cartels and human trafficking rings. The investigation is ongoing, with potential arrests expected.</p>

          <p>Amazon is currently in a federal trial, facing a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging the company used deceptive practices to enroll and retain customers in its Prime membership program.

Amazon denies wrongdoing, asserting its sign-up and cancellation processes are "clear and simple." A judge has already ruled that Amazon violated a consumer protection act, with two executives potentially liable, intensifying the legal battle.</p>

          <p>A Vox article explores the potential for the US to devolve into "competitive authoritarianism," where laws are twisted to undermine political opposition rather than outright criminalize it.

This system relies on incremental erosion of democratic foundations, making it difficult for opposition to compete fairly.

          <p>An archaeological mission, led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez, has discovered evidence of a long-submerged ancient Egyptian harbor linked to the Taposiris Magna Temple near Alexandria. Using sonar and simulation software, the team revealed an old inner harbor and a tunnel connecting it to the temple. This significant find expands knowledge of the site, which Martinez believes is the true resting place of Queen Cleopatra VII, defying the long-held theory of her burial in Alexandria. The team will soon begin underwater excavations, hoping to unravel more mysteries of the Ptolemaic period.</p>

          <p>Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a prominent farm worker activist, claims he was targeted by the Trump administration and ICE for his organizing success, leading to his voluntary departure from the US after months in detention. He alleges his arrest was based on an unnotified deportation order and experienced harsh conditions, including undercooked food and limited medical care, in detention. From Mexico, Juarez Zeferino continues his activism, focusing on inspection of detention centers and ending exploitative H-2A labor programs. ICE denies the allegations, stating he was an "illegal alien with a final order of removal."</p>

          <p>A Guardian commentary criticizes ESPN for increasingly prioritizing influencer-driven content and cozy relationships with sports leagues over traditional journalism. The article argues that hires like Katie Feeney, who produces "lifestyle content," and deals like the NFL's equity stake in ESPN, signal a shift away from critical reporting. This "influencer creep" and focus on "live sport" as the absolute business priority has led to an exodus of respected journalists. The piece contends ESPN is becoming a "souped-up PR agency," trading journalistic credibility for quick clicks and narrative management, presenting a grim outlook for sports media.</p>

          <p>In an Atlantic interview, former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul warns that America faces an existential threat of autocracy, drawing frightening parallels to Vladimir Putin's consolidation of power. He highlights concerns such as the creation of an oligarchy, a push for a one-party system, and crackdowns on free speech, exemplified by the pressure on Jimmy Kimmel's show. McFaul argues that the US Constitution is merely a "piece of paper" without active resistance from "small-d democrats" across society.
