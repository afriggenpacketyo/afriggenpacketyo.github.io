          <p>Nvidia's stock concluded a fifth consecutive day of gains, setting new records and reaffirming its position as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization around $3.8 trillion.

At a recent shareholder meeting, Huang highlighted robotics as the next major growth opportunity for the company, envisioning a future with billions of robots and autonomous vehicles powered by Nvidia technology.

          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to advance President Trump's major legislative package, which includes tax cuts and national security funding, ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The bill's passage is uncertain as the Senate parliamentarian continues to review its provisions, having already rejected key GOP proposals related to Medicaid, gun silencers, and asylum fees. Majority Leader John Thune expressed uncertainty about having enough votes to proceed, while House Speaker Mike Johnson stated the House would not be rushed, requiring 72 hours to review the final text once it passes the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an immediate termination of all trade negotiations with Canada in response to Ottawa's implementation of a digital services tax. The 3% tax targets revenue from large technology companies like Amazon and Google, which is expected to cost U.S. firms approximately $2 billion. In a social media post, Trump called the tax an "egregious" and "blatant attack on our Country," vowing to announce new tariffs on Canadian goods within a week.

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that curtails the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive orders. The 6-3 ruling specifically concerned his order to end birthright citizenship, but the court focused on the procedural issue of judicial authority rather than the order's constitutionality. Trump hailed it as a "monumental win," while critics like Senator Chuck Schumer called it a "terrifying step toward authoritarianism." The decision effectively allows the administration's policies to be implemented while legal challenges proceed through the courts.</p>

          <p>New studies suggest that artificial intelligence is disproportionately threatening entry-level jobs, creating a potential unemployment crisis for recent university graduates. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, unemployment among recent graduates has risen more sharply than for the general population, as AI can now perform many routine data analysis tasks. Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu advises young people to counter this trend by developing highly specialized skills and maintaining flexibility to adapt to evolving technology. The article suggests that while experienced professionals are less vulnerable, educational institutions must urgently adapt their curricula to teach students how to leverage AI as a tool.</p>

Analysts suggest the market may not have fully priced in Coinbase's lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which has itself soared since its public debut.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has significantly limited the power of federal judges to issue universal injunctions, which are court orders that block a government policy nationwide. The ruling stemmed from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but the court's decision focused on the scope of judicial power rather than the policy's merits. Legal experts state this is a major shift, effectively ending the practice of using a single lawsuit to halt an executive action across the country. Going forward, challengers to federal policies will likely need to use other legal mechanisms, such as class-action lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Despite fears that President Trump's recent tariffs would reignite inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. However, experts caution that this buffering effect is likely temporary and that the impact of higher import costs will probably translate into noticeable inflation in the second half of the year.

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace agreement brokered by the United States, aiming to end decades of conflict in eastern Congo. The deal includes provisions for disarmament of non-state armed groups and respect for territorial integrity, and it may also grant U.S. entities access to the region's critical minerals. While officials from both nations expressed optimism, the prominent M23 rebel group has indicated it will not be bound by the agreement. The long-running conflict has displaced over seven million people in what the UN calls a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Although the Senate parliamentarian rejected some proposed Medicaid cuts in the Republican's major budget bill, other significant changes that could reduce coverage remain. Provisions that survived the review include new work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which critics argue are deeply harmful. The parliamentarian did block a proposal to cap states' provider taxes, which help fund Medicaid. However, policy experts warn that states might still be forced to make decisions that result in people losing coverage to compensate for other financial pressures created by the bill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels at a record high, homeowners are weighing whether a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) will be the cheaper borrowing option this summer. Currently, both products have nearly identical interest rates, but this is expected to change. Because HELOCs have variable rates tied to federal actions, they are positioned to become less expensive if the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated rate cuts. However, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers certainty against potential market volatility, making the choice dependent on a borrower's risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face charges, will remain in federal custody.

          <p>A Supreme Court decision affirming a key part of the Affordable Care Act has raised concerns among health law experts about the potential for politicized science. The court ruled that an expert preventive services taskforce falls under the direct authority of the Health and Human Services Secretary. While this upholds the law, experts worry it gives the current administration, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., complete power over what preventive care is recommended and covered by insurance. This comes just after a vaccine panel handpicked by Kennedy subverted scientific consensus on a long-debunked vaccine safety issue.</p>

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus is reportedly considering ending production at its historic UK headquarters in Hethel and establishing a new plant in the United States. Such a move would jeopardize 1,300 jobs in Norfolk. The consideration comes as the company faces significant business challenges from U.S. tariffs on imported cars, which have already led to a temporary production suspension and job cuts. The UK government has negotiated a lower tariff rate, but the ongoing volatility and costs appear to be forcing the Chinese-owned company to re-evaluate its global manufacturing strategy.</p>

When a 3-year-old boy fell into her enclosure, the 8-year-old gorilla gently picked up the unconscious child, cradled him, and carried him to a service door for zookeepers. Her actions, which many attributed to motherly instinct, stood in stark contrast to the tragic 2016 incident involving the gorilla Harambe. Binti Jua, whose name means "daughter of sunshine," is still alive and celebrated her 37th birthday at the Brookfield Zoo this year.</p>

          <p>In the closing arguments of Sean "Diddy" Combs' racketeering and sex trafficking trial, his defense attorney characterized the prosecution as a "fake trial" built on exaggerated evidence. The lawyer argued that the government had unfairly conflated a swinger lifestyle and recreational drug use with a criminal enterprise, mocking the case against the music mogul. This followed a seven-week trial where prosecutors presented 34 witnesses, alleging Combs used his power to facilitate and cover up serious crimes. Combs, who pleaded not guilty, faces a potential life sentence if convicted.</p>
