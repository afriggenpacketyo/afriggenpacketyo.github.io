          <p>President Trump announced another executive order delaying the enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days.  This follows ongoing negotiations regarding a potential sale of the platform to a U.S. entity.  The delay avoids a disruption to TikTok's 170 million U.S. users, but the underlying national security concerns remain unresolved.  The situation highlights the complex interplay between national security, economic interests, and technological regulation.</p>
