          <p>Investors have continued to withdraw funds from ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) funds amid an intensifying backlash fueled by President Trump's policies. The report suggests that the outflows are partly attributable to an anti-ESG sentiment. Investors withdrew $6.1 billion from ESG funds in the first three months of 2025, after yanking out $4.3 billion in Q4 2024, according to Morningstar. As of the end of Q1, U.S. investors held $330 billion in ESG funds, about 10% of the global total.</p>
