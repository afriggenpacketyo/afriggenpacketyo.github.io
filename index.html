          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second consecutive three-year term, marking the first time in 21 years an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance during the campaign. The election occurred amidst heightened geopolitical and trade uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's policies, with the cost of living and energy policy being major concerns for voters. Albanese's victory signals a continuation of center-left governance in Australia, emphasizing improved relations with China and addressing domestic cost of living challenges.</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel New Jersey authorities to permit mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes from the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, which occurred 93 years ago. Researchers believe saliva on stamps and glue could reveal whether Bruno Hauptmann, convicted of the crime, acted alone. While the state police cite concerns about damaging evidence, plaintiffs argue modern forensic science can clarify lingering questions and contribute to a more accurate historical account. The case had a profound impact on American legal and cultural history, expanding the authority of the FBI and making kidnapping a federal offense.</p>

These fantasies offer moral absolution for their actions, but they risk gambling our future on unrealistic technological solutions.
