          <p>Lululemon's stock plunged after its full-year earnings guidance fell significantly below analyst expectations, with the company citing the financial impact of tariffs as a major factor in its reduced profit outlook. Despite beating second-quarter earnings estimates, the athletic apparel retailer slightly missed revenue targets, and same-store sales in the Americas saw a notable decline. CEO Calvin McDonald acknowledged that some product offerings have become stale and announced plans to introduce more new styles in an effort to regain momentum and better resonate with consumers in the U.S. market.

          <p>Michael Schill has announced his resignation as president of Northwestern University following a challenging three-year term. His tenure was marked by significant campus protests regarding the war in Gaza and intense financial pressure after the Trump administration froze nearly $800 million in federal research funding. These funding cuts resulted in a university-wide hiring freeze and the elimination of over 400 staff positions. Schill, who had previously defended a negotiated agreement to end a pro-Palestinian encampment before Congress, will take a sabbatical before returning to teach at the university's law school.</p>

          <p>Texas Representative Ronny Jackson has filed a lawsuit against California Governor Gavin Newsom, challenging a new state law known as the "Election Rigging Response Act." The lawsuit alleges the California law is an unconstitutional and retaliatory measure specifically designed to counteract a recent Texas redistricting plan that favors Republicans. Jackson argues that California's legislation violates its own state constitution by permitting partisan gerrymandering, a practice previously delegated to an independent commission. The suit aims to block the law, which could potentially shift several U.S. House seats to Democrats if enacted by voters in November.</p>

Lawmakers, including several physicians, questioned his handling of COVID-19 vaccine access and his administration's departure from established scientific consensus.

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has intensified with a series of public debate challenges involving multiple political figures. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo called for five debates with Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, who in turn challenged President Trump to a debate, referring to Cuomo as Trump's "puppet." This development follows reports that the White House is attempting to persuade incumbent Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to exit the race, which would create a direct contest between Cuomo and Mamdani. Both Adams' and Sliwa's campaigns have publicly stated they have no intention of dropping out.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock value increased after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings and announced it had secured a $10 billion order for custom AI chips from a new, undisclosed customer. The chipmaker exceeded revenue expectations and provided a robust forecast for the upcoming quarter, driven by significant growth in its AI-related sales. CEO Hock Tan revealed the large order for its custom AI accelerators, referred to as XPUs, has boosted the company's AI revenue forecast for the next year. This development positions Broadcom as a growing competitor in the high-demand AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is evaluating a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The proposal mirrors a law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A.

Proponents argue that cooling should be treated as a utility necessity similar to heating, while landlord associations express concern over potential implementation costs and their subsequent impact on rent prices.</p>

In a rare public appearance at a White House AI education task force meeting, she emphasized the need to prepare children for an AI-driven future with "watchful guidance." Her efforts build upon her first-term "Be Best" initiative and have included championing the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Analysts observe her approach is less about traditional maternal advocacy and more focused on the business and legislative aspects of protecting children online.</p>

However, this article advises caution, urging potential borrowers to ask critical questions before proceeding, especially with a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated. Homeowners should assess how much equity they can realistically access, whether their financial needs are urgent enough to justify borrowing at current rates, and if they might miss out on better rates in the near future.

          <p>The Department of Justice, representing the Trump administration, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the temporary removal of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. This request follows lower court rulings that blocked President Trump's attempt to fire her, citing federal laws that protect members of certain independent agencies from being removed without cause. The administration argues that the modern FTC wields more power than its 1935 predecessor, justifying presidential authority to dismiss its members at will.

          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are experiencing a pervasive "rotten egg" smell, which officials have traced to a large amount of decaying invasive seaweed. The seaweed, identified as Heterosiphonia japonica, was washed ashore by the high surf and winds from the recent Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes in the Good Harbor estuary without strong tides to wash it back out, it releases hydrogen sulfide gas, creating the powerful and unpleasant odor. While officials have assured the public that the smell is part of a natural process, it has become a significant nuisance for the coastal community.</p>

The advice includes evaluating whether to deposit more or less than $10,000, shopping directly with online banks which typically offer higher rates, and not waiting until the official Fed announcement to lock in a favorable rate.

          <p>A wildfire in California's Sierra Nevada foothills has caused significant damage to Chinese Camp, a historic town founded by Chinese miners during the 19th-century Gold Rush. The fire, part of the TCU September Lightning Complex, has consumed several historic buildings in the state-designated landmark, which was home to about 100 residents. Historians and those with ties to the area are mourning the loss of the town, which served as a tangible link to California's past, allowing visitors to experience a living ghost town. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed as firefighting crews continue to battle the blaze.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service has temporarily closed a post office in Torrance, California, and destroyed thousands of mail items after the facility was found to be contaminated with asbestos. While tests indicated no asbestos in the air in worker and public areas, contamination was found in other parts of the building, prompting the shutdown and relocation of services. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is managing the disposal of the affected mail and packages in accordance with safety regulations. It remains unclear how long the post office will be closed or if any employees were exposed to the hazardous material.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Florida's surgeon general has announced the elimination of all vaccine mandates for schoolchildren, making it the first state to take such a step. The move is framed as a defense of bodily autonomy and parental rights, aligning with the public health direction under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision has drawn sharp criticism from many in the public health community, who warn that abandoning decades of established science could lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. The article frames the policy as a paradoxical move at a time of concern over falling birth rates.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated Los Lobos and Los Choneros, two of Ecuador's most powerful criminal gangs, as foreign terrorist organizations. The announcement was made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a visit to Quito, where he pledged security assistance and drone technology to support Ecuador's fight against organized crime. This designation allows Washington to freeze the gangs' assets, target their associates, and share intelligence for operations against them. The move comes as Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa's government struggles to contain a surge in cartel-related violence, which has driven a significant portion of the world's cocaine trade through the country.</p>

          <p>An internal National Football League report from the 2024 season reveals a wide disparity in ticket revenue among its 32 teams. The San Francisco 49ers led the league with $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, significantly outpacing the second-place Dallas Cowboys and the league average. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tennessee Titans ranked last with $81.2 million. The report also detailed that the 49ers had the highest average general admission ticket price, while the New England Patriots charged the most for premium club seats. This data provides insight into the local revenue streams that supplement the league's equally distributed national revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating California privacy laws by improperly tracking smartphone users. The class-action lawsuit, which covered approximately 98 million devices, argued that the company collected user data even when privacy controls were activated, then used this information to sell targeted ads. Although the awarded damages are significantly less than the $30 billion sought by the plaintiffs, the verdict is being hailed as a victory for consumer privacy. Google has denied any wrongdoing, stating the decision misunderstands how its products work, and plans to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Germany's 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign began with a surprising and deserved 2-0 defeat against Slovakia in Bratislava. This marked the first time the German national team has ever lost a World Cup qualifier away from home. The team appeared lethargic and out of sync, a performance head coach Julian Nagelsmann described as "very dark" and lacking in emotion. Players and coaching staff admitted the team was lacking in all areas of the game, from possession to defense. The unexpected loss raises questions about the team's mindset and form just three months after a disappointing Nations League performance.</p>

          <p>England's white-ball cricket team lost its second consecutive one-day international match against South Africa, thereby losing the series with one game still to play. Chasing a target of 331 runs at Lord's, England fell just short, finishing with 325-9 in a five-run defeat. This marks the team's first series loss under captain Harry Brook and their fifth defeat in the last six ODI series. Despite strong individual performances from Joe Root and Jos Buttler, England was unable to maintain the required run rate. The team must now win the final match in Southampton to avoid a home series clean sweep.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the complex legacy of Daniel Levy, who has stepped down as Tottenham's executive chairman after nearly 25 years. He is credited with transforming the club's infrastructure, overseeing the construction of a billion-pound stadium and a modern training complex, making Spurs a financial success. However, his tenure is also defined by a lack of on-field trophies and a high turnover of managers, which made him a polarizing figure among the fanbase. While his business acumen is undeniable, many supporters felt his financial caution often came at the expense of sporting ambition, ultimately overshadowing his significant off-the-field achievements.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has successfully been granted permission to challenge a High Court ruling that allowed the activist group Palestine Action to appeal its proscription under terror legislation. A Court of Appeal judge determined that the government's appeal has a "real prospect of success" and scheduled a hearing for late September. The initial case was brought by the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, who argued that the ban infringes on the right to free speech. The government's move to ban the group came after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged military aircraft, leading to hundreds of arrests.</p>

          <p>As a strike by 3,200 employees in its defense unit enters its second month, Boeing has announced plans to hire permanent replacement workers. The employees, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, went on strike in August after rejecting a contract offer. The union is demanding a better offer, while the company states it is taking this step to ensure it can continue to support its customers, who rely on the production and maintenance of F-15 fighter jets and missile systems.
