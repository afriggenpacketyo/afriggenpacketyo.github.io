          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reversed a lower court's order to dismantle parts of Florida's controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility in the Everglades. The 2-1 ruling permits the site to continue operating while environmental and Native American groups' lawsuit proceeds. The court suggested state and federal officials might successfully argue the facility is not subject to federal environmental reviews, as it is state-operated without federal reimbursement. This decision was lauded by the Department of Homeland Security and Governor Ron DeSantis, while environmental groups expressed disappointment but vowed to continue their legal fight.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles player Jalen Carter was ejected from a game against the Dallas Cowboys for spitting towards quarterback Dak Prescott. The incident occurred before play began and was witnessed by an NFL official, leading to an immediate penalty and removal. While NBC later showed Prescott spitting first, the league is reportedly considering further disciplinary action against Carter, depending on his remorse. This event highlights the ongoing scrutiny around Carter, who was previously involved in a fatal car crash and faced legal charges in 2023.</p>

          <p>PBS is cutting approximately 15% of its workforce, eliminating 34 positions, due to the cessation of federal funding for public broadcasting by Congress and the Trump administration. This, combined with other vacant positions and a lost educational grant, results in over 100 job losses and a 21% revenue hit for PBS. CEO Paula Kerger stated that all facets of the organization would be affected, forcing difficult choices across the public media system. NPR and various public radio stations are also facing budget reductions and layoffs in response to these financial changes.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have committed to providing postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, potentially including an international force. This pledge aims to prevent future aggression and was discussed at a summit where European leaders pressed Donald Trump for US support. While some countries will deploy troops, others will assist with training and equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the development as a significant step, though Russia's Kremlin rejected the notion of such guarantees being acceptable.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani challenged President Trump to a debate, suggesting they "cut out the middle man" after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of mayoral debates.

Mamdani criticized Trump's policies, particularly cuts to SNAP benefits. The complex race involves four candidates, with Mamdani currently leading polls, and both incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa refusing to withdraw despite external pressures.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the U.S. would "blow up" foreign crime groups if necessary, potentially with international collaboration. He announced the designation of Ecuador's Los Lobos and Los Choneros gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. This policy follows a U.S. strike in the Caribbean targeting suspected drug traffickers. Rubio clarified that "co-operative governments" would assist in identifying targets, though Ecuadorian and Mexican governments have not confirmed military assistance. The U.S. is also providing security aid and drone technology to Ecuador to combat soaring drug trafficking violence.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, stating it cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. A judge recently ruled this deployment illegal, violating the Posse Comitatus Act by using military forces for immigration enforcement. Newsom labeled the move "waste, fraud and abuse," highlighting the financial burden and negative impact on guardsmen. The governor had previously filed a lawsuit against the deployment, which he called an "unprecedented and illegal move" and a step towards authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on three Palestinian human rights organizations—the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Al-Haq—for requesting an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into alleged genocide in Gaza. These groups had asked the ICC to investigate Israeli air strikes, the siege, and population displacement. The sanctions follow a year after the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. The U.S., which does not recognize the ICC's authority, has previously sanctioned ICC officials over similar investigations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Police Department officers are now providing security for former Vice President Kamala Harris, assisting the California Highway Patrol, after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection. This temporary arrangement, funded by the city, aims to prevent a security lapse, though Harris is expected to hire her own security soon. The LAPD union criticized the use of local police for a wealthy individual's protection, arguing it diverts resources from Angelenos. Governor Newsom's office condemned Trump's action as "erratic, vindictive political impulses" that endanger public officials.</p>

He predicted major tech companies would develop these, but noted their autonomous nature conflicts with enterprise security requirements. Arora highlighted his company's acquisition of CyberArk to address credential theft, a major cause of data breaches.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing a Trump administration policy that would restrict transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports reflecting their gender identities. This decision is part of ongoing legal challenges to an executive order from President Trump, which aimed to recognize only male and female biological genders, reversing a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" sex indicator. The court found the government failed to counter arguments that the policy reflected "unconstitutional animus" and would cause "immediate and irreparable harms."</p>
