        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a six-month legal dispute, Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin conceded the North Carolina Supreme Court seat to Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. Griffin's challenge, which included attempts to invalidate thousands of votes, ended after a federal court ruling ordered the state elections board to certify Riggs' victory. Riggs won by a margin of 734 votes out of over 5.5 million cast, a result affirmed by two recounts. The case drew criticism for potentially setting a precedent for future election challenges and undermining voter confidence. This New York Times article highlights the end of a contentious legal battle that tested the boundaries of post-election litigation.</p>

          <p>Bipartisan legislation in Congress is considering ending the production of pennies due to economic concerns, as it costs nearly four cents to produce each one-cent coin. Wake Forest University professor Robert Whaples argues that pennies are a waste of time and money, while collectors like the Kilcoyne family, who create custom collectible pennies, worry about the impact on their business. Shelly Gref, owner of Copper Penny Grille, has incorporated thousands of pennies into her bar tops and artwork, appreciating the historical significance of the coins. The fate of the penny remains uncertain as debates continue over its practical and sentimental value.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the attempt by a Republican judge to overturn the reelection of a Democratic state Supreme Court Justice in North Carolina. The effort, which involved challenging thousands of ballots, was criticized for resembling the Bush v. Gore case and potentially violating the Constitution by applying non-uniform election rules after the election. A federal judge temporarily blocked the state from certifying the election results pending litigation. The legal challenge primarily targeted military and overseas voters who cast absentee ballots, arguing their ballots were invalid due to non-compliance with photo ID requirements.</p>

          <p>Actor Michael Pitt, known for his roles in "Boardwalk Empire" and "Dawson's Creek," was arrested in New York City on multiple charges including sexual abuse, strangulation, and sodomy. Pitt pleaded not guilty to all charges, and bail was set at $100,000. The charges stem from four separate alleged incidents involving a former girlfriend between April 2020 and August 2021, with Pitt allegedly attacking her with objects at their home. Pitt's attorney claims the allegations are baseless and suspiciously raised years after the alleged incidents.</p>

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used vehicle prices, increased to its highest level since October 2023, driven by consumer purchases amid fears of price increases due to auto tariffs. The index rose 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% from March, significantly exceeding the typical monthly increase. While tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, they affect new vehicle prices and demand, influencing the used car market. Retail used-vehicle sales in April were down 1.7% compared to March but up 13% year-over-year, with average listing prices exceeding $25,000.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to comply with a lower court's order to transfer Tufts Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont. Ozturk was arrested after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, citing her involvement in associations that allegedly undermined U.S. foreign policy. The court's decision requires the Trump administration to comply with the transfer order by May 14, with a bail hearing scheduled in Vermont.

          <p>The National Audit Office (NAO) reports that the cost of accommodating asylum seekers in the UK is expected to triple, reaching Â£15.3 billion over 10 years, significantly higher than the initial estimate of Â£4.5 billion. This increase is largely driven by the rising number of asylum seekers housed in hotels, which account for three-quarters of accommodation spending despite housing only a third of asylum seekers. Private providers may profit more from hotels than other accommodation types. The NAO says ministers have "few levers" to control the rising costs.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential for President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a move that would be unprecedented and challenge the central bank's independence. Trump has criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates, which he believes would offset the impact of his tariffs. Powell has affirmed the Fed's independence, stating that officials are not removable except for cause. A Supreme Court case may alter the president's power over federal agencies, but it is unclear if it will apply to the Fed.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that U.S. customers could face higher energy bills if the Trump administration ends the Energy Star program, which certifies energy efficiency in home appliances. The proposed closure of the program is part of wider agency cuts and the dissolution of EPA offices. Industry groups and appliance companies have urged the EPA to maintain funding for the program, highlighting its value as a non-regulatory collaboration between the private sector and the government. Senator Jeanne Shaheen argues that cutting the program would benefit billionaires and utility companies at the expense of hardworking Americans.</p>

          <p>Major cuts to federal health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are raising concerns among cancer patients and doctors about potential disruptions in research and treatment. The NIH, the largest funder of cancer research, faces expected job cuts and grant cancellations. Patients express fear that these cuts could delay care and slow down new research, impacting the progress achieved in cancer care over the past two decades. The cuts may also lead to a loss of top talent to other countries and discourage students from pursuing careers in research.</p>

          <p>In the trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree, prosecutors allege the act was seen as a "bit of a laugh" and that the accused feared becoming public enemy number one. Daniel Michael Graham and Adam Carruthers deny charges of criminal damage related to the tree and Hadrian's Wall. The prosecution presented evidence including tracked phone data and a video allegedly showing the tree being felled. The defense argues the men are innocent, with Graham claiming Carruthers admitted to the act and Carruthers denying any involvement.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the symbolism behind India's naming of its military operation against Pakistan as "Operation Sindoor." Sindoor, a red vermilion powder, is a traditional marker of marital status for Hindu women, and the name was chosen to avenge the widowed women from a recent terrorist attack in Kashmir. However, the choice has drawn criticism from feminists who argue that it reinforces patriarchal views. The article highlights the story of Himanshi Narwal, whose image beside her slain husband became a symbol of the attack, and the backlash she faced for advocating peace.</p>

Salt Lake City approved flags with Pride, transgender, and Juneteenth symbols, while Boise designated the Pride flag and an organ donation flag as official city flags. The state laws were viewed by civil rights groups as attempts to prevent the display of flags supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people. Salt Lake City's mayor stated the new flags promote unity and value diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
