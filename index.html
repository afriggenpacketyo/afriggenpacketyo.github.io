          <p>As graduation season approaches, Chinese universities are setting AI content limits for theses to prevent academic misconduct, including data falsification. However, an official publication from the Ministry of Science and Technology warns against relying on AI content detectors, calling it "technological superstition." The publication argues that these tools produce false results, citing examples of student-written content and even a century-old essay being incorrectly flagged as AI-generated. This raises concerns about the accuracy and fairness of using such detectors in academic evaluations.</p>

He seeks to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system, but challenges remain including the risk of price plunges due to oversupply. Ishiba has been pursuing a consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice to lower prices.
