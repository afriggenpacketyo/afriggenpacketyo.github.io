Samson, a 2021 college graduate with no prior experience in European affairs, is a Senior Advisor for the Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. His appointment and the publication of the op-ed suggest a deliberate strategy of “entryism” by right-wing radicals aiming to reshape US foreign policy. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has implemented a successful public, universal pre-K program, offering free education to all 4-year-olds regardless of income. This program addresses both educational and workforce needs, providing children with an extra year of school readiness and offering affordable child care for working parents. Key to Oklahoma's success was a legislative fix that closed a loophole in kindergarten funding, coupled with a voluntary 4-year-old program. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's approach by focusing on how to implement universal pre-K in a way that sustains the private child care industry and develops an appropriate curriculum.
