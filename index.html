          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan of Milwaukee County was arrested by the FBI and charged with obstructing a federal proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent his arrest, according to a criminal complaint. The charges stem from an incident where Dugan allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, evade arrest by ICE officers who were present in her courtroom. Dugan is accused of misdirecting the officers and escorting Flores-Ruiz through a non-public exit, after which he was eventually apprehended after a foot chase. She was released on her own recognizance, and her attorney protests the arrest.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a significant legal victory that restricts compounding pharmacies from producing cheaper, unapproved versions of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. A federal judge denied a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies of these drugs, siding with the FDA's determination that the shortage of semaglutide, the active ingredient, is over. This decision allows the FDA to take action against pharmacies making compounded versions, addressing concerns about patient safety and the lack of FDA approval for these custom-made copies. The company has filed over 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies across 32 states.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with cases surpassing levels not seen since 2019, primarily driven by a large outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in multiple fatalities. As of late April, there have been 884 cases reported across 29 states, with Texas alone accounting for a substantial portion of infections, predominantly affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers. Health officials are emphasizing the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine in preventing the highly contagious disease, which can lead to severe complications and death, and urging people to get vaccinated. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also voiced support for vaccination amidst the deadly outbreak.</p>

          <p>California is updating its regulations for self-driving vehicles, encompassing both robotaxis and driverless trucks, and is now soliciting public feedback on the proposed rules. The new regulations aim to enhance public safety, encourage innovation, and establish a clear framework for autonomous vehicle technology testing and deployment. The proposed rules outline a permitting process for testing with a safety driver, driverless testing, and eventual deployment of driverless vehicles, and will also allow autonomous trucks to be tested on public roads. The regulations also include data-reporting requirements and standards for interactions with first responders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's trade policies, rooted in the premise that a trade deficit equates to subsidizing another nation, are failing against China due to several key factors. China needs American dollars less than the U.S. needs Chinese goods, minerals, and industrial inputs, and China's government faces less domestic political pressure to relent. America's allies are also unwilling to join the trade war, as they are heavily reliant on Chinese exports and do not see the U.S. as a more reliable trade partner. The longer the trade war continues, the more desperate Trump may become for a deal.</p>

          <p>The posthumous publication of Joan Didion's therapy notes, titled "Notes to John," has sparked debate about the ethics of publishing a writer's unpublished work after their death. The notes, detailing sessions with her psychiatrist from 1999 to 2003, focus on her adopted daughter Quintana's struggles with alcoholism. While some argue it provides further insight into Didion's life and pain, others question whether the reticent and exacting writer would have welcomed such intimate journals seeing the light of day.</p>
