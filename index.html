          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump to discuss economic developments, including growth, employment, and inflation, while emphasizing that monetary policy decisions would be based on incoming economic data and its impact on the outlook. Powell stressed the Fed's commitment to setting monetary policy on "careful, objective, and non-political analysis." This meeting occurs amid Trump's repeated calls for lower interest rates and concerns about inflationary tariffs. Markets largely expect the Fed to maintain current rates until there is more clarity on tariff uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering requesting emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, citing potential national security and economic harms. This action comes after Trump's aides criticized the trade-court judges who struck down his "reciprocal" tariffs. The administration is also seeking a temporary pause of the tariff ruling's enforcement while the case is appealed. A separate federal judge also declared many of Trump's tariffs unlawful, leading to White House accusations of judicial overreach. (not investment advice)</p>

The report, by Tagnawa, highlights that immigrant women and limited English speakers felt particularly unsafe in emergency shelters. The housing crisis, exacerbated by the reopening of West Maui to tourists, compounded feelings of powerlessness among survivors, and may have fueled forms of domestic violence such as coercive control. The report calls for gender-responsive emergency management reforms.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has backed a multibillion-dollar oil railroad expansion in Utah, overturning a lower court’s decision that halted the project. The ruling limits the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), potentially paving the way for faster fossil fuel expansion. Environmental groups argue that the decision endangers local communities and weakens their ability to stop harmful developments. The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, which would transport up to 350,000 barrels of crude oil a day, more than quadrupling oil production in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings, but U.S. export controls restricting sales of its H20 chip to China are creating challenges. CEO Jensen Huang said China could be a $50 billion market that is effectively closed to Nvidia, and that export controls were misguided. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Looking forward, Huang is emphasizing the potential for Nvidia's GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers through AI inference. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision is part of the administration's ongoing dispute with Harvard and its broader crackdown on student visas. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in a ruling against Trump's global tariff policy, arguing it will cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and strip the president of leverage in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has backtracked on its policy regarding Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, giving the school 30 days to challenge the revocation of its certification. This follows a previous announcement that the school's certification would be terminated due to alleged antisemitism on campus. A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without following proper legal procedure. Harvard alleges that the administration's actions violate its First Amendment rights.</p>
