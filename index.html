          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global investors at the Milken Institute Global Conference, outlining President Trump's "America First Vision." Bessent emphasized tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs as key components of the economic agenda, specifically appealing to wealthy investors. While Trump claimed numerous trade deals were in progress, none have been announced since the tariff pause, despite hints of a potential agreement with India. The administration aims to make the U.S. more attractive for investors by reducing government waste and promoting private investment.</p>

United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily at Newark, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area."

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce is urging the Trump administration to grant tariff exclusions for small businesses importing goods, warning that tariffs could harm Main Street and trigger a recession. President Trump has said that trade deals would be reached soon, but economists fear tariffs are already weighing on growth. Small businesses, unlike large corporations, may not be able to absorb price shocks or navigate supply chain changes.</p>
