          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock increased by 8% after the company announced better-than-expected second-quarter financial results. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 million, a 35% year-over-year increase, and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million from $32.8 million the previous year. CEO Adam Aron credited the positive performance to a recovering box office, growth in premium offerings, and successful debt management, which has pushed maturities out to 2029. The company also saw a 26% rise in attendance and record-breaking revenue per patron. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a rally after a report indicated President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. The move, which Trump confirmed he is looking at, could shift cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, a change that would have significant tax and investment implications for the industry. While the President cannot unilaterally make the change, his support is seen as a major catalyst for the nearly $80 billion market. Industry leaders and analysts view the potential reclassification as a "gamechanger" with bipartisan support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is placing the Washington, D.C. police department under federal control and deploying 800 National Guard troops, citing what he termed an emergency of "out-of-control crime." This historic move, invoking the district's Home Rule Act, was met with strong condemnation from local officials, who pointed to official statistics showing a significant decline in violent crime. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalbe called the action "unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful," and signaled a legal challenge. The federal control is statutorily limited to 30 days unless extended by Congress.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's refusal to consider territorial concessions, or "land swapping," without constitutional approval. Trump stated he "very, very severely" disagrees with Zelenskyy's handling of the situation and reiterated his belief that the war should not have happened. He described his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a "feel-out meeting" to push for a quick end to the conflict. Trump emphasized that he believes a deal can be made and that he will be going into the talks "fully loaded."</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed an unconventional deal where the U.S. government will receive 15% of the revenue from Nvidia's sales of its H20 AI chip to China. The agreement was negotiated directly between Trump and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in exchange for easing export restrictions on the chip, which Trump described as "obsolete." This revenue-sharing arrangement is a novel approach to managing the export of sensitive technology amid national security concerns. The legal authority for such a deal remains unclear, and it represents a new twist in the ongoing U.S.-China tech competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the differences between Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities as retirement savings tools. IRAs, including Traditional and Roth versions, are tax-advantaged investment accounts that offer growth potential and flexibility but come with market risk. In contrast, annuities provide a guaranteed income stream, protecting against market volatility but often involving higher fees and less flexibility. The choice depends on an individual's age, risk tolerance, and financial goals, with many planners suggesting a hybrid approach that uses both vehicles to balance growth with security.

          <p>Major U.S. automakers like Tesla, GM, Ford, and Rivian are adjusting their strategies in response to the Trump administration's changing policies on electric vehicles, including the impending end of federal tax credits.

Ford is launching a new program for low-cost EVs, while Tesla's CFO acknowledged a potential for "a few rough quarters." The changes are forcing a re-evaluation of product lineups, spending, and production plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with non-traditional tenants such as churches, entertainment complexes, and expanded Barnes & Noble stores. This strategy of subdividing large spaces aims to create "cross-shopping" opportunities and transform malls into community hubs. Mall owners report that this diversification is increasing foot traffic and revenue, as visitors drawn by one destination stay to shop or dine at others. Data shows an increase in mall visits, suggesting the shift away from a purely retail-focused model is succeeding.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower is set to reach its peak on the nights of August 11 and 12, offering a display of bright, fast-moving meteors. The shower, caused by debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet, is best viewed after midnight in a dark location away from city lights. However, this year's peak coincides with a bright Sturgeon Moon, which will likely reduce the visibility of fainter meteors. Experts recommend patience and allowing at least 20 minutes for eyes to adapt to the dark to maximize the chance of seeing the celestial event.</p>

This move has been praised by many for its consumer-friendly approach. However, figures like Jake Paul have used the news to highlight the UFC's total revenue, urging fighters to demand a larger share and questioning the company's past reliance on "PPV excuses" for fighter pay.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that male rapists should "probably" lose the right to self-identify their gender. The comment comes after the intense controversy in 2023 surrounding transgender offender Isla Bryson, who was initially sent to a women's prison. Sturgeon admitted she was partly responsible for the debate on gender recognition losing its "sense of rationality" and should have been more "straightforward" at the time. Her apparent shift in position on the highly divisive issue has drawn criticism from political opponents and former allies.</p>
