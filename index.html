          <p>Cleveland Browns General Manager Andrew Berry has publicly criticized rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders for recent speeding citations, calling the behavior "not smart." Sanders was ticketed twice for driving at high speeds, including once at 101 mph in a 60-mph zone. Berry emphasized the danger such actions pose to others and stated the team has addressed the issue with Sanders. The quarterback, who has acknowledged his "wrong choices," is currently competing for a spot on the team after an unexpected slide in the NFL Draft.</p>

          <p>Studies on the four-day workweek show that increased employee happiness stems from more than just extra free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a significant factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. Faced with a condensed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes and eliminate unnecessary tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control over their work. This boost in professional satisfaction positively impacts overall well-being, improves work-life balance, and can even strengthen team spirit through shared accountability.</p>

          <p>France's long-standing political and economic influence in its former African colonies, known as "Françafrique," is collapsing, particularly in the Sahel region. This shift is forcing French companies, which once enjoyed preferential treatment, to adapt to a new reality where they face intense competition from nations like China, Turkey, and Russia. As anti-French sentiment grows, French corporations are losing market share and major contracts, such as Orano's uranium mining license in Niger. In response, some companies are pivoting to other African regions or forming local partnerships to maintain a more indirect presence.</p>

While she has intimate knowledge of Epstein's operations, legal experts question her credibility, citing past perjury charges, and speculate the meetings may be a political distraction rather than a genuine effort to uncover new information about Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's approach to economics and leadership, arguing it is driven by an insatiable avarice and a focus on personal, adversarial dealmaking rather than market principles. Trump's "egonomics" links his narcissistic urges directly to accumulating wealth, using deals—successful or not—to bolster his brand and personal fortune. His preference for tariffs is presented not as a coherent economic policy but as a tool to dominate the global prestige economy, akin to a "big man" in a ceremonial exchange system. The analysis concludes that money itself, not power or prestige, is Trump's ultimate goal.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of China's world-renowned Shaolin Temple, is under criminal investigation for allegedly violating Buddhist precepts. The temple, famous as the birthplace of Zen Buddhism and Shaolin kung fu, also accused Shi of maintaining improper relationships with multiple women and fathering illegitimate children. Shi, who became abbot in 1999, is known as the "CEO monk" for his commercialization of the temple's heritage. This investigation adds to past controversies, including his acceptance of a luxury car from the local government in 2006 for his contributions to tourism.</p>

          <p>In Bogotá, Colombia, a frustrating scam known as "pinchallantas" (tire-puncturers) is on the rise. Vandals on motorcycles intentionally spread sharp objects on roads to damage car tires. They then approach the stranded drivers and guide them to nearby mechanics who are allegedly part of the scheme. These mechanics are accused of creating additional holes in the tires and then overcharging for the repairs. Despite a police crackdown targeting suspect repair shops, the fast-moving nature of the saboteurs makes them difficult to catch in the act.</p>

          <p>According to former England and Lions scrum-half Matt Dawson, the British and Irish Lions need to complete a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia to cement their place as a legendary team. While celebrating the current 2-0 series lead, Dawson argues that a clean sweep would be a historic achievement, not seen on a major tour in decades. He contrasts the current squad's mindset with his 1997 team, which celebrated heavily after securing the series and lost the final test. Dawson suggests that to achieve this goal, coach Andy Farrell may need to rotate the squad to keep players fresh for the final match.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is using billboards in rural, Republican-leaning states to blame Donald Trump for the financial strain on local hospitals. The signs, placed near struggling facilities in Missouri, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Montana, highlight the impact of the Trump-era "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA), which cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid. Rural hospitals, which heavily rely on Medicaid, have been closing at an alarming rate, and analyses predict the OBBBA will exacerbate these financial pressures, potentially leading to hundreds more closures across the country.

          <p>After surviving the pandemic and a wave of anti-Asian violence, Oakland's historic Chinatown is now facing a new challenge: economic pressure from US-China trade tariffs. Merchants in the vibrant district report that while customer traffic remains steady, spending has dropped significantly on goods imported from China, such as traditional foods, teas, and furniture. One long-time supermarket owner noted that costs have risen by an average of 50% due to the tariffs, forcing customers to cut back on their purchases and threatening the vitality of the local businesses that depend on these imports.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic posits that the perceived corruption and cronyism of the Trump administration are inadvertently making socialism more appealing to a new generation. The author argues that while historical socialist economies failed spectacularly, widespread dissatisfaction with the current economic system, which many feel is rigged for insiders, creates an opening for alternatives. The piece contends that Trump's rhetoric vilifies free exchange and his actions benefit a select few, discrediting market principles. This environment, the author suggests, leaves the case for free-market capitalism undefended, allowing socialist ideas to gain traction among those disillusioned with the status quo.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author laments the disappearance of comprehensive arts and music event listings from publications like The New York Times, The Village Voice, and Time Out. These listings once served as a vital guide for discovering new and niche artists, helping to build careers and foster robust subcultures. The shift to algorithm-driven social media and "poptimist" journalism, which focuses on already-popular acts, has made it harder for emerging artists to gain visibility. The article argues this trend not only hurts individual artists but also weakens the entire cultural ecosystem by stifling the cross-pollination of ideas between niche and mainstream music.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the U.S. is rooted in the post-Civil War era, when employers in service industries, reluctant to pay newly freed Black workers a fair wage, encouraged customers to tip instead. This system was later codified with the creation of the "tipped minimum wage," which under federal law is just $2.13 an hour, with the expectation that tips make up the difference to the standard minimum wage. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this system persists largely due to intense lobbying from groups like the National Restaurant Association, effectively shifting the responsibility of paying a worker's wage from the employer to the customer.</p>
