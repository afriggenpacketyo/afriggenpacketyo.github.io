          <h2>Advocates Warn of Unaffordable Payments Under New Student Loan Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 09:21:26 EDT</div>

          <p>Consumer advocates are raising alarms that changes to the federal student loan system under the Trump administration could leave borrowers with unaffordable payments. The new policy phases out the income-driven SAVE plan, replacing it with a new program that experts estimate could more than double monthly bills for many individuals. Critics warn this shift will significantly increase the financial stress on student loan holders and heighten the risk of widespread defaults. The changes mark a significant departure from the previous administration's approach to managing student debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to its lowest level in three months, signaling a sturdy labor market despite economic uncertainties. The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims dropped to 221,000, continuing a five-week decline and beating analyst forecasts. This positive indicator comes alongside recent strong job growth, though concerns remain about the potential impact of tariffs and corporate layoffs on the broader economy. The data suggests resilience in the U.S. job market for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, dropped significantly after President Donald Trump announced he had secured an agreement with Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. In a social media post, Trump praised the move as "just better," causing ADM's stock to tumble as much as 6%. Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, while the Corn Refiners Association warned the switch could cost thousands of American manufacturing jobs and depress farm income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An African Union protocol established in 2018 to allow for the free movement of people across the continent has been slow to gain traction, with only four of 55 nations having fully ratified it. The initiative, intended to complement the African Continental Free Trade Area, has been hampered by member states' concerns over national security risks and the potential loss of government revenue from visa fees. Proponents argue that free movement is essential for trade and that model countries like Rwanda have seen economic benefits from open-border policies.</p>

          <h2>Southeast Asian Nations Concerned Over US Tariffs Targeting Chinese Transshipments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has struck new trade deals with Vietnam and Indonesia that include lower general tariffs but impose heavy duties on "transshipped" goods. This policy is designed to curb the practice of Chinese products being rerouted through Southeast Asian countries to evade U.S. tariffs on China. The region is now concerned about how broadly Washington will define transshipment, as a punitive interpretation could impact nearly all exports from these nations that contain Chinese-made components.

          <p>The United Kingdom's Labour government has announced it will lower the voting age to 16 for all UK-wide elections before the next general election. The reform is expected to enfranchise approximately 1.5 million teenagers and is part of a broader package aimed at increasing democratic participation. Additional measures include moving toward an automated voter registration system and expanding the types of identification accepted at polling stations, such as UK-issued bank cards, to make voting more accessible.</p>

The recent reversal by the Trump administration, which now claims no such list exists after years of promising its release, has fueled further suspicion and political infighting.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced a voluntary redundancy program with the goal of eliminating up to 500 management jobs in the United Kingdom. The luxury carmaker attributed the decision to pressure on its sales and profits resulting from U.S. trade tariffs and the planned phasing out of several older Jaguar models. The move comes despite a recent UK-US trade deal that reduced tariffs on car imports, which industry experts say still represents a significant cost increase for the company.</p>
