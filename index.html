          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has announced that the company's corporate workforce is expected to shrink in the coming years due to the increasing adoption of generative artificial intelligence tools. In a memo to employees, Jassy stated that fewer people will be needed for certain jobs, while new roles will emerge, encouraging employees to learn how to use AI tools to increase efficiency. This directive follows over 27,000 layoffs since 2022 and additional cuts this year, impacting various divisions within the company. As of March, Amazon had 1.56 million full-time and part-time employees globally, in addition to temporary workers and contractors.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, amending the Crime and Policing Bill to remove the threat of prosecution for ending a pregnancy. The amendment, led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, addresses the 1% of abortions that occur after 24 weeks, emphasizing compassion over criminalization for women in desperate circumstances. Stella Creasy proposed a further amendment to enshrine abortion access as a human right, though it did not go to a vote, while a Conservative amendment seeking in-person consultations before medication abortions was defeated. The current law permits abortion up to 24 weeks and beyond under certain conditions, such as when the woman's life is in danger.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced T1 smartphone will be manufactured in the United States, experts believe it will likely be made in China. The company stated the phone, which will retail for $499 and run on Android, would be "built in the United States," but industry analysts suggest it was likely designed and will be manufactured by a Chinese firm. Experts cite the lack of readily available local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and the impracticality of designing a phone from scratch domestically as reasons for their skepticism. This comes after President Trump previously urged Apple to manufacture its iPhones in the U.S., a move experts deem nearly impossible and costly.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by ICE agents at immigration court in Manhattan while observing proceedings and requesting a judicial warrant in a case. According to Lander's office, he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of court. The Department of Homeland Security stated Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, which Lander's wife disputes, claiming he was merely asking for a judicial warrant. The arrest has drawn criticism from fellow politicians and advocates, who allege it is an abuse of power and a threat to democracy, with Lander's mayoral competitors demanding his release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House and Senate Republicans are proposing to eliminate economic hardship and unemployment deferments for federal student loan borrowers as part of their "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." These deferments currently allow borrowers to pause monthly payments during periods of joblessness or financial setbacks, often without accruing interest. Critics, like Abby Shafroth of the National Consumer Law Center, express concern that nixing these deferments could lead to increased student loan defaults during times of economic difficulty. The Trump administration projected that the number of student loan borrowers in default could rise from 5 million to roughly 10 million in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 4% decline following a report that the electric vehicle maker is temporarily halting production of Cybertruck and Model Y models at its Austin, Texas, facility. According to Business Insider, the production stoppage is scheduled to begin on June 30 and will last for a week to allow for maintenance on the production lines. This would be the third such shutdown at the Austin facility in the past year, although Tesla has not yet commented on the report.

They are requesting the Supreme Court to consider their case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit weighs in.

Captioned with phrases like "This is what happens When Marxists don't get their way," the posts appeared to blame Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the shootings. Lee later condemned the attacks on his official Senate account, but the initial posts drew condemnation from Democrats and former RNC Chair Michael Steele.</p>

Patients report experiencing extremely painful sore throats, with some comparing the sensation to swallowing razor blades or glass.

          <h2>Trump's Stance on Israel-Iran Conflict Remains Unclear</h2>

          <p>President Trump's position on the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran is ambiguous, as he simultaneously calls himself a "peacemaker" and labels Iran's Supreme Leader an "easy target." While the U.S. government claims it was not actively involved in Israel's assault on Iran, Trump has made conflicting statements on social media, suggesting a potential shift away from his previous stance against foreign military conflicts. Analysts suggest that Israel may have convinced the U.S. that a military attack against Iran could help advance nuclear talks, while others believe Trump's stance is influenced by divisions within his own base regarding military deployments in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A review by House Judiciary Committee Democrats found that President Trump's recent presidential pardons have cost crime victims and taxpayers approximately $1.3 billion in restitution and payments. The pardons absolved hundreds of convicted criminals from having to pay for damages and restitution caused by their crimes, including corporate fraudsters and tax evaders. The report cited examples such as Todd Chrisley, who was freed from a $17.7 million restitution payment, and Carlos Watson, who was spared from $36.7 million in restitution payments. The White House defended the pardons as righting the wrongs of political prosecutions.</p>
