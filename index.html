          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of his order is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the majority had erred in assessing whether to allow the revocation of the immigrants' special status. Trump's initial order directed the Department of Homeland Security to end "categorical parole programs," which shielded these immigrants from deportation and allowed them to work legally in the U.S. This decision allows DHS to revoke their protected status while the 1st Circuit considers the appeal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly pursuing a second attempt to sever ties between the United States and China. This effort involves initiating a trade war, implementing export controls, and revoking student visas, signaling a renewed push to economically separate the two countries. The article suggests that officials are aiming to diminish the economic interdependence that has characterized the relationship between the U.S. and China for decades, focusing on areas like trade, technology, and education. These actions could potentially reshape global trade dynamics and prompt significant adjustments for businesses and individuals operating in both nations.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania as the deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel is finalized. This visit follows Trump's announcement of a "planned partnership" between the two companies, which aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania. Senator David McCormick stated that the agreement includes an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members, with the U.S. potentially holding a golden share for government approval of board members and production levels. The United Steelworkers union opposes the sale, citing concerns about potential job risks, while U.S. Steel has warned about job losses and headquarters uncertainty without the acquisition.

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to terminate a program that temporarily allowed over 500,000 individuals from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela to live and work in the United States while a legal battle continues. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, with Jackson stating that the court's decision would cause needless human suffering by upending the lives of nearly half a million noncitizens. The program, known as CHNV, was created during the Biden administration to address the growing number of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and promote legal immigration. This decision is part of Trump's broader efforts to curb immigration into the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new report accuses major tech firms like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of enabling the "industrial scale theft" of premium video services, particularly live sports. The report, by Enders Analysis, argues that a lack of action by these companies is costing broadcasters significant revenue and exposing users to cyber-crime risks. The Amazon Fire Stick is specifically identified as a key enabler of piracy, allowing access to illegal streams. Sports broadcasting is a lucrative business, and the increasing cost of rights deals leads some fans to seek illegal streams, putting them at risk of malware and phishing scams.</p>

          <p>Proposed changes in the House Republicans' "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could extend federal student loan repayment periods to 30 years, raising concerns about "indentured servitude," according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The bill would consolidate repayment options to two: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan (RAP) with loan forgiveness after 30 years. Monthly bills under RAP would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10%. This plan is expected to increase the deficit and prolong the financial burden for borrowers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed subdued growth in April as spending slowed. This data point is crucial as the Federal Reserve has paused interest rate cuts until there is more clarity about President Trump's economic policies. The article emphasizes the importance of this metric in shaping monetary policy decisions and its impact on the overall economic outlook. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring inflation trends to determine the appropriate course of action regarding interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has accused China of violating a recent trade agreement with the United States, casting doubt on the accord's stability. The criticism follows pessimistic comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding U.S.-China trade talks. A trade agreement between the U.S. and China had previously reduced tariffs, boosting the stock market and easing recession concerns. However, a court ruling invalidated the China tariffs, adding uncertainty to the policy's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk appeared together in the Oval Office as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concluded. Musk, who led the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. While Musk aimed to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, DOGE's efforts have saved roughly $160 billion, though the accuracy of these figures has been questioned. Musk has recently disagreed with Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," citing concerns about its impact on the budget deficit.</p>
