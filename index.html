          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for the second quarter, surpassing earnings expectations but falling short on revenue. The bank's profit saw a modest increase to $7.12 billion, while revenue grew to $26.61 billion, slightly below analyst predictions. A key factor was the net interest income, which missed estimates despite climbing for the fourth consecutive quarter amid loan and deposit growth. CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted consumer resilience and strong performance in the bank's markets businesses.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a notable upswing, with Bitcoin and Ether prices rising, driven by renewed investor optimism. This positive sentiment follows a temporary setback in the U.S. House, where key crypto-related bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, failed to advance. Despite the legislative snag, market analysts and a statement from President Trump suggest the bills will eventually pass, fueling a recovery in crypto-related stocks. The potential regulation is seen as a significant step toward legitimizing the digital asset ecosystem in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent political rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been handed an additional prison sentence of one year and eight months. The conviction is for allegedly insulting and threatening Istanbul's chief prosecutor. This new sentence comes while Imamoglu is already in pre-trial detention on separate corruption charges, which his party claims are politically motivated. These legal challenges, including a previous conviction and the annulment of his university diploma, could prevent him from running in future elections.</p>

          <p>This article explores the differences between 401(k) plans and annuities as tools for retirement savings, highlighting their distinct approaches to financial security. A 401(k) offers investment growth potential and flexibility, but its value is subject to market performance. In contrast, an annuity provides a guaranteed income stream, shifting risk to an insurance company but often involving higher fees and less flexibility. For many retirees, a hybrid strategy that combines the growth potential of a 401(k) with the stable income of an annuity may offer a balanced approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a bipartisan move, U.S. senators have decided to protect the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from proposed budget cuts. An initial plan sought to reduce government spending by canceling previously approved funding, including $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/AIDS program. After senators from both parties expressed concern, an amendment was introduced to spare the PEPFAR funding. The program, initiated by President George W. Bush, is credited with saving tens of millions of lives and has historically enjoyed broad support.</p>

          <p>Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, one of the last living survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp, is celebrating her 100th birthday. She famously survived the Holocaust because her ability to play the cello earned her a place in the women's orchestra at Auschwitz. For decades, she has been a prominent voice against antisemitism and extremism, sharing her story to educate future generations and serve as a witness for the millions who were murdered. Despite her despair over rising global antisemitism, her centenary is being marked by celebrations honoring her life and tireless commitment to remembrance.</p>

          <p>This article explains the health risks associated with Vibrio bacteria, which thrive in warm, low-salinity coastal waters like the Baltic and North Seas. While infections, known as vibriosis, are relatively rare, they can be serious and are becoming more common due to rising sea temperatures linked to climate change. Most infections occur from eating raw shellfish or when the bacteria enter an open wound from the water. Health agencies advise cooking shellfish thoroughly and avoiding swimming with open cuts in at-risk areas, especially for individuals with compromised immune systems.</p>

          <p>A tragedy unfolded in southern Gaza where at least 20 people were killed in a crush at an aid distribution site run by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF reported that 19 people were trampled to death and one was stabbed amid a chaotic surge for aid, blaming armed individuals affiliated with Hamas for the unrest. However, Hamas and local hospital officials dispute this, attributing the deaths to suffocation from tear gas and the crush caused by security contractors closing gates. The incident highlights the desperation and extreme danger surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Bankrate survey indicates that a majority of U.S. homeowners are unwilling to sell their homes in 2025, regardless of mortgage rate fluctuations. This "lock-in effect" stems from homeowners being reluctant to give up the historically low mortgage rates they secured before 2022 for the significantly higher rates of today. This reluctance to sell is a primary reason why the inventory of available homes remains low, contributing to record-high prices and making it especially difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market. The survey shows housing affordability is now a major barrier for both buyers and potential sellers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Barclays Bank £42 million for significant failures in its anti-money laundering controls. The regulator found that Barclays did not conduct proper due diligence on two clients, Stunt & Co and WealthTek, which facilitated the movement of funds linked to financial crime. A large portion of the fine relates to Barclays' relationship with Stunt & Co, which was connected to a multimillion-pound money laundering operation. The FCA noted that Barclays received a reduced fine due to its cooperation and voluntary payments to affected clients.</p>

In a private meeting, Mamdani explained that while many use the term to express support for Palestinians, he understands the pain it causes and is willing to stop using the specific language.

          <p>This article provides a guide to current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), noting that top accounts offer returns that can outpace inflation. While national average rates for various terms are relatively low, online banks are offering significantly more competitive annual percentage yields (APYs), particularly on short-term CDs. The phenomenon of an "inverted yield curve" means that CDs with terms of one year or less often have higher rates than those with three or five-year terms. To maximize returns, savers are advised to compare rates from online institutions. (not investment advice)</p>
