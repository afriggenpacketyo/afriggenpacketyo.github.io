          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 800 D.C. National Guard members and taken temporary control of the city's Metropolitan Police Department to address what it calls a crime emergency. This action is possible due to Washington D.C.'s unique federal status, allowing the president authority not available in states. While officials state the Guard's role is primarily supportive, they have arrest powers under their current activation status. The move has created tension with local D.C. officials over the chain of command and the necessity of the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a U.S. deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, which passed without an agreement. The choice of Alaska, once Russian territory, adds historical context to the high-stakes diplomatic effort. The White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," cautioning against expectations of an immediate breakthrough or ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that any negotiations about Ukraine's future conducted without its participation will not be effective. While acknowledging a recent signal from Russia suggesting a potential willingness to discuss a ceasefire, he remains firm that Ukraine will not concede territory. Zelenskyy expressed concern that the primary beneficiary of the one-on-one meeting in Alaska would be Vladimir Putin, who seeks the legitimacy of a photo-op with the U.S. president.

          <p>In the wake of a targeted shooting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta campus, employees are reporting a sense of frustration due to what they describe as a leadership vacuum and poor communication. An initial all-hands meeting with the new director was criticized as "insultingly insufficient" and technically flawed. Staffers contrasted this with more effective, empathetic communication from a specific center's career leader, highlighting a desire for steady and experienced guidance during the traumatic event. The incident has also underscored the irony of recent layoffs within the CDC's firearm violence prevention unit.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a one-year program to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support the domestic economy. The plan, jointly released by the finance ministry and central bank, will cover one percentage point of annual interest on qualifying loans for purchases like cars and education. This policy is part of a wider government strategy to unlock consumer spending potential amid economic pressures. The central government will bear 90% of the subsidy cost, with provincial governments covering the remainder. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced the state will proceed with drawing new, more Democratic-leaning congressional maps, claiming President Trump "missed" a deadline to halt a Texas redistricting plan. This move is part of a larger political battle where Democratic states are threatening retaliatory gerrymandering to counteract what they see as unfair power grabs in Republican-led states. Newsom had previously offered to stand down if other states abandoned their efforts. The plan would require asking California voters to approve the new maps in the November ballot.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival rates have doubled in the last 50 years, a new study highlights a growing gap between different types of the disease. Cancers like melanoma now have 10-year survival rates above 90%, thanks to advances in treatment and detection. However, progress has been minimal for some of the deadliest cancers, including those affecting the pancreas, esophagus, and lungs, which still have survival rates below 20%. Experts are calling for a renewed focus on research and early detection for these harder-to-treat cancers to close this widening disparity.</p>

Historically concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico, cases are now being reported further north along the Atlantic coast in states like the Carolinas and Connecticut.

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested a suspect in the violent assault of a 70-year-old Sikh man, who was beaten with a golf club and remains in critical condition. While authorities have made an arrest and believe the motive was a property dispute, the victim's family and Sikh community leaders are questioning why the attack is not being investigated as a potential hate crime. Advocacy groups point to a history of violence against Sikhs, who are often targeted due to their articles of faith, like turbans and beards, and are urging a more thorough investigation into bias as a motive.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store. Musk alleges that Apple's ranking and promotion system makes it impossible for his Grok AI chatbot to achieve the number one ranking, unfairly favoring competitor OpenAI. In a post on his social media platform X, he questioned if Apple was "playing politics" by not featuring his apps more prominently. Apple responded that its store is designed to be fair and that rankings are based on objective criteria.</p>

The ruling follows a lawsuit detailing complaints of severe overcrowding, filth, and a lack of basic hygiene products for detainees. The temporary restraining order mandates that ICE limit capacity to provide adequate space, ensure regular cleaning, and provide sleeping mats. The judge cited a "very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury" to the migrants being held in the facility.</p>

          <p>Residents in parts of Juneau, Alaska, are being urged to evacuate due to the threat of major flooding from a "glacial outburst." The phenomenon occurs when a lake dammed by glacial ice collapses, releasing a massive volume of water from the Mendenhall Glacier's Suicide Basin. This recurring event, which scientists say is exacerbated by climate change, has caused significant damage in previous years. Authorities have installed emergency barriers but are advising evacuation as a precaution, as the Mendenhall River is expected to crest at potentially record-breaking levels.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive cases. The change is intended to combat misinformation and increase transparency, particularly in situations with significant public interest. This move follows several cases where a lack of official information was blamed for fueling false rumors and social unrest. Decisions will still be made on a case-by-case basis, but the guidance aims to create more consistency and public trust.</p>

The report suggests that providing free bus travel, similar to an existing program in Scotland, could help address social exclusion and boost the economy.

The engineering giant, which has seen its share price increase tenfold recently, believes its unique nuclear capability gives it a massive advantage in this emerging trillion-dollar market.

Experts warn that the industry is approaching a point where it may lose the "critical mass" needed to sustain its supply chain and skilled workforce.
