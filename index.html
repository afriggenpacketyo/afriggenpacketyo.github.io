          <h2>Vogue Advertisement Featuring AI-Generated Model Sparks Debate on Beauty Standards</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Guess advertisement in Vogue magazine, featuring a flawless AI-generated model, has ignited controversy. Critics, including plus-size model Felicity Hayward, argue that this move undermines efforts toward diversity and promotes unrealistic beauty ideals, potentially harming consumers' mental health. The company behind the AI, Seraphinne Vallora, defends its creation as a complex process and another form of marketing, while admitting their more diverse AI images receive less engagement online. The debate highlights growing concerns over the lack of regulation and transparency for AI content in the fashion industry and its broader societal impact.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is attempting to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, a nearly 2,000-year-old seismoscope invented by polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as an urn with eight dragons, each holding a bronze ball, which would drop a ball into a toad's mouth below to indicate the direction of a distant earthquake. Despite its legendary status, some scholars have dismissed it, and it was even removed from Chinese school curricula in 2017. The new project, supported by modern science, aims to restore the ancient invention's reputation and understand its sophisticated mechanics.</p>

A partnership between Netflix, WWE, and Words + Pictures had been working on the film since the previous year, with Hogan himself contributing over 20 hours of interviews. This project provides a final opportunity for fans to gain an in-depth look at the life and career of the man born Terry Bollea.

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it will begin airdropping aid into Gaza and establish humanitarian corridors for UN convoys to address the escalating humanitarian crisis. This decision follows mounting international pressure and reports of numerous deaths from malnutrition and starvation. While Israel states these actions aim to refute claims of deliberate starvation, it also maintains that combat operations against Hamas will continue. Aid organizations, however, have expressed skepticism, with UNRWA's chief calling airdrops an inefficient "distraction" and reiterating the need for unrestricted land access to avert a full-blown famine.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study from the University of New Mexico has detected plastic particles in human brain tissue for the first time, raising significant concerns about long-term health. Researchers estimate the quantity could be equivalent to a plastic spoon and have found higher concentrations in the brains of individuals with dementia. These microscopic particles, or nanoplastics, enter the body through food, water, and air. Ongoing clinical studies are now linking these pollutants to a range of health issues, including hormonal problems, cognitive abnormalities, and cardiovascular disease, prompting calls for more stringent action on plastic use.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were evacuated after being stuck inside a tunnel for over six hours. The train suffered a power failure shortly after its journey began, causing it to stop and lose air conditioning and lighting. The rescue operation was prolonged when some passengers attempted to leave the tunnel on foot, forcing a secondary power-down for safety reasons. Ultimately, passengers were led out through emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus, with only two requiring on-site medical treatment.</p>

Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a platelet-rich plasma injection and is expected to miss 10 days to two weeks. He first felt the pain during a game against Toronto and hopes to return initially as a designated hitter once the strain has healed.</p>

The MTV show "The Osbournes," which also featured his wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack, pioneered the "reality sitcom" genre by blending mundane family life with rock-star celebrity. Before the Kardashians, the show captivated millions by portraying the Black Sabbath frontman as a lovable, bumbling father, creating a new format that heavily influenced future celebrity-driven reality programming.

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a recall effort, allowing them to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature and prolonging the island's political gridlock. The recall campaign targeted 24 lawmakers from the KMT and other opposition parties, accusing them of being "pro-China" and undermining national security. Since winning a parliamentary majority, the opposition has stymied President William Lai's agenda, including cutting defense budgets amid rising pressure from Beijing. The failure of the recall vote means President Lai will likely face an emboldened and adversarial parliament for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a "fantasist" and convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival from his mother's kitchen. The proposed "Monmouth Rising" festival falsely claimed a lineup including major bands like The Killers and Pulp, and boasted of being the world's first hydrogen-powered festival. Kenny managed to deceive industry insiders, employees, and suppliers with forged documents and false claims of investment. The scheme unraveled when he failed to pay employees and suppliers, leaving many out of pocket and highlighting the vulnerabilities within the festival industry to charismatic fraudsters.</p>

          <p>President Trump's weekend golfing trip to Scotland, his mother's homeland, was met with widespread protests across the country. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside his resorts and in cities like Edinburgh, chanting and holding signs critical of the U.S. president. Many Scots expressed disapproval of Trump, with one recent poll showing 71% hold an unfavorable opinion of him. Protesters also raised concerns about the cost to Scottish taxpayers for the major security operation during his private visit and questioned his connections to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, issues that have followed him overseas.</p>

The brutal crime drew international attention and heightened fears of anti-Muslim discrimination in the U.S. An advocate from the Council on American-Islamic Relations remarked that while the "depraved killer has died, the hate is still alive."</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas from Burbank, California, executed a sudden dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots of Flight 1496 received an onboard traffic alert about another aircraft, a decommissioned fighter jet, in their vicinity. The pilots responded immediately by rapidly descending to create a safe separation. While some passengers were jolted from their seats, no serious injuries were reported among them, though a flight attendant was hospitalized for minor injuries.

          <p>The Trump administration's broad use of tariffs is facing significant legal scrutiny, with a federal appeals court set to hear arguments challenging his authority. The lawsuits contend that President Trump has illegally used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose duties on various countries by declaring a national emergency. A lower court previously ruled against the administration, a decision that was paused pending appeal. The outcome of these cases could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs enacted by Trump, creating massive uncertainty for the U.S. economy and its international trade relationships.

During the visit, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects.

Stokes has a history of injury issues and had to retire hurt with cramp while batting on day three. His potential inability to bowl is a significant concern for England as they push for a victory, highlighting the team's reliance on their talismanic all-rounder's contributions with both bat and ball.</p>

          <p>CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig expressed astonishment at President Trump's response when asked if he would consider pardoning convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump stated he "hadn't thought about" a pardon, a reply Honig called an answer to "the easiest question in human history," for which the only correct response should be an emphatic "no." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. The president's non-committal answer has fueled further speculation and criticism amid ongoing questions about his past association with Epstein.</p>
