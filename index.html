          <p>A chaotic and fearful scene unfolded in Midtown Manhattan after a gunman opened fire in a Park Avenue office tower, killing four people and wounding another before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Shane D. Tamura, entered the building with an M4 rifle and began shooting, causing panic as people ran for cover and nearby buildings were placed on lockdown. The building, which houses the headquarters for the NFL and investment firm Blackstone, was quickly surrounded by a massive police presence. Witnesses described hearing loud bangs and seeing people flee, with the area remaining an active crime scene for hours.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike on a prison in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine has killed at least 17 inmates and wounded 42 others, according to Ukrainian officials. The overnight attack reportedly involved eight high-explosive aerial glide bombs, which destroyed several buildings within the Bilenke penitentiary complex. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, condemned the attack as a war crime, while Ukraine's human rights commissioner noted it was a gross violation of humanitarian law. The attack is part of a wider wave of Russian strikes, with additional casualties reported in the Dnipropetrovsk region and a deadly drone strike claimed by Ukraine in Russia's Rostov region.</p>

          <p>A group of 252 Venezuelan men, recently freed from El Salvador's "Cecot" maximum-security prison, have described their 125-day incarceration as a living nightmare filled with beatings and psychological abuse. The men were deported from the United States as part of the Trump administration's anti-immigration policies and held in the facility, which a warden reportedly called a "cemetery of the living dead." Detainees, many with no criminal background, recount being told they would die in the prison and were subjected to dehumanizing conditions, leading some to contemplate suicide. Their release was part of a prisoner swap, and some are now suing the U.S. government for their ordeal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of making improper political comments about President Donald Trump. The complaint alleges that during a closed-door meeting, Judge Boasberg questioned whether the Trump administration would obey court rulings, potentially triggering a "constitutional crisis." This action escalates a clash that began after Boasberg held the DOJ in contempt for deporting Venezuelan asylum seekers to a notorious El Salvador prison despite a court order. The DOJ is seeking a formal investigation and reassignment of the case, a move that Chief Justice John Roberts has previously rebuked as an attack on judicial independence.</p>

City authorities reported that 30 of the deaths occurred in the hard-hit outlying districts of Miyun and Yanqing, with four additional fatalities from a landslide in neighboring Hebei province. The storms dropped immense amounts of rain, with some areas recording over 21 inches of precipitation, leading to the release of water from a reservoir at its highest level since 1959. More than 80,000 people have been relocated in Beijing alone as the extreme weather destroyed roads, knocked out power, and washed away homes and vehicles.</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) shares fell over 8% after the carrier reported a 59% plunge in its first-quarter net profit, which dropped to S$186 million. The decline was largely attributed to losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex restructuring and suffering from reputational damage. SIA began including Air India's financials in its results following a merger with Vistara. While SIA's own operating performance remains relatively strong with healthy travel demand, analysts believe Air India will continue to be a near-term drag on the group's bottom line, alongside rising competition and operating costs.

Uribe, who faces up to 12 years in prison, is expected to appeal the ruling.

The lawsuit argues the policy is an unlawful misinterpretation of immigration law and a violation of due process rights, causing catastrophic harm to families.
