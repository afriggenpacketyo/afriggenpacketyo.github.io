          <h2>Fulbright Board Resigns, Alleging Trump Administration Interference</h2>

          <p>All twelve members of the Fulbright scholarship board resigned in protest, accusing the Trump administration of improperly meddling with the selection of award recipients for the international exchange program. The board members claimed the administration overruled their authority by denying awards to numerous individuals already chosen for study and teaching positions in the U.S. and abroad. They also stated that 1,200 approved foreign award recipients are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection. The board members felt that continuing to serve would legitimize unlawful actions and damage the program's integrity and America's credibility. The State Department dismissed these claims as a partisan political stunt. The article suggests the Trump administration's actions undermine the program's merit-based selection process and its independence from political influence. The resignations highlight concerns about academic freedom and the integrity of international exchange programs.</p>

          <p>Recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, targeting workplaces and homes, have led to widespread fear and protests within the community. The raids, reportedly spurred by a push from White House advisor Stephen Miller to increase arrests of undocumented immigrants, have expanded beyond those accused of violent crimes to include individuals working in vital sectors of the economy. The article highlights the story of JesÃºs Cruz, a car wash worker arrested during one of the raids, leaving his family in distress. Protests have erupted across the city, with clashes between demonstrators and federal agents, leading to hundreds of arrests and a curfew in some areas. The situation has created a climate of uncertainty and anxiety among the large undocumented population in Los Angeles, raising concerns about the administration's immigration policies and their impact on families and communities.</p>

          <p>Violence has flared in Northern Ireland for a third consecutive night, with the worst of the unrest occurring in Ballymena and spreading to other towns.

Police have been attacked with fireworks, bottles, and bricks, resulting in injuries to officers and multiple arrests. Officials have described the violence as racially motivated, targeting ethnic minorities and police officers. Additional police officers have been deployed to the affected areas, and investigations are underway to identify and prosecute those involved in the criminal behavior.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have reportedly been informed that Israel is prepared to initiate an operation within Iran, potentially escalating tensions in the Middle East. The United States anticipates that Iran might retaliate against American sites in neighboring Iraq, contributing to the State Department's recent advisory for non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq. Despite these concerns, President Trump's Middle East envoy is still scheduled to meet with Iran for further talks on the country's nuclear program. The Trump administration has been seeking a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but disagreements persist regarding uranium enrichment terms. The situation remains delicate as Israel has historically been skeptical of any deal with Iran.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing intense protests against President Trump's immigration policies, particularly those championed by Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide. The protests, sparked by increased ICE raids across the city, reflect deep-seated anxieties among the large immigrant population. Miller, who grew up in the Los Angeles area, has been a key figure in pushing for mass deportations and a maximal assertion of executive power. The article describes the protests as a microcosm of Los Angeles, with a mix of young Hispanic people, older liberals, and left-wing activists expressing their opposition to the administration's actions. The White House is reportedly monitoring the situation closely, and the imagery from the protests could potentially lead to the invocation of the Insurrection Act.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, known as Aukus, to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to increase its military spending. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the significance of the US review, emphasizing that it is standard for a new administration to reassess agreements. The Aukus pact, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines and enhance security cooperation among the three nations. Concerns exist about whether the US can meet its own submarine demands and whether Australia will use the submarines in alignment with US interests.</p>

While long-term capital spending is prioritized, day-to-day spending is limited, and potential council tax increases are expected to fund the police. The government's strategy involves patience and a willingness to make long-term investments despite the current economic challenges and volatile political landscape. This approach is a gamble that hinges on the electorate's willingness to accept short-term constraints for future benefits.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons, found in a Mongolian museum, represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T. rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, possessing early stages of features key to tyrannosaurs' dominance, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw. This discovery provides valuable insights into the evolution of tyrannosaurs and their transition to apex predators.</p>
