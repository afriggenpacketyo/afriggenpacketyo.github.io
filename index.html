          <p>A federal judge, appointed by Donald Trump, dismissed a Department of Justice lawsuit against the entire Maryland federal judiciary. The DOJ challenged a standing order that prevents the immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants for at least one day after they file a legal challenge. The judge, Thomas Cullen, called the administration's attacks on federal judges "unprecedented and unfortunate," ruling that the lawsuit presented a nonjusticiable dispute between co-equal branches of government and that the judges were absolutely immune. This decision underscores the judiciary's independence and directs the executive branch to use established legal avenues for its grievances.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook plans to sue President Donald Trump over her removal, her attorney announced. Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, which her lawyer claims lack factual or legal basis. The Federal Reserve Act mandates that a president can only fire a board member "for cause," typically malfeasance during their tenure. Cook asserts she will not resign and will continue her duties, setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court case regarding presidential authority over the Fed.</p>

          <p>DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed frustration with the Democratic Party, urging a more aggressive stance against President Trump, whom he labeled a "dictator-in-chief." Speaking at the DNC's summer meeting, Martin criticized Democrats for focusing on winning arguments rather than elections, advocating for a stronger fight against Trump's policies. Other Democrats echoed this sentiment, highlighting efforts to resist the administration's agenda and mobilize supporters. The article suggests a shift towards a more provocative and combative strategy within the party.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates, currently at 6.58% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are expected to see a negligible drop in September, even if the Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate. Experts anticipate more significant decreases towards the end of 2025, possibly nearing 6%, influenced by the bond market and broader economic slowdown. While lower rates could attract more homebuyers, increased demand might also push home prices up, creating a double-edged sword for prospective buyers. The article advises shopping around and maintaining a good credit score (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The CDC's "Tips From Former Smokers" advertising campaign, credited with sparking millions of quit attempts and saving billions in healthcare costs over 13 years, is set to end in September due to Trump administration program cuts. Public health advocates and former smokers, like Leslie Allison-Seei, who attributes her life to the campaign, express grave concerns that ending these effective, national ads will lead to more smoking-related deaths and increased healthcare expenses. The cuts are part of a larger overhaul of the CDC's chronic disease programs, potentially dismantling decades of tobacco control progress.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the Trump Pentagon is considering acquiring equity stakes in major defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin. This follows the U.S. government's recent $9 billion acquisition of 10% of Intel stock. Lutnick suggested a reevaluation of how the U.S. finances defense capabilities, claiming the current system is a "giveaway." Critics, including conservatives, warn that such moves could undermine free-market principles and introduce political rather than commercial considerations into corporate decisions, raising questions about government control over the private economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill" did not alter capital gains rates but introduced new deductions for 2025, potentially expanding eligibility for the 0% capital gains bracket. A temporary $6,000 tax break ($12,000 for married couples) for Americans aged 65 and over, in addition to standard deductions, can significantly reduce taxable income. This creates a "golden opportunity" for many investors to sell assets without incurring capital gains taxes.

          <p>Experts generally agree that adjusting your thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit (4-6 degrees Celsius) while away for several hours is the most energy-efficient and cost-saving approach for air conditioning. While turning the AC off completely can save money, it risks mold growth in humid climates and increased wear on the unit when restarting. Factors like climate, home insulation, and AC unit type influence optimal usage. Simple strategies like blocking sunlight and using ceiling fans can also significantly contribute to keeping homes cool and reducing energy consumption.</p>

Caterpillar bulldozers were cited for use in the destruction of Palestinian property, while the banks provided financial services for Israeli settlements in the West Bank, deemed illegal under international law.

The company faced collapse by September 7th without the restructure, which includes a significant cash injection of £90 million from private equity firm Gordon Brothers. The plan involves closing 68 unprofitable stores, streamlining its distribution network, and revamping product ranges with lower prices. Managing director Barry Williams stated the focus is now on stabilizing the business and returning to growth, while acknowledging the impact on employees affected by closures.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in central Oregon that destroyed four homes is stabilizing due to moisture, though challenges remain for firefighters. Meanwhile, California's Pickett fire, burning in Napa County, has charred 10 square miles but has so far spared famous vineyards, thanks to wind direction and firefighting efforts. The region is experiencing a heat advisory and potential thunderstorms, posing ongoing risks. Tragically, a contract firefighter died from a cardiac emergency battling a separate blaze in Montana, underscoring the dangers of the profession amid a heatwave across the western U.S. and prolonged wildfire seasons.</p>

Ibrahim, arrested at 15 for alleged rock-throwing, is suffering from deteriorating health, including scabies, and has lost significant weight. The coalition argues his detention violates international law and highlights the abusive conditions in Israeli military prisons. This organized pressure campaign underscores growing concerns about the U.S. government's response to the detention of dual citizens.</p>

Beyond milk, options include yogurt, cheese, calcium-fortified plant milks, fruit juices, and cereals. Tofu made with calcium and canned fish with bones like salmon or sardines are also excellent sources. Certain vegetables, such as kale, broccoli, and bok choy, contribute to calcium intake. Individuals concerned about their calcium levels, especially women, those with specific health conditions, or plant-based eaters, should consult a doctor about supplements, prioritizing natural food sources.</p>

While French political influence has waned, with troops largely withdrawn, economic ties, including supermarket chains and the CFA franc currency, persist.

          <p>The UK has "almost certainly" experienced its hottest summer on record in 2025, with a provisional mean temperature of 16.13C, surpassing the previous record from 2018. This trend aligns with evidence of summers becoming hotter and drier due to climate change. The summer featured prolonged and widespread heatwaves, including a June heatwave with highs above 33C and a stormy start to August with Storm Floris. While sunshine amounts were above average, rainfall varied, leading to hosepipe bans in parts of England, reflecting the complex impacts of changing weather patterns.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are increasingly delisting their properties rather than lowering asking prices, with delistings up 38% since early 2025, signaling frustration in a stagnant housing market. This trend, where 21 homes are delisted for every 100 new listings, could create a "deadlock" between buyers and sellers. While housing inventory is growing, high prices and mortgage rates deter buyers, leading to stagnant sales. Many sellers, comfortable with existing mortgage rates, are opting to wait for better market conditions rather than accept lower offers, especially after the pandemic-era price surges.</p>

Despite criticisms, the PSL's success led to a surge in pumpkin spice-flavored products.
