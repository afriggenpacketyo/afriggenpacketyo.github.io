          <p>Nepal's army has been deployed to patrol the streets of Kathmandu and has imposed an indefinite curfew following violent protests that led to the prime minister's resignation. The military intervention came after police were unable to control demonstrations, which were initially sparked by a social media ban and escalated into broader anti-corruption dissent, resulting in at least 19 deaths. With soldiers now guarding key government buildings, authorities are attempting to restore order after days of chaos that saw protesters set fire to official buildings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary in England and Wales has called for police to stop recording non-crime hate incidents, arguing that current legislation puts officers in a difficult position. Sir Andy Cooke stated that a distinction must be made between offensive speech and criminal acts, allowing for open discourse without fear of legal repercussions for expressing opinions. This recommendation follows public debate over police actions, including the controversial arrest of Graham Linehan, with the head of the Metropolitan Police echoing the need for more officer discretion and clearer laws.</p>

The court will hear arguments in November regarding duties imposed on imports from numerous countries, which lower courts found to be an overreach of presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration argued for an expedited timeline, warning that it could be forced to refund up to $1 trillion in collected tariffs if the rulings are upheld. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their continued purchases of Russian oil. This move is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, though it risks further destabilizing global trade relationships. The proposal follows a meeting between senior U.S. and EU officials and comes after a U.S.-Russia summit yielded little progress on securing a ceasefire, signaling a potential escalation in economic strategy.

          <p>Poland's air force, with allied support, scrambled jets and shot down several Russian drones that violated its airspace overnight in what the country's military command called an "unprecedented act of aggression." The incursion, which involved a "huge number" of drones, occurred during a large-scale Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine and prompted strong condemnation from NATO allies, including France and the European Commission. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that drones posing a direct threat were neutralized and that he is in constant communication with NATO leadership.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that China, rather than Russia, stands to gain the most from the proposed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline. Following Western sanctions that reduced its energy exports to Europe, Russia has become more reliant on China as a primary buyer, shifting the balance of power in negotiations. The analysis suggests that with Russia's share of EU gas imports plummeting, Moscow has limited alternatives, giving Beijing significant leverage to dictate terms and secure a favorable energy deal that serves its long-term strategic and economic interests.</p>

          <p>Despite a poor run of results in the Premier League, an analysis of underlying statistics suggests that Manchester United's performances under manager Ruben Amorim have been stronger than their point tally implies. The data shows the team has created a high volume of chances while conceding relatively few, ranking among the league's more dominant sides in their last 10 games. However, significant underperformance in both scoring goals and preventing them has been the primary issue, raising questions about player quality, confidence, or simply bad luck.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that a private security contractor in Gaza, UG Solutions, has employed members of a U.S. biker gang with a history of anti-Islamic hostility to guard humanitarian aid distribution sites. At least 10 members of the Infidels Motorcycle Club, which uses Crusader symbols and has hosted anti-Muslim rhetoric online, were identified in key security roles. The presence of this group has drawn sharp criticism from civil rights organizations, who argue that their involvement is inappropriate and dangerous in a region where hundreds of civilians have already been killed seeking aid.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index fell by 0.4% in August from a year earlier, a larger drop than economists had anticipated, signaling persistent deflationary pressures in the world's second-largest economy. While core inflation saw a slight uptick, the data reflects ongoing weak domestic demand and deepening price drops for consumer durables. The persistent decline in producer prices, now in its third year, has added to calls for Beijing to implement more robust fiscal support to stimulate the economy as export growth also weakens.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ruling that the move likely violates the Federal Reserve Act. Judge Jia Cobb stated that the law's "for cause" provision for removal pertains to a governor's conduct while in office, not actions that occurred before their appointment, such as the mortgage fraud allegations cited by the White House. The decision reaffirms the principle of Federal Reserve independence from political interference and allows Cook to continue her duties while her lawsuit proceeds.</p>

          <p>A new report from UNICEF reveals that for the first time, obesity has overtaken undernourishment as the leading form of malnutrition among school-aged children and adolescents globally. Since 2000, the rate of underweight children has declined, while obesity rates have nearly tripled, with one in five children now considered overweight. The report attributes this alarming trend to the proliferation of unhealthy food environments dominated by ultra-processed and fast foods, and calls for policy changes like better food labeling and restrictions on junk food in schools.</p>

          <p>The public release of a "birthday book" created for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 has provided a disturbing look into his social circle, containing tributes from powerful figures that appear to celebrate or joke about his predatory lifestyle. The document, which includes a controversial letter and sketch from Donald Trump, is described in the article as evidence that Epstein's behavior was an open secret among some elites. This analysis suggests the book confirms long-held suspicions about a culture of enablement surrounding Epstein's sex crimes against minors.</p>
