          <p>President Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top buyers of his meme coin, $TRUMP, at his Virginia golf club, where attendees spent a combined $148 million to be there. The event, attended by crypto influencers and executives, was criticized by some attendees for underwhelming food and a brief appearance by Trump. Lawmakers and regulators expressed alarm over the event, particularly regarding the top token holder, Justin Sun, who faces SEC fraud charges. The event also sparked protests and concerns about political infighting potentially derailing stablecoin legislation, crucial for U.S. competitiveness in digital payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a planned partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, aiming to keep U.S. Steel in America and create 70,000 jobs, adding $14 billion to the U.S. economy. This announcement follows the Biden administration's previous block of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel due to national security concerns. U.S. Steel will retain its headquarters in Pittsburgh. Investors reacted positively, with shares of U.S. Steel jumping 21% following the news, but the United Steelworkers union expressed caution, emphasizing the need for more information to assess the deal's impact on American jobs.</p>

The author emphasizes that Milgrim's legacy should not be co-opted or used for political gain by those seeking to exploit her death.

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the manhunt for escaped inmates in New Orleans has sparked controversy. While authorities credit the technology with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive, civil rights organizations and politicians from both parties have raised concerns about privacy and constitutional issues. The ACLU has called for an indefinite halt to the use of live-feed facial recognition, citing potential threats to fundamental rights and the risk of racially biased outcomes. The New Orleans Police Department had previously paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. until its compliance with legal requirements is ensured.</p>

          <p>A brush fire outside Yosemite National Park in California has led to the shutdown of a major highway and the evacuation of Mono City. The Inn fire has burned over 700 acres near Mono Lake. Highway 395 is closed due to safety reasons, including downed power lines. The fire is spreading slowly through sagebrush toward Mono City, with firefighting efforts focused on containment. Helicopters are using water from Mono Lake and Lundy Lake to combat the flames.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of a "planned partnership" with Japan-based Nippon Steel, which had sought to buy it.

The White House didn't immediately offer further clarification, and it was unclear who would own U.S. Steel under the arrangement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students. This move follows months of targeting Columbia, including suspending research funding. The administration alleges that Columbia breached Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The announcement formalizes previous accusations against Columbia, rather than signaling a new stage of the campaign against the university.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants in the United States, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and expedite approvals for new reactors. The Trump administration also set a goal of quadrupling the size of the nation’s fleet of nuclear power plants by 2050. The executive orders call on the secretary of energy to develop a plan to rebuild U.S. supplies of enriched uranium and other nuclear fuels.</p>
