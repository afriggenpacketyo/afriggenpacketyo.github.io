          <p>A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in the deaths of at least 14 people and injuries to dozens more, marking one of the deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in recent months. The strike, which lasted nearly nine hours, targeted residential buildings, including a nine-story apartment complex. Ukrainian officials reported that over 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched at the country, with emergency workers responding to rescue people from the rubble. The attack occurred as world leaders gathered for the Group of Seven meeting in Canada, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was expected to attend. The overall situation reflects an escalation in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent weeks. Optimism for immediate de-escalation is low given the intensity of the attacks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump departed the G7 summit early, citing the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran as the reason for his return to Washington. Trump urged Iranian civilians to evacuate Tehran and stated that the situation was "much bigger" than ceasefire talks. G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel while calling for de-escalation and condemning Iran for regional instability. The conflict has prompted increased military activity, with Israel claiming to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander, while China has offered to mediate. The G7 nations also addressed Trump's tariff policy and support for Ukraine, reflecting broader global economic and geopolitical challenges. The situation remains tense with uncertain prospects for a near-term resolution.</p>

          <p>During the G7 summit, President Donald Trump showcased a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump accidentally dropped the document and initially misidentified the agreement as being with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK, and Trump acknowledged that it was "not much" different from a previous agreement signed in May. The new agreement includes details on steel and aluminum, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick set to determine quotas for products entering the U.S. without tariffs, which demonstrates ongoing trade negotiations and agreements between the U.S. and the UK. This agreement is expected to produce jobs and income for both nations.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and Sendai in northeastern Japan were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that stalled between stations. JR East, the operator, halted services on the Tohoku shinkansen line, anticipating resumption around 7 p.m. The affected train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, causing two other trains to halt as well. This disruption highlights the importance of safety inspections and maintenance for high-speed rail transport. While inconvenient for travelers, the suspension is a precautionary measure to ensure passenger safety.</p>

The U.S. Capitol Police have investigated a rising number of concerning statements and direct threats against lawmakers in recent years.

          <p>Chris Woakes' return to the England squad for the Test series against India is seen as vital, particularly given his past performances and the team's reliance on him. At 36, Woakes is the oldest player in the squad and is expected to lead the bowling attack due to his accuracy and movement, which could trouble the Indian batting lineup. Woakes emphasizes the importance of being a "senior" bowler and supporting younger players.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace beyond April of next year, while maintaining its interest rate at 0.5%. This decision reflects a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties, particularly due to U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs impacting Japan's export-oriented economy. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. The BOJ's decision highlights the challenges of balancing policy normalization with global economic risks. (not investment advice)</p>
