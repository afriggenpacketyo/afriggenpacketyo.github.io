          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, has been placed on indefinite paid leave after a hearing regarding the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Reuveni, acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, was cited for a 'failure to zealously advocate' for the government's interests during the hearing. The judge in the case pressed Reuveni for details surrounding Abrego Garcia's deportation and the administration's inability to facilitate his return. The government is now seeking to appeal the judge's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the United States.</p>

His decision to transfer is a setback for USC's backcourt plans, though the team is expected to return Desmond Claude and add Alijah Arenas. Yates' departure reflects the evolving landscape of college basketball, with revenue sharing and NIL opportunities influencing player decisions. Jacob Cofie from Virginia has committed to USC.</p>

The editorial suggests that Starmer should prioritize resetting trade relations with the EU, rather than relying on a potentially unreliable trade deal with the US. The editorial highlights the risk of a global recession impacting the UK's economic growth and emphasizes the need for Labour to adhere to its progressive values when making difficult fiscal choices. A trade deal with the US may not protect the UK from the broader effects of a trade war.</p>

          <p>The author argues that Gen X men need to step up and teach their sons about healthy masculinity, rather than leaving them to be influenced by online manfluencers. She contends that the rise of toxic masculinity is partly due to Gen X men abdicating their responsibility to guide younger generations. She argues that men of this generation need to share the insights of their own experiences with sexuality and relationships, to guide the generations that follow them. The author stresses that women cannot be solely responsible for this task.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are questioning the formula behind President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff plan, asserting that it is based on flawed assumptions. The formula uses an elasticity rate that is lower than it should be, resulting in inflated tariff rates. A report from the Cato Institute also suggests that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than they are in reality. Adjusting the elasticity assumptions would significantly lower the tariff rates imposed on various countries.</p>
