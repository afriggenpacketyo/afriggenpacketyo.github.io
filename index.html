          <p>China's industrial profits increased for the second consecutive month in April, despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. The growth in profits, particularly in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors, signals resilience in the Chinese economy. While U.S. tariffs had initially increased significantly, recent agreements between Washington and Beijing have led to a reduction in these levies. However, some industries, like the automobile and apparel sectors, still face challenges due to price competition and shifting demand (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer, in response to rising inflation and hefty U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged the economic impact of the U.S. tariffs, especially on the auto industry, and pledged support for small and medium-sized companies. The subsidies are projected to reduce household energy bills, though critics suggest the measures are aimed at boosting government support ahead of the House of Councillors election (not investment advice).</p>

Despite Japan's net external assets rising to a record high, boosted by a weaker yen, Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets increased significantly, but were still below Germany's total. The United States, in contrast, had a net external liability, meaning its foreign debts exceeded its overseas assets (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>House Bill Targets Tax Break for Sports Team Owners</h2>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The legislation would affect future owners, limiting their ability to deduct the value of intangible assets like player contracts over 15 years. This measure aims to cool the frenzy among the wealthy to own sports teams and generate nearly $1 billion in revenue over a decade. Team owners insist the number is far higher, and the prospect of tax changes could spur accelerated sales or purchases.</p>

This stance clashes with the reality of global supply chains, where increased costs ultimately affect businesses and consumers.
