          <p>A hobbyist discovered a 4,270-year-old human skull on an Indiana riverbank, which forensic and radiocarbon analyses confirmed belonged to a Native American from around 2300 B.C. The Fayette County Coroner's Office is now coordinating with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma for repatriation and site management. This significant archaeological find underscores the region's ancient history and the importance of preserving cultural heritage. The ongoing government shutdown has temporarily halted efforts to identify the tribal affiliation.</p>

          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett predicted the government shutdown, now in its third week, is likely to conclude this week. He suggested that moderate Democrats might cooperate to reopen the government, allowing for negotiations on policy issues. Hassett also warned of "stronger measures" from the Trump administration if the impasse continues. Democrats, however, remain firm on including healthcare protections in any stopgap bill, with polls indicating public blame largely rests on the Trump administration and Republicans for the ongoing funding lapse.</p>

          <p>West Ham United is grappling with a 'toxic atmosphere' at London Stadium, marked by empty seats and fan protests against the club's leadership. Following a miserable 2-0 defeat, new manager Nuno Espirito Santo acknowledged the team's poor performance and the need to win back disillusioned supporters. Fans are protesting against chairman David Sullivan and vice-chair Karren Brady, citing unkept promises, inadequate squad strengthening, and a diminished matchday experience since the move from Upton Park. The club remains 19th in the league, facing a critical period to rebuild fan trust.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Western Perspective on China Risks War, Misinterpreting Its Historical DNA</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the West's current framework for viewing China, which predicts inevitable conflict based on historical Western power struggles, is a conceptual trap. Drawing on Graham Allison's "Thucydides Trap," the author contends that projecting a narrative of aggression onto China through a "mirror" of European and Japanese imperialism misunderstands China's unique 5,000-year history. China's cultural DNA is described as profoundly land-bound and defensive, shaped by geography to protect its agricultural heartlands rather than pursue outward conquest. The article urges the West to adopt a new perspective to avert potential conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's plan to double the ICE workforce is facing significant hurdles, primarily due to a high failure rate in the agency's personal fitness test. Over a third of new recruits have failed to meet minimum standards, impeding the goal of deploying 10,000 deportation officers. The article highlights concerns among veteran ICE officials about the quality of fast-tracked recruits and the easing of academy standards. Despite recruitment bonuses and incentives, the physical demands of the job, which often involve chasing and tackling individuals, are proving too challenging for many candidates, creating a "disaster" in staffing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC and/or CBD, are experiencing a surge in popularity as Americans increasingly opt for less alcohol. This trend is driven by consumer demand for nonalcoholic alternatives with fewer calories and no hangovers, particularly among women in their 30s and early 40s. THC beverage sales are projected to reach nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, with major retailers like Target testing sales. While offering social alternatives, doctors warn of potential side effects, including impacts on memory, focus, and mental health, underscoring the need for mindful consumption.

          <p>Decommissioned Confederate statues, including a massive monument of General Robert E. Lee, are now featured in a Los Angeles art exhibition titled "Monuments." Curated by Hamza Walker, the show displays melted-down bronze and graffitied equestrian statues alongside contemporary art, challenging the "Lost Cause" ideology that romanticizes Confederate figures. This initiative offers a counter-narrative to calls for reinstalling such monuments, emphasizing the racist history of slavery they represent. The exhibition aims to purify toxic historical representations and foster a critical re-evaluation of American history through artistic transformation.</p>

          <p>After two years of devastating conflict, Hamas is described as a "pale shadow" of its former self, with its leadership decimated and infrastructure severely damaged. Despite a ceasefire, masked Hamas men are reasserting authority in Gaza through violence against opponents, creating a nerve-wracking endgame for traumatized Gazans. While some aid workers see a need for order, others are skeptical of Hamas relinquishing power or weapons, even with a US peace plan proposing an international stabilization force.
