            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) addressed his recent trip to El Salvador, clarifying that it was to uphold the Constitution, not to defend Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported. Van Hollen emphasized that the Trump administration admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was wrongfully detained and deported. The senator asserted his mission is to ensure the rule of law is upheld, protecting due process rights for all individuals, as jeopardizing these rights for one person endangers them for everyone. The case underscores ongoing debates about immigration enforcement and constitutional protections.</p>

Beddington reflects on the spectrum of dating lies, from harmless fibs born of insecurity to egregious falsehoods that cause real harm. She questions whether all dating lies are awful, suggesting that some may stem from attempts at kindness or wishful thinking.</p>

            <p>A report from the Atlantic Council warns the United States to engage with the Global South to consolidate its position in the technological competition with China. Developing countries are expected to play an increasingly critical role in advanced technology, and their ties with China are likely to strengthen. The US cannot afford to be complacent and must avoid underestimating the Global South's role. Failure to do so would allow China to advance its geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.</p>

            <p>A former member of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Commission warns that the Trump administration's cuts to science, environmental, and safety agencies threaten to repeat past disasters. The dismantling of offshore drilling safety measures and the rollback of environmental regulations are particularly alarming. The administration's insistence that these actions will reduce bureaucratic burdens or spur economic growth is misleading, shifting the burden of risk onto communities and ordinary Americans. The former official urges a commitment to strong regulations, research, and adequate funding for agencies protecting health and resources.</p>

            <p>The article explores the ethical dilemma of tuning out political news for mental health, framing attention as an ethical resource. It discusses how modern technology and intentional political strategies can overwhelm our capacity for moral attention. The author suggests reclaiming attentional sovereignty by strategically withdrawing from the information environment and investing in training moral attention through practices like meditation.
