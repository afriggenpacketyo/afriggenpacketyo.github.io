          <p>A major power outage struck Spain and Portugal, impacting daily life as businesses closed and transportation systems such as trains, subways, and flights were disrupted. The outage affected tens of millions of people across the Iberian Peninsula. While officials have denied any foul play, the cause remains unclear, with Portuguese energy authorities citing a disruption in the European grid but dismissing reports of an atmospheric phenomenon. The situation highlights the vulnerability of interconnected energy systems and the potential for widespread disruption. Relevant context is the reliance of modern society on electricity and the potential for cascading failures in interconnected systems.</p>

The OCR demands the university restore all female athletes' records and issue an apology for the discrimination they faced due to male athletes competing in female categories, which stems from Lia Thomas' participation on the women's swim team during the 2021-22 season.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Salah's selfie celebration after scoring a goal for Liverpool against Tottenham Hotspur has become an iconic moment, but it has also sparked debate.

          <p>Temu has added 'import charges' of approximately 145% after President Trump's tariffs, significantly increasing the price of many items. These fees, which began appearing after recent price hikes, often exceed the cost of the products themselves, more than doubling the price of a typical order. The company cites changes in global trade rules and tariffs as the reason for the adjustments. This move erodes Temu's value proposition, which previously attracted consumers with low prices, potentially aligning its prices with competitors like Amazon and Walmart.</p>

          <p>Damian Lillard of the Milwaukee Bucks may miss most or all of the 2025-26 NBA season after reportedly suffering a torn left achilles tendon.

          <p>Apollo Global Management forecasts a recession this summer due to the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. The timeline suggests that US consumers could face shortages next month, followed by a halt in trucking demand, layoffs in trucking and retail, and ultimately a recession. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has acknowledged that the tariff standoff with Beijing is unsustainable. While some analysts believe a recession is likely, Bessent anticipates a "detox period" for the economy rather than a full-blown recession.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump is expected to sign an executive order targeting sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with immigration authorities. The order directs the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to identify these jurisdictions. The executive order could lead to more federal lawsuits against cities and states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Previous attempts to withhold funding from sanctuary cities have been challenged in court.</p>
