            <p>Sanya, a resort city in Hainan, China, is experiencing a surge in Russian tourists, with Russian language becoming more prevalent than English in some areas. The number of Russian visitors has increased dramatically in the past year, aiding the local travel sector's recovery from the pandemic. This upswing is attributed to a general recovery in Russian outbound tourism and China's relaxed visa policies aimed at attracting more foreign travelers. In 2024, China implemented rules allowing citizens of 59 countries to spend up to 30 days in Hainan without a visa, further boosting tourism.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily stopped the deportation of Venezuelan detainees, invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president to detain and deport citizens of "enemy" nations. A civil liberties group is challenging the deportations, arguing that the detainees were not informed of their right to contest the decision in court and were given notices in English despite some speaking only Spanish. The Trump administration has been using this act to expel Central and South Americans accused of gang affiliations, including deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador. The Supreme Court's order prevents the government from removing any detainees until further notice.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring US bond markets due to volatility sparked by trade tariffs. A rare sharp rise in bond rates and a fall in bond prices indicate a loss of confidence in the US economy. This volatility is linked to uncertainty over the impact of tariffs, leading investors to demand higher returns for perceived risk. Higher government borrowing rates can affect public spending, mortgages, credit cards, and business loans, potentially hindering economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump is using El Salvador's repressive state model as a blueprint for his own policies, particularly in immigration. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele's iron-fist crackdown against gangs, criticism, and political opposition serves as inspiration. Trump's policies build on Bukele's approach, leveraging anti-establishment anger to justify authoritarian measures. This alliance has led to the internationalization of the Bukele method, where civil liberties are suspended in the name of security, resulting in human rights violations and a chilling culture of fear.</p>

The ACLU also raised concerns that detainees were being accused of gang membership without due process, potentially leading to life sentences in El Salvador.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has cautioned that tariffs could provide corporations with excuses to price-gouge consumers, even on goods not directly affected by the tariffs. Experts suggest that the expectation of rising prices could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, giving companies cover to increase profit margins. The impact on US consumers is expected to be significant, with some economists forecasting inflation could reach 4% this year. (not investment advice)</p>
