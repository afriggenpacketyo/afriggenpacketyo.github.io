          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have issued a forceful report reaffirming that the dangers of climate change are "beyond scientific dispute." This publication directly challenges the Trump administration's efforts to revoke the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," which classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat requiring regulation under the Clean Air Act. The report states that scientific evidence supporting the 2009 finding has only grown stronger, highlighting the increasing risks the U.S. faces from climate-induced harm and future environmental extremes.</p>

          <p>U.S. tennis star Taylor Townsend has issued a public apology after receiving backlash for social media posts criticizing unfamiliar foods offered at a tournament in Shenzen, China. Townsend had expressed shock at seeing dishes such as bullfrogs and turtles, which led to accusations of cultural insensitivity from many on Chinese social media. In a subsequent video, the top-ranked doubles player sincerely apologized, stating her comments were not representative of her positive experience in the country and that she is privileged to experience different cultures through her travels.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming book, Kamala Harris reveals that her first choice for a running mate in the 2024 election was Pete Buttigieg, but she ultimately decided against it, viewing a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man as "too big of a risk." Harris writes that she believed Buttigieg would have been an ideal partner but felt the combination of their identities was asking too much of the American electorate at the time. She instead selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a decision that this article suggests highlights a broader debate within the Democratic party about prioritizing electability over historic candidacies.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an anticipated interest rate cut, which Chairman Jerome Powell described as a precautionary move for risk management. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was poised for a lower opening. The Fed's decision has shifted attention to other central banks, with the Bank of Japan expected to maintain its current policy rates during its upcoming two-day meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision has drawn criticism from some faculty members, who express concern that the equipment will be used against student protesters, citing recent clashes over pro-Palestinian encampments and a perceived chilling effect on free speech.</p>

While Gabrielle is expected to strengthen and could potentially reach hurricane status over the weekend as it passes north of the Caribbean, its long-term path remains uncertain.

The rate reflects the situation in 2024, where approximately 7 million residents could not meet their basic needs. The report attributes the persistently high rate to the expiration of pandemic-era anti-poverty programs, such as the federal child tax credit, which had helped lower the state's poverty to a historic low in 2021. Researchers warn that recent state and federal budget cuts could exacerbate the problem further.</p>

          <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to maintain the current interest rate of 4% when they meet on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe further cuts are unlikely for the remainder of the year, as official data shows UK inflation remains at 3.8%, nearly double the central bank's 2% target. The decision contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which recently cut its rates, highlighting different economic pressures facing the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old man, Blake Francis Rogers, has been arrested in Summit County, Utah, for allegedly making a threat of terrorism against Utah Valley University.

Authorities were alerted by the FBI to a video Rogers posted online in which he allegedly made specific threats of violence against the university. Rogers reportedly told investigators that the video, sent to a small group of people, was intended as a "joke." The incident has heightened tensions on the campus as students mourn Kirk's death.</p>

The Fed's decision to cut rates was explained by Chairman Jerome Powell as a response to growing signs of weakness in the U.S. labor market.
