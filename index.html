          <p>An annual California contest celebrating unique canine beauty named a dog called Petunia as its winner. The event, running for nearly 50 years, awarded $5,000 to the champion and highlights the value of adopting dogs from shelters and puppy mills. Organizers describe the contest as a testament to the idea that a dog's pedigree does not define its worth. The competition showcases pageantry and pride among owners of unconventionally beautiful dogs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy is meeting with Qatar's prime minister to advance a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The framework reportedly includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a complete Israeli military withdrawal from the territory. This diplomatic effort comes amid widespread international condemnation of Israel's announced plan for a military takeover of Gaza City.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that any peace deal negotiated directly between the U.S. and Russia without Ukraine's involvement would be a "dead solution." He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not concede land to end the conflict. His comments follow the announcement of a planned bilateral meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which has raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies that their interests could be marginalized. Several European leaders issued a joint statement reinforcing that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine.</p>

This news alleviated investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on the company's profitability.

The government argues this will save taxpayer money and enhance public safety, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population.

          <p>A coalition of approximately 20 countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, has jointly condemned Israel's plan to launch a new military offensive to seize control of Gaza City. In a joint statement, the nations described the move as a "dangerous and unacceptable escalation" and a "flagrant violation of international law." The plan, approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, has been widely criticized internationally and has reportedly faced warnings from within Israel's own military leadership. The condemnation highlights growing regional opposition to Israel's wartime strategies.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, dubbed the Canyon Fire, has forced thousands of residents in Southern California to evacuate. The fire, which started Thursday near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, has grown to nearly 5,400 acres. A firefighter sustained serious injuries when his truck rolled over a steep hillside while battling the blaze. Favorable overnight weather conditions allowed crews to make progress, reaching 28% containment by Saturday morning, but high temperatures forecast for the coming days mean residents must remain on high alert.</p>

          <p>President Trump is framing himself as a "peacemaker-in-chief," but faces significant challenges in his efforts to negotiate ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Despite some successes in brokering other international ceasefires, breakthroughs in these two major conflicts have been elusive. His approach to the Ukraine war is culminating in a high-stakes, one-on-one summit with Vladimir Putin, which excludes Ukraine and has drawn criticism. In Gaza, his administration's support for Israel is being strained by the worsening humanitarian crisis, even as talks for a hostage-release deal have stalled.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad is returning to his leadership role at the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research just over a week after he left the position. His initial departure followed intense criticism from far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who targeted him over the agency's handling of a controversial gene therapy. Prasad, a former critic of COVID-19 mandates, was appointed in May. An HHS spokesperson confirmed that Prasad was returning at the FDA's request, a move that Loomer immediately condemned on social media.</p>

          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Bollywood film industry has evolved significantly over the decades, reflecting the region's changing political landscape. Once portrayed as a romantic, idyllic paradise, Kashmir's image in cinema shifted dramatically with the rise of armed insurgency in the late 1980s. Films began to depict a militarized conflict zone, often aligning with Indian nationalist perspectives. Recent movies like "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370" reflect the current government's narrative, sparking debate over whether they offer a balanced view or reinforce sectarian divides.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denies any conspiracy to ruin her predecessor, Alex Salmond, and accuses him of destructive behavior. She writes that Salmond was willing to damage the Scottish National Party and democratic institutions rather than see them succeed without him. Sturgeon recounts her shock at the sexual misconduct allegations against him and her refusal to intervene in the investigation, which she says led to the "mortal political combat" that destroyed their partnership. Salmond was cleared of criminal charges in 2020 but died in 2024.</p>

Trump's focus on D.C. crime comes despite official statistics showing that violent crime rates have dropped significantly in the city over the past year.</p>
