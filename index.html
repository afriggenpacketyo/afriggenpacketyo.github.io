          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment (NCA) report, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) are soliciting research to maintain the report's momentum. The NCA report is crucial for projecting future climate impacts and informing decision-making related to infrastructure and disaster preparedness. Despite the administration's efforts to slash funding and eliminate offices responsible for the report, these scientific organizations aim to fill the gap and ensure that climate science continues to advance. The previous NCA report in 2023 highlighted the detrimental effects of climate change on health and well-being.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform known for ultra-discounted items, has altered its U.S. business model in response to the Trump administration's termination of the de minimis rule and increased tariffs on China. The company is now focusing on products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses, as items shipped directly from China are labeled as out of stock. A Temu spokesperson stated that this change aims to improve service levels and help local merchants reach more customers, while maintaining unchanged pricing for U.S. shoppers. Before the change, shoppers faced import charges of 130% to 150% on items shipped from China.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson is on trial in Australia, accused of poisoning her estranged husband's relatives with death cap mushrooms, resulting in three deaths. Patterson served a beef Wellington dish containing the poisonous mushrooms during a lunch in July 2023. Prosecutors allege Patterson lied about a cancer diagnosis as a pretense for the lunch, deliberately poisoned her guests, and feigned illness afterward to cover up her actions. Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming the incident was a tragic accident, and her lawyer states she did not intend to cause harm. She admits to lying to police about foraging for mushrooms but denies seeking out death cap mushrooms specifically.</p>

          <p>Amidst the largest measles outbreak in 25 years, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will direct federal agencies to explore new measles treatments, including vitamins, despite the measles vaccine's proven 97 percent effectiveness. This decision has sparked criticism from experts who fear it will undermine public confidence in vaccines. They argue that resources should be focused on promoting vaccination rather than untested treatments. Doctors in West Texas have reported that Kennedy's focus on treatments has led some patients to delay critical medical care in favor of unproven supplements, and some children with measles were given toxic levels of vitamin A.</p>

Communication with the city has been largely cut off, making independent verification difficult. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have attacked Nahud, which had been held by the Sudanese military. The UN human rights chief has stated that at least 542 civilians have been killed in the region in just three weeks, adding that the real toll is likely much higher.</p>

The surge in gold prices coincides with President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, which have shaken financial markets and threaten to reignite inflation. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that the economic outlook for the world, including the United States, has worsened due to Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty they have created.

          <p>The US and Ukraine have established a joint reconstruction investment fund aimed at attracting global investment into Ukraine. The agreement consists of 10 pages and does not mention any Ukrainian debt obligations to the US. The fund will invest in projects for extracting fossil fuels, oil, and gas, as well as related infrastructure or recycling. Kyiv will contribute 50% of revenues from new licenses for extracting raw materials to the fund. Experts believe that investment can only be expected after the end of the "hot phase" of Russia's war against Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry spoke to the BBC about returning to the UK, his relationship with his family, and his anger at losing his right to automatic security protection. He said that any prospect of a return to the UK for his family is "impossible" given the court ruling. He also said there had been "so many disagreements" in the family, but the "only thing that's left" is the row over his security. Harry claimed the downgrading of his security arrangements in 2020 was used as "leverage" over him after his decision to step down from front line royal duties.</p>

However, it is simultaneously undermining the demand for those minerals by cutting federal programs that support clean-tech manufacturing. This creates a paradox where the country is boosting mineral production while reducing its main destinations. Companies are already scrapping plans for clean-energy projects due to policy changes, and experts warn that without a clear demand signal, no mining company will invest in domestic mineral production.</p>
