          <p>Despite recent military strikes between India and Pakistan, Indian markets have demonstrated resilience, driven by strong domestic demand, structural reforms, and robust macroeconomic fundamentals. Investors remain optimistic about India's growth prospects, outweighing geopolitical fears. Progress in trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K., further supports market confidence. Experts anticipate some short-term volatility but expect a gradual recovery unless the conflict escalates significantly, noting historical precedents where markets remained stable despite heightened tensions.

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a 5% increase following the announcement that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the latter half of 2025. This projection comes as the availability of compounded alternatives is set to decrease. Despite reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales due to competition from these compounded drugs, the company anticipates a rebound once the FDA's drug shortage ruling is lifted, allowing for greater market share. The launch of a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and strategic partnerships with telehealth providers are also expected to bolster Wegovy's accessibility and sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a newly-agreed trade deal with India that includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties argue that this exemption could disadvantage British workers, as it may be cheaper to employ Indian workers. However, the government maintains that the deal will not impact British workers and points to existing agreements preventing double taxation. The trade deal aims to boost trade between the two countries by making it easier for UK firms to export goods and cutting taxes on Indian exports to the UK.</p>

The joint air training exercise between China and Egypt is seen as an indicator of potential arms sales. A Chinese analyst noted that inviting a foreign pilot to sit in the back seat of the J-10S signals mutual trust and friendship between the two militaries.

          <p>Recent reports and films promoting the idea that cattle and sheep farming are environmentally beneficial are facing scrutiny and criticism. These claims, often backed by the meat industry, are being called a form of climate-science denial due to the land-intensive and climate-damaging nature of beef and lamb production. Critics point out flawed methodologies and omitted measurements in these reports, emphasizing that grazing livestock contributes to deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and the destruction of ecosystems. It is suggested that these claims are industry lobbying efforts that romanticize farming while obscuring the true environmental costs.</p>

Trump's executive order mandating digital payments to and from the U.S. government has fueled fears that Americans could be forced to adopt cryptocurrencies.

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson is facing a lawsuit from four former housekeepers who allege sexual assault and a hostile work environment. The women, identified as Jane Does, claim Robinson subjected them to sexual battery, false imprisonment, and gender violence over several years. The lawsuit also names Robinson's wife, Frances, accusing her of contributing to the hostile environment. The women are seeking $50 million in damages, citing the singer's reputation as an intimidating factor that made them feel powerless to report the alleged abuse.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a decline in the number of teenage boys actively participating in football, prompting the German FA (DFB) to initiate reforms aimed at modernizing the sport and making it more attractive to young people. The DFB is focusing on creating a fun, inclusive environment that prioritizes participation over results. Proposed changes include adapting training concepts and game formats to better engage young players. The reforms aim to combat factors contributing to the decline, such as the rise of digital platforms, the cost of playing organized football, and high expectations.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Anchoring Normalizes Trade Protectionism</h2>

          <p>President Trump's approach to tariffs, characterized by proposing high tariffs and then scaling them back, has normalized significant trade protectionism, according to the article. This tactic, known as anchoring, has reset expectations, making existing tariffs seem less severe. While investors have embraced signs of good news, the implemented tariffs still constitute a significant tax increase for consumers and could harm businesses. Despite potential trade negotiations with China, the United States may need to make substantial tariff cuts to meaningfully restart trade.</p>
