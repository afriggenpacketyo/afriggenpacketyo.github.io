          <p>The UK punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is facing condemnation and a police review after leading anti-Israel chants during their performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The singer shouted "Death to the IDF" and led the crowd in other chants, prompting an outcry from political officials and festival organizers, who called the statements appalling hate speech. The BBC, which broadcast the festival, has since removed the duo's set from its streaming service and issued an on-screen warning during the live feed. Organizers have reiterated that there is no place for antisemitism or incitement to violence at the event.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and another person was injured in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being ambushed by a shooter while responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain. Authorities reported taking sniper fire from high-powered rifles, prompting a multi-agency manhunt and a shelter-in-place order for the area. A SWAT team later discovered a deceased male with a firearm nearby, believed to be the suspect. Officials are investigating whether the fire was deliberately set to lure first responders into the attack, which Idaho's governor condemned as a heinous assault.</p>

          <p>The jury has begun deliberations in the trial of Erin Patterson, an Australian woman accused of murdering three relatives with a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. Prosecutors allege she knowingly served the toxic fungi in a beef Wellington lunch in July 2023 and then lied to police, while the defense claims it was an accidental poisoning and she lied out of panic. Patterson's in-laws and an aunt died, while an uncle survived after being in a coma. The judge instructed the jury to base their verdict on facts, not sympathy or moral judgment about her lies.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax that would have affected major U.S. technology companies. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada in response to the proposed 3% levy. Ottawa stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade arrangement, allowing negotiations to resume ahead of a previously set timeline. The tax, enacted last year, would have applied retroactively and was set to be collected this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article from the South China Morning Post argues that Russia's status as a superpower is diminishing, as evidenced by its muted response to recent attacks on its ally, Iran. The author suggests that Moscow's preoccupation with its war in Ukraine has severely weakened its military and financial capacity to support its international partners, including those in Syria and Armenia. Instead of providing military aid to Iran during its conflict with Israel, Russia positioned itself as a neutral mediator. This pattern of strategic neglect undermines the Kremlin's credibility and its proclaimed anti-Western alliance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers attribute to the vehicles' unique acceleration and braking characteristics. Studies from Chinese and Hong Kong universities indicate that the smooth, rapid acceleration and the regenerative braking systems in EVs can provoke queasiness. Regenerative braking, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, causes a low-frequency deceleration that is a key trigger for motion sickness symptoms. This issue presents a new challenge for automakers in ensuring passenger comfort in the new era of transportation.</p>

Tillis opposed Trump's major tax and spending bill, citing devastating Medicaid cuts for his state, which prompted Trump to threaten support for a primary challenger against him. In his retirement announcement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating that independent thinkers are becoming an "endangered species."

This contradicts more forceful claims from the Trump administration that the facilities were "obliterated."

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has expressed concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to the demanding schedule. The tournament, set to take place in the United States, will leave some players with minimal rest before it begins and a compressed recovery period afterward. Guardiola acknowledged the strain on players but stated that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by governing bodies like FIFA and UEFA. He noted that while he understands the criticism of the calendar, teams not participating would likely love the income and exposure.</p>

          <p>Police in Istanbul detained more than 50 people who attempted to participate in an LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which has been banned by Turkish authorities for the tenth consecutive year. The governor of Istanbul had prohibited the event, claiming it undermines social peace and family values. Despite a heavy police presence designed to prevent large gatherings, activists clashed with officers while holding rainbow flags. This crackdown occurs amid increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, which human rights groups warn is fostering a hostile and discriminatory environment.</p>

The events underscored a dual purpose: joyful resistance and a continued fight for rights and inclusion. This year's demonstrations occurred ten years after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, a milestone celebrated amid new challenges.</p>

          <p>A female prosecutor in Osaka, Japan, has brought public attention to her case after accusing her former boss, a chief prosecutor, of sexual assault in 2018. The prosecutor, using the pseudonym Hikari, alleges she was silenced by the organization and slandered by a colleague after the incident, which left her with PTSD. While the accused was indicted and initially admitted to the charge, he has since recanted and pleaded not guilty, stalling the trial. This case is part of a growing "MeToo" movement in Japan, highlighting the challenges victims face within established power structures.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust regulator is preparing to fine Harley-Davidson's Japanese unit approximately 200 million yen ($1.4 million) for violating antimonopoly laws. The Japan Fair Trade Commission found that the company imposed excessive sales quotas on its dealers, pressuring them by implying their contracts would not be renewed if targets were not met. This pressure allegedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to meet the quotas. In addition to the fine, the commission will issue a cease and desist order to prevent the practice from continuing.</p>

Prime Minister Ishiba has called securing a majority a "must-attain" goal for his government.

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant, a move Beijing strongly opposed. The two nations had agreed in May to begin the process of resuming trade, and the lifting of the ban marks a significant step in de-escalating the diplomatic and economic friction over the issue. However, it may still take several months for procedural steps to be completed before physical shipments of seafood from Japan to China can resume.</p>

At least 30 writers, mostly women in their 20s, have been arrested since February for publishing their work on Haitang, a Taiwan-based platform. The writers face potential prison sentences of over 10 years, as well as social stigma after being outed by police investigations. This move is seen by observers as part of a broader campaign by Beijing to enforce traditional family values and censor subversive content.</p>
