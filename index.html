          <p>AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender athlete in California, won two track events over the weekend, tying for first place in both the high jump and triple jump. This occurred amidst widespread political attacks from right-wing figures and the Trump administration, who threatened to withhold federal funding from California for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls’ sports. The California Interscholastic Federation recently changed its rules to award the same place and medal to the athlete finishing behind a transgender athlete in a girls’ event. Hernandez's participation has drawn national attention, with the Justice Department investigating the federation and school district for potential sex-discrimination law violations.</p>

Roth acknowledged criticisms of higher education, such as a lack of intellectual diversity, but argued that improvements should come through convincing faculty and students, not through conforming to the ideology of those in power. He also addressed the issue of antisemitism on college campuses, stating that attacking universities is not a genuine attempt to defend Jewish students.</p>

Separately, railway bridges collapsed in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk regions, with officials suggesting Ukrainian involvement, though Ukrainian intelligence disputed these claims.</p>

          <p>White House budget director Russ Vought dismissed fears that cuts to benefits in the spending bill passed by the House will lead to premature deaths as “totally ridiculous”. The bill proposes cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Critics, including advocacy groups and Democratic senators, argue that these cuts will cause great hardship and potentially lead to more deaths. Vought defended the bill, claiming it will preserve and protect programs while reducing fraud, waste, and abuse.</p>

          <p>Germany's chief of defense, Gen. Carsten Breuer, warned that NATO members need to prepare for a possible attack from Russia within the next four years, suggesting that Russia is building up its forces to an "enormous extent." Breuer stated that Russia is producing approximately 1,500 main battle tanks every year and emphasized the need for NATO to ramp up its military capabilities and deterrence. He cited attacks on undersea cables, cyber attacks, and unidentified drones as examples of Russia testing NATO's defenses. Breuer insisted that NATO remains unified despite differing perspectives among European states on the threat of a possible Russian attack.</p>
