        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent budget bill has significantly increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, which offer tax-deferred and tax-exempt growth for qualified educational expenses. The definition of "qualified expenses" has been expanded beyond traditional higher education to include costs for vocational programs, required continuing education, and professional licensing preparation. This change aims to alleviate parental concerns about unused funds, as the accounts now support a wider range of career paths and even allow a portion of leftover money to be rolled into an IRA. The article suggests considering state tax benefits, investment options, and fees when choosing a plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 14:43:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest month in its 117-year history, processing over one million container units in July as shippers rushed to import goods ahead of tariff deadlines. This surge in activity, described as 'front-loading,' highlights the significant impact of trade policy on supply chain behavior, though it has created an unusually early and less intense peak season. Experts note that while import volumes soared, the market is now seeing a pullback, particularly in retail and lower-cost items, leading to a sharp decline in spot freight rates. This economic pressure is disproportionately affecting small and medium-sized importers whose profit margins are eroded by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A European Commission proposal to penalize Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza remains deadlocked due to a lack of consensus among EU member states, with Germany among those requesting more time for review. The plan, which would restrict Israeli startups from accessing EU research funds, was proposed in response to what the Commission called violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Despite warnings of an unfolding famine in Gaza, the bloc is divided on how to respond, with some nations like Spain advocating for a full suspension of the EU-Israel pact, while others prefer more targeted trade measures. This diplomatic impasse highlights the EU's ongoing struggle to form a unified policy on the conflict.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 14:37:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League has projected a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026, based on the latest inflation data. This estimate is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase received in 2025, which raised the average retiree's monthly payment by about $49. The Social Security Administration will finalize the official COLA in October using inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists express concern that this moderate adjustment may not be sufficient to cover potential price increases later in the year, partly due to pressure from tariffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The appointment of E. J. Antoni as the new head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is raising alarms about the potential politicization of crucial economic data. Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist with limited scholarly credentials, was named to the position after President Trump fired the previous director, a career economist, for producing 'bad numbers.' Critics, including conservative economists, worry that this move prioritizes political loyalty over expertise, potentially undermining the credibility of vital statistics like the monthly jobs report. Such a loss of trust could have severe consequences, as reliable data is essential for Federal Reserve decisions and maintaining international investor confidence in the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump offered a dismissive reaction to a report indicating Russia was at least partially behind a hack of the U.S. federal courts' electronic document system. When asked about the breach, which reportedly compromised sealed records, Trump remarked, 'Are you surprised?' and stated that hacking is what Russia does, adding that the U.S. is 'actually better at it.' The revelation of the long-term cyber intrusion comes just days before a scheduled meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war in Ukraine. Trump mentioned that he 'could' bring up the security breach during their discussion.</p>

Both offer liquidity and higher returns than traditional savings, with top money market accounts currently offering a slightly better rate, potentially earning about $25 more over a year on a $50,000 deposit. However, since both have variable rates, these earnings could change if the Federal Reserve adjusts its benchmark rate.

          <p>A new analysis of an Incan khipu, a knotted cord device for record-keeping, reveals its primary strand is made of human hair, challenging previous assumptions about their creation. Researchers determined the hair's owner had a diet of common foods like legumes and tubers, rather than the meat and maize beer typical of the ruling class. This discovery suggests that khipu literacy and production were not exclusive to elites but were also practiced by lower-status commoners in the vast empire. The finding helps bridge the gap between ancient imperial khipus and more modern versions used by peasant laborers, providing a new perspective on Incan society independent of Spanish colonial accounts.</p>

This article suggests that public anger and political polarization surrounding COVID-19 are being leveraged to advance a wider anti-vaccine agenda.

Researchers used ancient DNA, fossils, and computer models to find that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses an unprecedented threat. The North American population could plummet by up to 80% unless significant cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are made. The decline of these animals, which are crucial for maintaining tundra plant diversity, could have cascading ecological effects, including the release of carbon stored in Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>Severe weather in Tennessee, characterized by heavy rain and flooding, has led to a tragic incident in the Chattanooga suburb of East Ridge. A mother, father, and their child died when a large tree, its roots loosened by saturated ground, fell and crushed their car shortly after midnight. The widespread flooding has prompted numerous rescues of individuals trapped in their homes and vehicles, leading the Hamilton County mayor to declare a local state of emergency. A search is also underway for a man who went missing after walking into a flooded road.</p>

While the financial terms of the proposed sale were not disclosed, the team was recently valued at $3.65 billion. Dundon, a Dallas-based businessman and chairman of Dundon Capital Partners, is also a major owner in professional pickleball. The purchase, which is subject to NBA approval, would transfer ownership from Jody Allen, who has managed the team since her brother's death in 2018.</p>

Zayas notes his character has shifted from a trusting friend to a dubious investigator, driven by the one case that has always haunted him. His pursuit of justice creates a tense cat-and-mouse game, raising questions about whether Batista will survive his quest for the truth.</p>

Counter Terrorism Policing North East stated the charges, which also include unauthorized possession of a knife, follow a thorough investigation.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers are considering debt relief, but negotiating directly with creditors requires careful preparation. This article outlines three key considerations for those attempting a DIY approach: being persistent and prepared with documentation of financial hardship, understanding complex debt laws and negotiation strategies, and being aware of potential tax and credit score consequences. While handling negotiations personally can save on fees charged by professional services, a lack of knowledge can lead to unfavorable agreements or unexpected financial repercussions, such as a large tax bill on forgiven debt.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued an apology after a contributor on its Radio 4 'Thought for the Day' segment accused Conservative politician Robert Jenrick of 'xenophobia.' Theologian Dr. Krish Kandiah criticized a newspaper article in which Jenrick expressed concern about his children living near 'men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally.' Jenrick responded by saying the broadcast implied that parents concerned about illegal migration are racist. The BBC stated that while the reflection was broadly appropriate for the segment, 'some of the language it used went beyond that,' and temporarily removed the episode from its catch-up service for editing.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the historical shift in the Republican party's stance on environmental issues, from Richard Nixon's creation of the EPA to the current administration's pro-business approach. It notes that President Trump, much like Nixon in private conversations with auto executives, expresses sympathy for business complaints about the costs of environmental regulations. This political climate is forcing environmentalists to rethink their strategies, navigating an administration that views some of them as 'enemies of the system.' The brief piece highlights the tension between stated environmental goals and the practical pressures of political and economic interests under the current leadership.</p>

This trend coincides with the Trump administration resuming collection activities that were paused during the pandemic, including the potential for garnishing wages and Social Security benefits. Experts suggest older Americans are struggling with debt taken on for their children's education or for their own later-in-life schooling.

The economist clarified that while exporters and businesses have absorbed initial costs, the burden is expected to shift to consumers by the fall, potentially pushing a key inflation metric higher.
