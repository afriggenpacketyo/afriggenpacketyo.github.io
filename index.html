          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 16:25:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently resurfaced recordings feature Jeffrey Epstein discussing his close friendship with Donald Trump, depicting them as partying together for over a decade. Epstein claims Trump told him about only liking to 'fuck the wives of my best friends' after a tryst. The Trump campaign has dismissed the tapes as lies and election interference. While the veracity of Epstein's claims cannot be verified, the recordings serve as a reminder of the well-documented connection between the two men and the accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump himself. The article highlights that Epstein and Trump eventually had a falling out in 2004 after they reportedly feuded over the since-destroyed Maison de lâ€™Amitie estate in Palm Beach.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are engaged in a public feud, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's budget bill. Trump threatened to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies, while Musk claimed he helped Trump win the election. Musk also posted that Trump's name appears in the Jeffrey Epstein files. The dispute originated from Musk's opposition to the Republican tax and budget bill, which he has criticized as "outrageous" and a "disgusting abomination." The CBO estimated the bill would increase deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years.</p>
