        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst claims of a "White genocide" in South Africa, some Afrikaners are pushing back against the narrative, asserting that it is untrue and not widely held within their community. The article cites Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, who states that Whites remain economically strong, holding a majority of boardroom positions and earning higher incomes. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein also disputes the genocide claim, emphasizing that while violent attacks on farmers occur, racial motives are not generally a factor. He highlights his project to train young Black farmers, expressing optimism about the future of shared land ownership. </p>

          <p>Craig Steinley, vice president of the Appraisal Institute, has been ousted from his position following a New York Times investigation exposing allegations of improper touching and sexual harassment from multiple women. The national board voted to remove Steinley after a three-hour debate, prompted by a $412,000 settlement paid by the Appraisal Institute to a former employee who claimed sexual harassment. Steinley denies the allegations, calling his removal a retaliatory act driven by internal politics. The Appraisal Institute faces multiple lawsuits related to Steinley's alleged conduct, including a wrongful termination suit from a former employee who claims she was fired after exposing errors in testing materials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated an order by deporting eight migrants to a third country, potentially South Sudan, with insufficient notice. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, criticized the administration's actions as "unquestionably violative" of the court's order and suggested possible criminal contempt penalties. The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, where U.S. military personnel were on standby. Documents revealed the men were citizens of various countries and had been convicted of crimes. The judge is considering ordering interviews to assess their fear of being sent to a dangerous country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration defended its tariffs in a New York trade court, arguing that removing them would weaken the president's position during trade negotiations with China. The lawsuit, brought by Oregon and 11 other states, challenges the legality of Trump's use of a "national emergency" under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the tariffs. The administration claims the president's emergency declarations are not subject to judicial review and that only Congress can intervene. The tariffs in question include those imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada over fentanyl production and trafficking.</p>

The company stated that orcas represent characteristics such as flexibility and intelligence, aligning with the group's pursuit of digital intelligence, symbiosis, and happiness.

The price of the cryptocurrency rose to $108,955.10, with a high of $109,857, according to Coin Metrics. Cumulative inflows into exchange-traded funds that track the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion last week, benefiting from liquidity in the stock market and recent risk-off scenarios.

          <p>The Army is preparing to ship Abrams tanks from Fort Cavazos, Texas, to Washington, D.C., for a military parade on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's birthday and the Army's 250th anniversary. The parade will feature 28 M1A1 Abrams tanks, along with other military vehicles and aircraft. The event has sparked speculation that Trump is using it to realize his desire for a grand military parade. The Army estimates spending between $25 million and $45 million on the event, with additional security costs expected.</p>

          <h2>Texas Lawmakers Advance Bill Clarifying Medical Exceptions to Abortion Law</h2>

          <p>Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, which only allows abortions to save the life of the mother. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition. While the changes do not expand abortion access, they represent a shift for Texas Republicans. The bill needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Governor Greg Abbott.</p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House with a video alleging persecution of white farmers in South Africa. The video, played during a news conference, showed thousands of crosses lining a road, which Trump claimed marked burial spots for murdered white farmers. Ramaphosa disputed Trump's allegation, stating that black people are far more likely to be victims of violence in South Africa. The meeting aimed to reset US-South African relations, but the mood shifted after Trump asked for the lighting to be lowered for the video.</p>
