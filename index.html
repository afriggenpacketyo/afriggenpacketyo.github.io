          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 14:23:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida's Department of Health is cautioning against drinking unpasteurized raw milk after an outbreak sickened 21 people with E. coli and campylobacter bacteria. The outbreak, linked to a single farm, has led to seven hospitalizations and severe complications in two individuals. While it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, a loophole that has gained popularity through online wellness trends. Health agencies like the FDA and CDC maintain that pasteurization is the only way to ensure milk is free from life-threatening bacteria, despite claims of health benefits from raw milk advocates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Coinbase experienced a significant slide after the cryptocurrency platform announced a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes. This decline contributes to a more than 30% drop from its record high in July, a peak reached amid legislative momentum for crypto regulation. Despite a disappointing second-quarter revenue report, some Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, citing potential gains from new legislation, stronger bitcoin prices, and the expanding Ethereum ecosystem. The stock has seen considerable volatility throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the catastrophic implosion of the Titan submersible, which killed five people, was 'preventable' and resulted from 'critically flawed' safety practices by its owner, OceanGate. The extensive report states the company used 'intimidation tactics' to evade regulatory scrutiny and operated outside established deep-sea protocols. Investigators determined the vessel's carbon-fiber hull failed under pressure, and they faulted founder Stockton Rush for negligence that contributed to the tragedy.</p>

This new subscription tier is designed to complement premium services rather than compete with them and will run alongside the existing free Roku Channel.

          <p>A Vox article analyzes the cultural discourse surrounding Sydney Sweeney, particularly in light of the controversy over her American Eagle 'great genes/jeans' ad campaign. It delves into the historical archetype of the 'blonde bombshell,' tracing its origins from Jean Harlow to Marilyn Monroe and its potent, often fraught, symbolism in American culture. The piece argues that this archetype is deeply tied to specific ideas about white femininity, sexuality, and power, which helps explain why Sweeney's image repeatedly becomes a focal point for political debate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from CBS News examines the case for investing in 1-ounce gold bars, positioning them as a potentially strategic asset in the current economic climate. Key arguments include a revised short-term price forecast from Citi analysts, gold's historical performance as a hedge against resurgent inflation, and the practical flexibility smaller bars offer for liquidation. The piece suggests that for investors looking to preserve purchasing power and diversify away from volatile markets, physical gold in this form could be a timely consideration.

          <p>President Donald Trump has sharpened his rhetoric against Russia and its trading partners, stating that Russia's economy 'stinks' and that lower oil prices will cripple its war machine. He specifically threatened to substantially increase tariffs on India within 24 hours if the country continues to purchase Russian oil, accusing it of fueling the conflict in Ukraine. These comments are part of an escalating pressure campaign by the Trump administration to force Russia into a ceasefire agreement, with a deadline for a deal rapidly approaching.</p>

          <p>A comparative article details the significant differences in financial and social support provided to Ukrainian refugees across various European countries. While nations like Belgium offer substantial monthly stipends, others such as Poland and Sweden provide more limited daily allotments or one-time payments. The analysis comes as Germany, one of the more generous host nations, engages in a political debate over potentially reducing its 'Bürgergeld' payments for refugees, highlighting the lack of a unified EU-wide standard for aid.</p>

          <p>Coterra Energy reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings, largely due to higher-than-expected production volumes. Despite the strong quarter, the company's stock performance remains sluggish, weighed down by a difficult market environment with low prices for both oil and natural gas. The company is also continuing to address operational challenges related to excessive water in some of its Permian Basin wells, leading to a cautious outlook from market observers.

          <p>Two 6-to-7-month-old black bear cubs are being rehabilitated at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center after being found wandering alone in Calaveras County. A third rescued cub had to be euthanized due to a malformed shoulder and other untreatable injuries. The two surviving male cubs are recuperating in a large outdoor enclosure designed to prepare them for an eventual return to the wild, with wildlife officials working to give them the best chance of survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis of the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) reported savings suggests that its claims are significantly overstated. The review of three large canceled contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services found that the actual savings amounted to only a small fraction of the $6.4 billion claimed by DOGE. The discrepancy arises from DOGE reporting the total potential value of the contracts as savings, rather than the much smaller amount of obligated funds that were actually left unspent on the nearly expired programs.
