          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO, effective January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain as chairman. This decision, announced at the annual shareholder meeting, aims to reassure shareholders that Abel, the current vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will have full authority over company operations and capital deployment. Buffett's continued presence as chairman is intended to provide support for Abel, particularly in navigating potential acquisition opportunities amid volatile markets, given Berkshire's substantial cash reserves. The company's shares experienced only a slight dip despite the CEO transition announcement and a somewhat disappointing earnings report, reflecting investor confidence in the succession plan.

          <p>President Trump's 16th week in office is expected to be busy, including a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to discuss trade tariffs and Canada becoming the "51st state". Trade negotiations with China are ongoing, with China "evaluating" an offer from the U.S. to discuss tariffs. Trump stated he will not drop tariffs to bring China to the negotiating table, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted China's previous non-compliance with trade deals. Talks between Russia and Ukraine continue, with Trump expressing optimism about reaching a peace deal. A shake-up in the National Security Council involves Mike Waltz being nominated as U.N. ambassador and Marco Rubio potentially serving as interim national security advisor.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war, intended to revitalize American manufacturing, is reportedly having the opposite effect, with companies like Mack Trucks announcing layoffs due to tariffs and economic uncertainty. While some workers believe in the long-term benefits of tariffs, others are skeptical, acknowledging that manufacturing's role in the American economy is unlikely to return to its mid-20th century prominence. Despite the administration's goals, the largest employers in the Lehigh Valley, a region once synonymous with American industrial might, are now hospitals and Amazon warehouses. Many workers, however, continue to hope that tariffs will reverse the decline of manufacturing jobs in their communities.</p>

          <p>Amidst concerns over eroding disability rights, Ari Ne'eman, a disability rights advocate and researcher, draws parallels to the Reagan era, highlighting the importance of mobilization and reframing disability rights as broadly appealing. Ne'eman emphasizes the vulnerability of disabled Americans in the healthcare system, while also noting their unique need for comprehensive support services. He warns of potential cuts to Medicaid and the dismantling of agencies supporting independent living, urging advocates to employ strategies that resonate across the political spectrum. Ne'eman plans to track the impact of policy changes by monitoring access to services, family burdens, and unmet healthcare needs, while also expressing concern over recent statements that call autism 'preventable' and focus disproportionately on biological causes rather than support services.</p>

          <p>Five individuals, including a pilot and a 6-year-old boy, survived a harrowing 36 hours in a Bolivian swamp inhabited by alligators and anacondas after their small plane crashed. The survivors, who sustained injuries from the crash and were plagued by mosquitoes, clung to the wreckage and subsisted on cassava flour.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for the second consecutive month. The decision to boost output by 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly triple the expected amount, has raised concerns about an oversupplied market. Oil prices have already fallen significantly this year, and the increase in tariffs has further fueled recession fears, potentially slowing demand.

Cyber security experts recommend implementing additional security layers, such as code words, to verify the identity of employees requesting credential changes.

          <p>President Trump's policies, particularly his trade agenda, are raising concerns about the long-term value of the U.S. dollar and its status as the world's reserve currency. The dollar's strength is vital for maintaining low borrowing costs and consumer prices in America, but Trump's erratic trade policies and tariffs are shaking global investors' confidence. This has led to a surprising decline in the dollar's value, as capital appears to be fleeing the United States, potentially leading to higher interest rates and reduced living standards for Americans. The article suggests that the end of dollar dominance would force the U.S. government to pay much higher interest rates, exacerbating the burden of America's debt.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs Reflect a Changing Capitalism Beyond Economics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 06:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's tariffs, while lacking a sound economic basis, reflect a deeper political vision of "protectionism" aimed at preserving a way of life. The article argues that Trump is tapping into a need for a new "spirit of capitalism" that addresses the economic pain of those left behind by globalization. However, the author contends that Trump's approach is flawed because it protects some while hurting others, masking deeper issues such as inequality and welfare cuts. The author calls for a "democratizing spirit" that ensures decent lives for all through policies like fair trade and worker representation.</p>

          <p>Autism researchers and advocates are opposing the creation of a national autism database, expressing concerns about potential misuse and ethical implications. While the HHS denies it's a registry, the agency confirmed a "real-world data platform" will power a $50 million study on autism, leading to fears of privacy breaches and discrimination. Critics highlight the importance of informed consent and the potential for the database to worsen stigma, with some raising concerns about a slippery slope to eugenics.

          <p>The article discusses the impact of Lewis W. Hine's photographs, which exposed the exploitation of child labor in the early 20th century and led to protective laws. It contrasts this with the current trend in some states to roll back child labor laws, arguing that the modern media landscape has diminished the disruptive power of photographs.
