          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 23:03:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes setting reciprocal tariffs at 15% and notably lowering duties on Japanese auto exports from 25%. This agreement is expected to boost Japan's economy, where auto exports to the U.S. are a critical sector. Following the announcement, Japanese automaker stocks, including Toyota and Honda, surged dramatically, with some climbing over 10%. The deal also involves a purported $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and aims to open Japanese markets to more American goods, including agricultural products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have taken the rare step of removing interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal lawyer to President Trump, from her position. The judges appointed her top assistant, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office. However, in a swift response, the Trump administration's Justice Department ousted Grace just hours later, accusing the judges of being politically motivated. The move has drawn sharp condemnation from Democratic senators, who decried the firing of a career public servant as an attempt to undermine judicial independence and the rule of law.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tom Homan, who served as President Trump's border czar, has sharply criticized Hunter Biden for his recent comments on U.S. immigration policy. During a podcast interview, Biden had compared the administration's deportation agenda to Nazi Germany, calling it a targeted action against a minority group. Homan dismissed the critique, using pejorative language to refer to Biden's past struggles with drug addiction. He contrasted the current situation with what he described as achieving the "most secure border" in the nation's history under Trump's leadership.</p>

          <p>According to the latest Henley Passport Index, Singapore possesses the world's most powerful passport for 2025, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 destinations. Japan and South Korea follow closely in second place, while several European nations dominate the remainder of the top rankings. The index highlights a continued decline for the passports of the United States and the United Kingdom, which have fallen to 10th and 6th place, respectively. This marks a significant shift from their previous top-tier status, with the U.S. now on the verge of dropping out of the top 10 for the first time.</p>

          <p>Chinese firms are being advised to deepen their integration within Southeast Asian economies to navigate escalating U.S. trade pressures. The counsel comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods transshipped through countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local ASEAN economies, Chinese businesses can better shield themselves from unpredictable tariff policies. This strategy is seen as a long-term solution as the U.S. imposes an average tariff rate of 42% on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged with 37 counts of attempted murder after allegedly driving his car into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub, injuring dozens. The suspect, Fernando Ramirez, was reportedly ejected from the Vermont Hollywood nightclub before returning and plowing his vehicle into patrons and vendors. At least 36 people were injured, with eight suffering serious fractures and lacerations, though miraculously no one was killed. After the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the car and assaulted him; police are still seeking a person who shot him during the altercation.</p>

          <p>The historic Ryde Hotel in Northern California has reported that dozens of its resident peacocks and peahens are missing and believed to have been stolen. Staff at the Art Deco hotel noticed the birds were gone after a customer reported seeing two men capturing one and placing it in a truck. The flock, which grew from five birds purchased 14 years ago, had become a signature feature of the hotel, beloved by staff and guests. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a property crime, with the birds valued at over $1,000 each.</p>

Recent attacks have resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths, drawing international condemnation and shifting focus to this new theater of the conflict.

One month after the attack, which Iran says killed 80 people, former Evin inmates describe overcrowded cells, poor sanitation, and lack of basic amenities in other facilities. Amnesty International has labeled the strike on the prison, a known site for holding political dissidents, a serious violation of international law that should be investigated as a war crime.

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will implement a low double-digit price increase across its candy portfolio to combat the soaring cost of cocoa. This move, which will affect popular brands like Hershey Kisses and Reese's, is a direct response to a global cocoa shortage driven by adverse weather and disease in key growing regions. Cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years, prompting Hershey to also focus on developing products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of a broader strategy to become a diversified "snacking powerhouse."</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is systematically removing women from the highest ranks of the U.S. military. The piece points to the recent reassignments of several high-profile female leaders, including the first female superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy and the first female Chief of Naval Operations. The author contends these moves send a chilling message that women are not welcome in top leadership roles, despite the military's reliance on female recruits to meet its numbers. The actions are framed as a form of social engineering to fit a regressive vision.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Findlay Curtis made a memorable first competitive start for Rangers, scoring a stunning goal in a Champions League qualifier against Panathinaikos. The young attacker's performance was a bright spot in what new manager Russell Martin described as an otherwise uncomfortable first half for the team. Curtis's goal helped shift the game's momentum, and his driving run later led to a red card for an opposing player. The victory gives Rangers a crucial two-goal advantage heading into the second leg of the qualifier, with the teenager's performance earning high praise.</p>

          <p>Residents of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile are raising concerns about "overtourism," citing the proliferation of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous thoroughfare. Locals claim that the dominance of these shops, which cater to the city's five million annual tourists, has displaced essential businesses like grocers and butchers, making the area less livable for permanent residents. The increase in holiday lets and a decline in the local primary school's enrollment are also seen as symptoms of the strain from mass tourism. The city council acknowledges the challenges and plans to use a new visitor levy to manage the impact.</p>
