          <p>Amid escalating sectarian clashes targeting the Druse minority in Syria, Israeli fighter jets struck near the presidential palace in Damascus, signaling a warning to President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated the strikes aimed to prevent harm to the Druse community, with this being the second military intervention by Israel in Syria this week. The Druse community in Israel has been pressing for intervention, prompting the strikes after Druse protesters blocked highways. The U.S. State Department has called on Syria's government to halt the violence and hold perpetrators accountable, emphasizing the dangers of sectarianism. (optimism score: 30)</p>

The large-scale Dream Concert is also scheduled to take place in Hainan province. Analysts suggest this policy shift is part of China's broader strategy to stimulate discretionary spending in tourism, hospitality, and local commerce, with K-pop seen as a tariff-proof sector immune to cross-border tariffs.

          <p>A federal judge barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans from the Southern District of Texas, deeming the White House's use of the statute illegal. Judge Rodriguez found that the law, intended for times of declared war or military invasion, was improperly applied to modern immigration policy. The ruling applies only to Venezuelan immigrants in the Southern District of Texas but could influence other cases involving the Alien Enemies Act. The judge rejected the president’s claims that the arrival of Tren de Aragua members could be construed as an invasion. (optimism score: 45)</p>
