          <p>President Trump has nominated Vice Adm. Brad Cooper to lead U.S. Central Command, replacing Gen. Michael Kurilla, and Lt. Gen. Dagvin Anderson to head U.S. Africa Command, succeeding Gen. Michael Langley. Cooper, who previously led naval forces for CENTCOM, oversaw strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen and helped build a humanitarian pier off Gaza. Trump aims to restore stability in the Middle East, but challenges persist with the ongoing Gaza conflict and stalled nuclear deal negotiations with Iran. Cooper led 100 strikes in Houthi-controlled portions of Yemen while he was 5th Fleet commander, destroying the group's drone and missile capabilities that the Houthis used to harass commercial ships in the Red Sea. Optimism is tempered by the complexities of the region.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has echoed Elon Musk's criticism of President Trump's domestic policy bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance programs. Jeffries argues the bill disproportionately benefits billionaire donors while increasing the national debt. Musk has attacked the bill's high cost, while Jeffries focuses on its detrimental impact on healthcare and food security for vulnerable populations. The bill is currently under consideration by the Senate, with some Republicans also expressing skepticism about its Medicaid changes. The discord highlights a "Republican civil war" over fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation to ban or restrict travel from multiple countries, citing national security risks, according to administration officials. The ban fully restricts entry from 12 countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Iran, while partially restricting entry from seven others such as Cuba and Venezuela. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson stated the restrictions target countries with inadequate vetting processes, high visa overstay rates, or failures to share necessary threat information.

          <p>Jared Isaacman, whose NASA nomination was withdrawn by President Trump, stated that his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience" and will resign as CEO of Shift4. Trump withdrew Isaacman's nomination after reviewing prior associations, possibly due to donations to Democrats. Isaacman, who has ties to Elon Musk, suggested the timing was linked to Musk's exit from government service and criticism of Trump's tax bill. Isaacman led two private spaceflights through SpaceX and Shift4 invested $27.5 million in SpaceX.</p>

He emphasized the heavy reliance of U.S. businesses on Chinese manufacturers, despite efforts to diversify supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

The earnings gap between college graduates and high-school graduates has remained consistent since 2010. While a college degree still offers a wage premium, its relative value for lower-income students has declined, partly due to unequal access to high-demand fields and investment disparities in public universities.</p>
