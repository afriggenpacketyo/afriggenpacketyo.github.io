          <p>Following the death of Representative Gerry Connolly, House Democrats are vying for the ranking member position on the House Oversight Committee, a role that carries significant investigative power and public visibility. Four candidates—Stephen Lynch, Jasmine Crockett, Robert Garcia, and Kweisi Mfume—are in the running, each bringing different strengths to the table. Democrats are considering factors such as communication skills, ability to support lawmakers in battleground districts, and strategies for challenging President Trump. The vote is scheduled for June 24, and the outcome remains uncertain as various caucuses weigh their options, balancing seniority with the need for fresh perspectives and effective leadership. Optimism around the Democratic Party's ability to challenge Trump will be influenced by their choice. The position offers the possibility of becoming chair if the party wins back the majority in next year's midterm elections.</p>

          <h2>Japan Aims for Tariff Deal Progress with U.S., Prioritizing National Interests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 01:37:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated Japan's intention to advance tariff negotiations with the United States, emphasizing that national interests would not be compromised for a quick agreement. This announcement precedes a potential meeting between Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump at the upcoming G7 leaders' summit in Canada. Japan's chief tariff negotiator is expected to hold further discussions with the U.S., pushing for a mutually beneficial deal that recognizes Japan's increased investment and job creation in the United States. Ishiba's remarks followed U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's indication that the U.S. might extend its pause on reciprocal tariffs if negotiations proceed in good faith, as the imposition of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars, auto parts, steel, and aluminum has already caused uncertainty about how Japan's export-driven economy will fare. Japan faces a reciprocal tariff rate of 24 percent, including the 10 percent baseline duty already in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that ticket touts, who made millions by reselling tickets at inflated prices, allegedly received assistance from staff at major ticketing firms. Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites claimed to have worked closely with touts, with court documents revealing that some staff even bought tickets for touts. Touts were also offered financial incentives by resale sites and were allegedly offered meetings with Ticketmaster lawyers to find ways the company could help them. Ticketmaster denies these allegations, stating they refer to defunct companies and events from over a decade ago, but the report raises concerns about the company's commitment to fair ticketing practices prior to closing its resale sites in 2018.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda broadcasts along the inter-Korean border, marking a step towards easing tensions with North Korea under the new liberal government. The broadcasts, which resumed last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons, were halted as part of President Lee Jae-myung's efforts to restore trust and promote peace. This decision follows Lee's campaign promise to end the broadcasts, which he argued created unnecessary tensions for residents in border towns. While North Korea has not yet commented, South Korea has also called for civilian activists to stop flying propaganda leaflets across the border, though prospects for early dialogue remain dim due to stalled nuclear talks and North Korea's focus on relations with Russia.</p>

Frankie O'Reilly, who lost his partner Georgie to an Aids-related illness, participated in the project to cope with his grief and remember the brave people he knew.

Lord Brittan was falsely accused of being part of a paedophile ring, and the investigation, Operation Midland, cost the police £2.5m.

          <p>Despite promising to end the cycle of political retaliation, South Korea's newly elected President Lee Jae-myung is facing criticism for launching investigations into his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, and his wife. Each of the previous six South Korean presidents has faced criminal investigations, and Lee's actions suggest a continuation of this pattern. Concerns are rising about the concentration of power in Lee's hands and the potential for him to use his position for personal gain. The article also highlights Lee's own legal challenges and the potential for political instability if he attempts to protect himself after his term ends.</p>

          <p>Japan has strongly urged China to prevent a recurrence after a Chinese military aircraft and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane were involved in a near miss over international waters in the Pacific. Japan conveyed its "serious concern" to China over the incident, which could have led to a collision, emphasizing the need for continued communication at various levels. The Chinese J-15 warplane flew as close as 45 meters to the MSDF P-3C patrol plane on Saturday, and a similar incident occurred on Sunday. Japan remains alert for increased Chinese military activity, including the simultaneous operation of China's aircraft carriers in the Pacific.</p>
