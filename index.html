        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Maine school districts are defying state Democratic leadership and aligning with Trump-era policies by banning transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports. Region School Unit No. 24 rescinded its policy allowing trans athletes to compete based on gender identity, while MSAD No. 70 is rewriting its policies to comply with Title IX's definition of sex as biological. These decisions follow protests and debates across the state, magnified after a trans athlete won multiple events at a girls' track meet. A survey indicated that a majority of Maine voters support restricting women's sports to biological females, reflecting a broader national debate on transgender rights and athletics.</p>

          <p>Traditional economic data is lagging in reflecting the impact of tariffs and trade uncertainty, leading economists to seek alternative indicators such as McDonald's sales, container ship traffic, and hotel bookings. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these unconventional measures to inform monetary policy decisions, facing challenges similar to those during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Conflicting signals from anecdotes and alternative data sources are complicating the Fed's decisions on interest rates, as officials weigh the risks of slowing growth against rising inflation. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's trade policies, which have led to increased consumer prices and shifts in business operations.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Butler Library at Columbia University, renaming it ‚Äúthe Basel Al-Araj Popular University‚Äù in an attempt to reignite campus protests. The university administration requested NYPD assistance to secure the building, citing safety concerns and injuries to public safety officers. This event complicates ongoing negotiations between Columbia and the Trump administration regarding federal funding, which was cut due to concerns about the university's handling of antisemitism. The protest, organized by Columbia University Apartheid Divest, seeks to pressure the university to divest from entities profiting from Israeli actions, highlighting the ongoing tensions and divisions within the pro-Palestinian movement on campus.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate its Energy Star offices, a program that has guided consumers toward energy-efficient appliances for decades, according to agency documents. Consumer and environmental groups are raising concerns about the impact of these cuts, which align with the Trump administration's shift away from climate change initiatives. Since its launch in 1992, Energy Star has reduced energy costs by over $500 billion and prevented significant greenhouse gas emissions, but faces proposed elimination under Trump's budget, which views the program as an overreach of government authority. Critics argue that losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to access trustworthy information about products' energy use.</p>

She co-founded Levels, a health app connected to glucose monitors, and gained prominence for decrying the influence of the food and drug industry.

          <p>Cargo volume at the Port of Los Angeles has decreased by 35% following the implementation of increased tariffs on Chinese goods, impacting businesses across Southern California. Longshore workers are experiencing reduced work opportunities, while independent salesmen selling to port workers report a significant drop in business. Port officials predict that consumers may soon face shortages and price hikes as stockpiled inventory runs out. Experts express concerns about the long-term effects, even if the tariffs are removed, due to the complexities of restoring shipping schedules and supply chains.</p>

          <p>Part of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after remaining in orbit for over half a century. NASA believes that one of the pieces, likely the lander probe, could survive re-entry due to its robust heat shield designed for Venus's atmosphere. Experts consider the risk to people on the ground to be low, as 70% of the planet is covered by sea, and the capsule's projected flight path covers most of the inhabited world, ranging from London to the southern tip of South America.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates, with further reductions predicted later in the year, potentially lowering borrowing costs for businesses and individuals. Analysts anticipate a cut to 4.25% from 4.5%, though possibilities for no change or a larger reduction remain. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is closely monitoring inflation and global economic uncertainty, including the impact of President Trump's tariff policy. The likelihood of rate cuts has already influenced mortgage pricing, with lenders reducing rates on new fixed deals, although further falls are not guaranteed.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing violations of due process rights. The order came after reports that the U.S. military could begin flying migrants to Libya as early as this week, a move likely to spark controversy due to the country's ongoing conflict and human rights concerns. Libya's prime minister has stated that his country refuses to be a destination for migrant deportations. The judge's ruling restricts the administration's ability to quickly deport migrants without providing them with proper notice and opportunity to appeal.</p>

The delays began after a communications and radar outage in the Philadelphia air traffic control facility, and the FAA is taking steps to improve speed, reliability, and redundancy.
