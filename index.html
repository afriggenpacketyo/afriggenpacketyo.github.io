        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a problematic February bar exam plagued by technical difficulties, the State Bar of California has approved scoring adjustments, leading to over 200 test-takers changing from "fail" to "pass." The adjustments, including giving applicants the higher of two scores for written questions, increased the overall pass rate from 56% to 63%. This decision comes after lawsuits were filed due to the exam's issues, with the state bar implementing remedies like a lower raw passing score and "imputed" scores for those unable to complete significant portions. While some trustees expressed concerns about the higher pass rate and the bar's duty to protect the public from unqualified lawyers, the Bar said it aimed to find fair solutions while maintaining the exam's integrity.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has revealed that it is underperforming and requires stronger regulation to better protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted that public trust has been undermined by issues such as pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. Set up by the government in October amid public concern about sewage spills and rising bills, the review aims to address these critical shortcomings. The government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, arguing it would be too expensive and not necessarily lead to improvements.</p>

The plans, responding to a strategic defense review, include increased weapons production, investment in cyber command, and a commitment to NATO. While aiming to increase defense spending to 3% of national income, the government faces questions about funding and the feasibility of achieving this goal.</p>

Scott, who signed a significant contract this offseason, has struggled with a high earned-run average.

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank will not aggressively raise its policy rate unless economic and price conditions show clear improvement, citing significant uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. Ueda reiterated the BOJ's policy to gradually increase rates if the economy and prices align with expectations. His comments follow the central bank's recent revision of economic growth and price projections for the current fiscal year, while maintaining its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent. Trade frictions stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could potentially slow the global economy and reduce domestic companies' profits.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Tokyo metropolitan assembly election is viewed as a critical gauge of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's long-term prospects, potentially influencing his future and even forcing his resignation. Ishiba's popularity has declined due to concerns about his economic policies, including attempts to curb rising rice prices. The assembly election has historically served as a bellwether for national politics, impacting leadership changes and economic direction. Analysts suggest that unless Ishiba achieves positive results in trade negotiations with the United States, his political standing will remain precarious. (not investment advice)</p>
