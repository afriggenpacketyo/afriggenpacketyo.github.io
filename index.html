          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, is back in the United States to face charges of illegally transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts related to a years-long conspiracy involving transporting migrants from Texas. Federal prosecutors sought to detain Abrego Garcia, citing community danger and flight risk, with a potential sentence of 10 years per transported migrant if convicted. His attorney claims the charges are an abuse of power to avoid admitting the initial deportation mistake, while Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador for returning Abrego Garcia, highlighting his role in a smuggling ring. Optimism is low given the serious nature of the charges and the political undertones of the case.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency, is facing criticism from Republicans after projecting that Republican legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Established in 1974, the CBO provides objective budgetary analysis to Congress, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. While its cost estimates are advisory, the CBO's work is often complex, involving economists and budget analysts to calculate the budgetary impacts of proposed bills. Critics point to past inaccuracies, but defenders emphasize the difficulty of predicting future economic conditions.</p>

          <p>California's Latino Legislative Caucus is opposing Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal to limit state-funded healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The proposal includes freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented individuals over 19 in 2026 and imposing monthly premiums. Lawmakers like Assemblymember Liz Ortega argue that the plan sets a dangerous precedent, while Senator Caroline Menjivar likened the proposal to a Republican agenda. The caucus is urging Newsom to maintain access to Medi-Cal for all residents, despite budget constraints.</p>
