          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the most detailed image yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet's icy core is estimated to be no more than 3.5 miles across. The new photographs provide astronomers with valuable data on its size and composition as it makes its closest approach to the sun. The object poses no threat to Earth and will remain observable with telescopes through September.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of Mark Zuckerberg's stated goal for artificial intelligence, which he describes as creating a "personal superintelligence" for everyone through devices like smart glasses. The author argues this vision is bleakly unambitious, focusing on increasing user engagement and ad revenue rather than leveraging AI for more profound societal advancements. This perspective is contrasted with Meta's aggressive, multi-billion dollar spending to acquire top AI talent, suggesting a disconnect between the company's rhetoric and its massive investment in the technology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new overhaul of the federal Standard Repayment Plan for student loans could result in higher long-term costs for some borrowers. The plan extends repayment periods for those with larger balances, which may lower monthly payments but significantly increases the total interest paid over the life of the loan. For example, a borrower with $100,000 in debt could pay nearly $50,000 more in total. Experts warn of a "cliff effect" where small differences in loan balances push borrowers into much longer and more expensive repayment tiers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis challenges Donald Trump's recent claims that he severed ties with Jeffrey Epstein in the early 2000s after Epstein allegedly poached employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. The author points to evidence, including a 2002 magazine interview where Trump praised Epstein and a 2004 real estate rivalry, to argue that their relationship continued well after the time Trump claims it ended. The article suggests Trump's story is a self-serving attempt to distance himself from the convicted sex offender amid renewed scrutiny.</p>

Friedman concludes with an optimistic view that the U.S. is experiencing a predictable, cyclical crisis and will emerge stronger.</p>

          <p>This article delves into a counterintuitive economic concept known as the "Grim Reaper effect," where policies that successfully extend human lifespans can have a negative impact on the federal budget. Because the U.S. government spends heavily on programs for seniors like Social Security and Medicare, longer lives mean more years of benefit payments. This creates a macabre fiscal reality where, from a purely budgetary standpoint, premature death can appear financially beneficial to the government, complicating the evaluation of public health initiatives.</p>

          <p>According to a new Federal Trade Commission report, adults aged 60 and older lost $700 million to imposter scams in 2024, a more than fivefold increase since 2020. In these scams, criminals pose as representatives from trusted companies or government agencies to create a fake crisis and persuade victims to transfer money. The FTC warns that the actual losses are likely much higher, as many instances of elder fraud go unreported due to embarrassment or a lack of awareness.</p>

          <p>The United States has increased its reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million, doubling the previous amount. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new reward, accusing Maduro of collaborating with drug cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister condemned the move as a "pathetic" and "crude political propaganda operation," dismissing it as a desperate distraction.</p>

          <p>England's Premier League has ended its formal partnership with the LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall and will no longer participate in the annual Rainbow Laces campaign, which it had supported since 2017. The league intends to launch its own inclusion campaign during LGBTQ+ History Month in February. The decision follows some players opting out of the campaign for religious reasons and a broader trend of organizations reassessing their ties with Stonewall over impartiality concerns.</p>

The National Crime Prevention Council, which runs the program, warned the loss of funding will have a "life-and-death impact."

          <p>For the sixth consecutive month, Las Vegas has experienced a year-over-year drop in visitor numbers, a trend that economists suggest could be an early indicator of broader economic problems in the U.S. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including reduced international travel and more cautious spending from domestic consumers facing inflation and economic uncertainty. Because Las Vegas tourism often reflects national consumer confidence, this slowdown is being watched closely as a potential economic bellwether.</p>

Since the 2015 Paris Agreement, major financial institutions have injected approximately $7 trillion into fossil fuels, driven by high short-term profits. While some funds are divesting, critics argue that voluntary pledges are ineffective and that only binding government regulation can force the large-scale shift of capital from fossil fuels to renewable energy needed to meet climate goals.

          <p>An analysis of the political dynamics surrounding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan for a full military takeover of Gaza reveals deep divisions. The move is reportedly opposed by Israel's own army leadership, which views it as a strategic trap that would endanger hostages. Many observers believe Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to appease his far-right coalition partners and ensure his political survival, a strategy that is further isolating Israel from its international allies and angering the families of hostages.</p>
