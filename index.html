        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has revised his recent rhetoric, stating he intends to "clean up" American cities rather than "go to war" with them. This clarification follows a controversial social media post that used war-film imagery in reference to Chicago, drawing sharp criticism from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. The administration has suggested it may deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led cities to address crime and assist with immigration enforcement, a move that has already faced legal challenges for potentially violating federal law.</p>

          <p>Florida's health department is moving to make several school-required vaccinations voluntary, a policy expected to take effect in approximately 90 days. The rule change, championed by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, would initially apply to vaccines for diseases like chickenpox and hepatitis B, while requirements for measles and polio would currently remain. This significant shift in public health policy has drawn strong criticism from medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warn of the potential for dangerous outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>

However, two second-half goals in quick succession from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz ultimately secured the victory for Germany, giving them their first crucial points in the qualifying Group A.</p>

          <p>California's Republican party has found a powerful unifying issue in its opposition to Proposition 50, a ballot measure proposed by Governor Gavin Newsom to redraw the state's congressional districts. At their fall convention, party members expressed energized resistance, framing the special election as a crucial battle for political survival. If passed, the measure could cost the GOP up to five seats in the U.S. House, potentially determining control of Congress during the final years of the Trump administration, making its defeat the party's top priority.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the federal government could be forced to issue massive refunds if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan. He stated that if the tariffs are struck down, the Treasury might have to refund hundreds of billions of dollars to businesses, creating a significant financial disruption. The administration has asked the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn a lower court's decision that found most of the tariffs were implemented illegally, highlighting the legal and economic uncertainty surrounding the trade policy.

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead becoming more regional and centered in Asia. In a recent interview, he explained that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are a testament to the ongoing success of global integration. Goldin also noted the challenges of this shift, including the United States seeking to distance itself from the process and the increasing global risks, like pandemics, that accompany deep interconnectedness.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the U.S. Open men's final, his first appearance at the event in a decade, prompting both cheers and boos from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium. His presence led to enhanced security measures, which caused long lines for spectators and delayed the start of the championship match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked its broadcast partners to refrain from showcasing any off-court disruptions or crowd reactions related to the president's visit.</p>

          <p>In his column, market analyst Jim Cramer examines the economic impact of President Trump's second term, arguing that focusing on the president's media presence is not a lucrative investment strategy. He points to the weak August jobs report as a sign of potential trouble, attributing some of the slowdown to federal job cuts and the cultural battles impacting green energy projects. Cramer concludes that while Trump dominates headlines, his direct effect on the economy and the stock market is less significant than many investors may believe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas Senator Roger Marshall, a physician, defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as a "disrupter" at the CDC, arguing in favor of greater parental and doctor discretion in vaccination schedules. In a television interview, Marshall stated that not every child needs every vaccine, specifically questioning the necessity of the hepatitis B shot for all newborns in stable, low-risk situations. His comments reflect a growing debate within the Republican party over established vaccine mandates and the authority of public health agencies.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions are publicly warning the government not to weaken its proposed Employment Rights Bill, a significant piece of legislation intended to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and strengthen protections against unfair dismissal. Union leaders have expressed concern that a recent cabinet reshuffle, which removed key supporters of the bill, may signal a reduced commitment to passing it in its original, robust form. Business groups, conversely, see the changes as an opportunity to amend parts of the legislation they find problematic, setting up a political battle.</p>

The raid, the largest single-site operation under the current administration's immigration campaign, has created significant diplomatic friction between the two close allies.

In an interview, Zelenskyy argued that Putin's main goal was to gain the legitimacy of a meeting with his U.S. counterpart, which he achieved. Zelenskyy's remarks came just before a record Russian aerial assault on Ukraine and underscore the complex diplomatic landscape surrounding the ongoing war, as he continues to call for more international pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>The UN's Universal Postal Union has reported that postal traffic to the United States has dropped by over 80% following the Trump administration's suspension of the "de minimis" trade exemption. This rule had previously allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country without facing tariffs. The administration defended the move as a way to combat illicit goods, but the sudden change has caused a near-halt in mail flow, with dozens of national postal operators suspending services to the U.S. pending a solution.
