          <p>Novak Djokovic secured a spot in the US Open semi-final against Carlos Alcaraz after a challenging match against Taylor Fritz, winning 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. Djokovic acknowledged that he felt fortunate at times during the close contest, particularly in the second and third sets when Fritz played exceptionally well. With Federer and Nadal retired, Djokovic is the only active member remaining from the iconic trio, and time is not on his side as he chases the 25th major that would take him clear of Australia's Margaret Court. The upcoming match against Alcaraz is highly anticipated as Djokovic aims for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title. The article reports on the details of the match, including key moments and Djokovic's comments, highlighting his resilience. The final score of the match was 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reacted to the appearance of Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Russian President Vladimir Putin at China's military parade. Trump accused Xi of "conspiring against" the United States while referencing America's support to China during World War II. He emphasized the sacrifices made by Americans in China's fight for freedom and hoped they would be honored. The gathering of Kim, Xi, and Putin occurred amid concerns over their collaboration in supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with accusations of North Korea supplying ammunition and troops and China providing material support to Moscow. The article underscores the geopolitical implications of the leaders' presence at the parade.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 23:57:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The court found that the situation did not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," rejecting the administration's argument that the Tren de Aragua gang's activities qualified as such. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, preventing the removal of migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas under this act, although the government can still pursue deportations through other legal avenues. The court also addressed the issue of due process, suggesting that seven days' notice of deportation is likely sufficient, but referred the matter back to the district court for further review. This decision marks another legal setback for the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Grand juries in Washington, D.C., have declined to indict two individuals accused of threatening President Donald Trump. One case involved Nathalie Rose Jones, who allegedly posted online threats and repeated them to Secret Service agents, while the other involved Edward Alexander Dana, who allegedly threatened Trump during an arrest for vandalism. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro criticized the grand juries' decisions, calling them politically motivated and a sign of a broken system. Dana's defense attorney, Elizabeth Mullin, stated that the cases were weak and should not have been brought to federal court. This article details the circumstances surrounding the threats and the reactions to the grand juries' decisions.</p>

          <p>Protests against tourists are increasing as residents feel the negative impacts of overtourism, including rising prices and displacement. In Mexico City, demonstrators shouted "Gringos leave," and damaged property, reflecting a growing trend seen in cities like Barcelona and Amsterdam. Residents often resort to protests due to fragmented tourism policymaking and a lack of faith in government action. While confrontations can temporarily deter tourists, arrivals often rebound, suggesting that protests alone are insufficient. Academics suggest solutions such as reducing short-term rentals, imposing higher taxes on tourists, and including local communities in tourism development. The article explores the causes and potential solutions to overtourism, highlighting the need for managed tourism.</p>

Trump had described LA as an "invaded" and "occupied city," but the judge's ruling accused the White House of turning the National Guard into a "national police force".

          <p>Protests over the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers have put police forces under "chronic pressure", according to a senior police chief. Chief Constable Gavin Stephens said people in leadership positions needed to think about how to "reduce and diffuse tension and not sow division". Police say there have been 3,081 protests between the start of June and 25 August, compared with 2,942 last summer and 928 in 2023.

          <p>The government is unable to calculate the total cost of a secret relocation plan it set up following the Afghan data leak, the public spending watchdog has said. The Ministry of Defence estimates the cost of the massive data breach - and setting up a new scheme to relocate those whose lives might be at risk over it - to be £850m. But the National Audit Office says the MoD has not provided enough evidence to give it confidence in that figure. Last month it was revealed the details of almost 19,000 people had applied to move to the UK in order to flee the Taliban were leaked. The MoD said it was committed to transparency and "committed to honouring the moral obligation we owe to those Afghans who stood with us and risked their lives".</p>
