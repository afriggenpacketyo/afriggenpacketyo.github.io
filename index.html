          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ordered Meta to revise its privacy policies, ruling the company violated an adult film star's freedom of expression by closing her Instagram account. Esperanza Gomez, who has over 5 million followers, had her account shut down for posting photos in her underwear, which Meta claimed violated its nudity rules. The court found Meta acted arbitrarily and applied its policies inconsistently, ordering a review of its terms to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge content moderation decisions.</p>

The meeting's agenda also includes Israel's military plans for Gaza City and the controversial expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank, which complicates prospects for a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The trial of a former British paratrooper, identified only as Soldier F, has commenced in Belfast for his alleged role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Londonderry. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder of two men and the attempted murder of five others during the civil rights demonstration where thirteen people were killed. The non-jury trial is a significant moment for the victims' families, who have campaigned for justice for decades, though the case highlights ongoing tensions surrounding legacy issues from The Troubles.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is launching a weeklong nationwide voter registration drive, focusing on battleground districts to combat a concerning trend of declining party registrations. Recent data shows Democrats have lost over two million registered voters since 2020, while Republicans have gained a similar number, creating urgency within the party. The initiative will target venues like college campuses and farmers' markets, representing a direct effort by the DNC to rebuild its voter base and infrastructure ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A deep dive into U.S. political strategy reveals how the Democratic party's failure to prioritize redistricting efforts over a decade ago has led to its current disadvantage against Republican gerrymandering. Despite warnings from some members, the party leadership did not counter the Republicans' successful "Redmap" project in 2010, which secured control over drawing legislative and congressional district lines. This strategic oversight allowed Republicans to create durable majorities, fundamentally shaping the political landscape and leaving Democrats in a prolonged struggle to regain ground.</p>

          <p>The rapid melting of glaciers in the Swiss Alps, driven by accelerating climate change, poses a significant threat to the stability of Europe's major rivers like the Rhine, Rhône, and Danube. Scientists have observed an alarming loss of ice volume, which will alter the seasonal flow of these vital waterways, potentially leading to severe water shortages during hot, dry summers. This environmental shift is already forcing industries, such as German shipping on the Rhine, to adapt to record-low water levels, highlighting the cascading consequences of glacial retreat.</p>
