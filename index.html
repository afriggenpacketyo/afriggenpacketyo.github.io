          <h2>Gen Z Adopts "Crashing Out" as a Term for Emotional Overwhelm and Catharsis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The slang term "crashing out" has gained popularity on platforms like TikTok to describe a state of intense emotional release, anger, or mental exhaustion. Originating in music, the phrase is now used by Gen Z to label behaviors ranging from emotional breakdowns to public altercations, often in response to personal or global stressors. While some view it as a necessary form of catharsis, mental health professionals express concern that normalizing such behavior discourages the development of healthy coping mechanisms and self-regulation. The trend highlights a generational shift in discussing mental health, blending authentic vulnerability with online performativity.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that 50.2% of Japanese voters hope the ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, will lose its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election. The poll, conducted nationwide, also shows that rising prices are the top concern for nearly a third of respondents, influencing their voting decisions. While the ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains the most popular, its support is closely followed by several opposition parties. The cabinet's approval rating has fallen to 32.4%, signaling significant public discontent ahead of the July 20 election.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Colorado funeral home, Jon Hallford, has been sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in prison for wire fraud after being found to have stashed nearly 190 decaying bodies.

During the sentencing, victims shared harrowing stories of their grief and the trauma caused by the deception. Hallford also faces sentencing on 191 state counts of corpse abuse, to which he has pleaded guilty.</p>

          <p>BÃ¤rbel Bas, a politician from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), serving alongside Lars Klingbeil. Her election is seen as a move to rejuvenate the party after it suffered a historic defeat, and her position on the party's left wing is intended to counterbalance Klingbeil's more conservative stance. In her new dual role as party co-chair and Germany's labor minister, Bas faces the significant challenges of reforming unemployment benefits and the pension system. She was elected with a strong 95% of the delegate vote.</p>

These statements come as an Israeli official indicated Netanyahu may travel to Washington, suggesting potential movement on a new deal.

Critics are alarmed by the lack of public process and worry about potential misuse of the data, especially given past issues with inaccurate data matching efforts.

          <p>Couples planning weddings in the U.S. are facing unexpected costs as new tariffs on Chinese-made goods impact the bridal industry. With approximately 90% of American wedding dresses manufactured in China, a temporary 30% tariff has led designers and boutiques to raise prices or add surcharges. This has created uncertainty for both store owners, who struggle to budget for future costs, and brides, who are hesitating on purchases and exploring alternatives. The industry argues that shifting production to the U.S. is not feasible due to a lack of skilled labor and significantly higher costs.</p>

          <p>Iran's judiciary has announced that an Israeli airstrike on Tehran's Evin prison on June 23 resulted in the deaths of 71 people. The victims reportedly included prisoners, administrative staff, guards, and visiting relatives. Evin prison is infamous for holding political detainees, including Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi and foreign nationals. The announcement comes amid escalating tensions and an ongoing Israeli military offensive in northern Gaza, where residents have been ordered to evacuate. The events follow a 12-day war between Israel and Iran that has heightened regional instability.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium to near-weapons grade within a matter of months. This assessment contradicts claims by former President Donald Trump that recent U.S. and Israeli strikes had completely obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities. Grossi acknowledged the damage was severe but not total, emphasizing that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program. The IAEA remains concerned about the location of approximately 400 kilograms of previously enriched uranium, further complicating diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former middleweight world champion Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. in a unanimous decision victory in Anaheim, California. Paul, 28, controlled the fight against a passive ChÃ¡vez Jr., who threw few punches for most of the contest, much to the visible frustration of his legendary father at ringside. Despite being jeered by the crowd, Paul claimed an easy victory and called out current champions, expressing his readiness for a title shot. The win continues to fuel debate about Paul's legitimacy in professional boxing and the caliber of his opponents.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israeli strikes across Gaza have killed at least 81 Palestinians and injured over 400 within a 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near a stadium in Gaza City that was being used as a shelter for displaced people, killing at least 11 individuals, including children. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a "suspicious individual" and took steps to mitigate civilian harm. The attacks continue as mediators intensify efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, following the collapse of a previous truce in March.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Samuel Woodward guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student. Prosecutors argued that Woodward, who was linked to a neo-Nazi group, was motivated by hate when he stabbed Bernstein 28 times. The defense conceded that Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an impulsive act of voluntary manslaughter provoked by an alleged sexual advance. After a six-year legal process, the verdict means Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>France is leading a â‚¬1.35 billion investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The move makes the French state the company's largest shareholder and signals a strategic push for technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, citing its much smaller satellite constellation and different technical architecture. While Eutelsat may struggle in the mass market, it is well-positioned to serve security-sensitive government and enterprise clients in Europe who prioritize jurisdictional control.</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a Taiwanese-administered island located just 10km off the coast of mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the complex relationship between Taipei and Beijing. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its proximity to the mainland city of Xiamen, interviews on the island reveal the distinct limits of influence from both sides. Taipei continues to see Quemoy as a symbolic deterrent, while the island's unique position highlights the practical and political challenges inherent in the cross-strait dynamic.</p>
