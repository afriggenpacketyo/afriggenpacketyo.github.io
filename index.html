          <p>Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned to air after a week-long suspension by Disney's ABC network, a decision prompted by controversial comments Kimmel made regarding President Trump's MAGA movement and the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Audience members at the taping described an "emotional" monologue and a warm reception, noting that Kimmel did not issue an apology. The suspension occurred amidst Federal Communications Commission scrutiny, with some local affiliates preempting the show, highlighting the intensifying tensions between the Trump administration and media companies. Trump also posted on Truth Social, threatening to "test ABC out on this," referencing a past $16 million settlement. This article details the show's return and the ongoing political and media reactions.</p>

          <p>Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, is reportedly evaluating a significant capital raise that could value the crypto company at approximately $500 billion, as confirmed by CEO Paolo Ardoino. The firm aims to secure between $15 billion and $20 billion for a roughly 3% stake via a private placement, intending to massively scale its strategy across existing and new ventures like artificial intelligence, commodity trading, and energy. This potential valuation would position Tether alongside major private entities such as SpaceX and OpenAI.

          <p>The USC Trojans football team faces significant uncertainty regarding the availability of star wide receiver Ja’Kobi Lane and starting left tackle Elijah Paige as they enter a crucial stretch of their conference schedule. Lane recently returned to practice following an upper body injury, but Paige's status remains unclear after he was not seen at practice, with coach Lincoln Riley referring reporters to the Big Ten’s availability report. Without Lane, the team relied on senior Jaden Richardson, who performed well. Paige's early exit in a previous game caused a chain reaction on the offensive line, though the offense still managed 517 yards. This article highlights the team's injury challenges and their potential impact on upcoming games.</p>

          <p>A new and highly controversial bronze statue has been erected on the east end of the National Mall, explicitly celebrating the "long-lasting bond" between President Donald J. Trump and convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The installation, permitted until Sunday, depicts the two men frolicking and holding hands, with plaques featuring lines from an alleged birthday letter from Trump to Epstein. This art piece, consistent with previous sculptures critical of the president, underscores a persistent issue that has caused divisions within Trump's base, despite his efforts to quash interest in their former friendship. The article notes the president's scathing response to the statue's appearance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made several inaccurate claims during a press conference, linking Tylenol use during pregnancy and in young children to an increased risk of autism, assertions that contradict medical evidence. He also claimed Amish children do not get vaccines or autism, a common anti-vaccine talking point refuted by studies identifying autism in Amish communities. Furthermore, Trump misrepresented the number of childhood vaccines and suggested changes to the hepatitis B vaccination schedule for newborns. This article fact-checks these statements, emphasizing that robust scientific evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, and highlights the safety and necessity of recommended vaccinations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump returned to the United Nations General Assembly, asserting a dramatic shift in his relationship with the world since his previous term, where he was once openly mocked. His speech, described as meandering and grievance-filled, belittled climate change, warned about excessive immigration, and mocked alliances and the UN itself, outlining a "Trump Doctrine" prioritizing national sovereignty and transactional relationships. Trump also unexpectedly shifted his stance on Ukraine, suggesting Kyiv could reclaim much of its territory while emphasizing European and NATO financial support, not increased U.S. aid. This article highlights how Trump's unapologetically "America First" approach has unsettled allies, prompting them to rethink their reliance on the United States and forge new partnerships.</p>

          <p>Greece's 'Watergate' phone spyware scandal deepens as four private individuals appear in court, allegedly involved with marketing Predator spy software. The software targeted government ministers, military officers, judges, and journalists, with some victims also under surveillance by Greece's National Intelligence Service (EYP), which was directly supervised by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Despite the government insisting no law enforcement agency used Predator, critics accuse them of a cover-up, especially after a Supreme Court report found no connection between Predator and officials. This article highlights the ongoing institutional scandal and the lack of accountability for those who ordered the surveillance.</p>

          <p>Iconic 76-year-old pop star Lulu has publicly revealed her long-hidden struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing the confession as liberating. She sought help in 2013 after admitting her problem to family at her 65th birthday party, subsequently checking into rehab in America and committing to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu, who was a "highly functioning alcoholic" even during her time on Strictly Come Dancing, kept her secret for decades, partly due to shame and a desire to maintain her "squeaky clean" image, which was cultivated from her childhood in Glasgow. This article details her journey to sobriety, influenced by her father's own alcoholism, and her hope to break the pattern for her grandchildren.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in the UK, exemplified by Leoni Clancey, are finding themselves unable to afford to move out of their parents' homes due to soaring living costs, even after years of saving. Research by the Skipton Group indicates that nine out of ten young adults living with parents would face housing, utility, insurance, and maintenance costs consuming nearly half their income if they moved out. This article highlights the significant financial barriers preventing independence for millions, noting that the number of adults living with parents rose to 4.9 million by 2021. Experts are calling for more social homes and diverse housing options in job-rich areas to address this generational challenge.</p>

This article highlights George's dedication and unique path through the Chelsea youth system, which included extensive personal training and playing against men, contrasting with the club's usual loan-and-sell strategy for academy players. His performance offers Maresca a valuable attacking option amidst other striker injuries and transfers, potentially disrupting the typical "Chelsea narrative."</p>

          <p>Spurious claims of election fraud, strikingly reminiscent of those following the 2020 election, are flourishing online, alleging that Kamala Harris, not Donald Trump, won the 2024 presidential election. One popular theory, from an anonymous Substack, claims an NSA audit found Harris won, citing a former CIA officer whose background and audit participation lack evidence. Another group, the Election Truth Alliance, points to statistical anomalies like Harris's underperformance in certain counties. This article explains that these theories rely on flawed statistical analyses and ignore real-world election safeguards, such as multi-party poll workers and public state audits, dismissing them as hollow and grifting attempts to undermine democratic processes.</p>

This article suggests that while China has long required individuals to pay tax on their foreign income, enforcement was previously lax and discretionary.
