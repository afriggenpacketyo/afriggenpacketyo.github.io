          <p>Amid escalating geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, wealthy mainland Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their real estate investments away from the United States. In 2024, Thailand, Australia, and Canada emerged as the preferred destinations for Chinese buyers seeking homes priced above US$5 million, according to Juwai IQI data. This shift marks a significant departure from 2023, when the U.S. was the top choice. Juwai IQI's CEO, Kashif Ansari, attributes this trend to geopolitical friction, protectionism, and heightened scrutiny of property deals.</p>

The party is now scrambling to find a new leader and analyze the reasons behind their electoral failure.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. This fulfills a campaign promise and marks a major victory for school choice advocates after years of effort. Starting next school year, families can receive $10,000 per year, with up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, though critics argue it will drain resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. The program will be capped at $1 billion initially, potentially costing up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

This choice highlighted the absence of dissenting voices and the prioritization of loyalty over moderation, indicating a more uninhibited and potentially reckless presidency.

The court deemed such schemes a "mere commercial transaction" that undermines the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister vowed to rework the system, concerns remain about "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for investments and pose similar risks of money laundering and corruption.

          <p>Kenyans are facing increased payroll taxes and new levies as President William Ruto attempts to address the country's staggering foreign debt and keep the government running.

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., is posing a significant challenge to both the governing Labour Party and the opposition Conservatives.

Experts suggest that the traditional two-party system in Britain is becoming increasingly unstable due to rising support for Reform and other smaller parties. This article analyzes the shift in the political landscape and the challenges faced by the main parties in a fragmented electorate.</p>

The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, an NGO advocating for separate surnames, indicates that the rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% expressing willingness to marry if separate surnames were permitted. Japan is the only country that requires couples to adopt the same surname upon marriage, a law that faces opposition from conservative members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
