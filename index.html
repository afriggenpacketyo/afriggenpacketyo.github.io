          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Alaska for over two and a half hours to discuss a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. While both leaders expressed optimism and alluded to significant progress on several points, they concluded the summit without announcing a specific agreement or a ceasefire. Trump stated he would follow up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO allies, emphasizing that "there's no deal until there's a deal" and that a subsequent meeting involving Zelenskyy would be crucial for finalizing any peace arrangement.</p>

Park staff confirmed the authenticity of the gem, which is the third-largest found at the public park this year, and she has named it the "Fox-Ballou Diamond" after herself and her partner.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," numerous major corporations have launched marketing campaigns centered on the color orange. The trend was sparked by Swift's frequent use of the color and her discussion of its personal significance on a popular podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Companies from United Airlines to Netflix quickly adopted orange-hued memes and posts, seeking to align their brands with the significant economic and cultural influence Swift commands, as demonstrated by the success of her Eras Tour.</p>

          <p>A Georgia court has ordered singer and actor Teyana Taylor to pay $70,000 in attorney fees to her ex-husband, former NBA player Iman Shumpert. The ruling came after Taylor was found in contempt of court for violating their 2024 divorce agreement by allegedly leaking settlement details to blogs, an accusation she also leveled against Shumpert. The judge sided with Shumpert after Taylor failed to prove he was the source of the leak and refused to provide her own financial information, which the court deemed relevant to the case.</p>

The article details his extraordinary life, from fighting against both British imperialism and fascism to filming key battles and witnessing the devastation in post-bombing Hiroshima, concluding with his somber view that humanity has learned little from war.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the return of standalone physical stores and its first catwalk show in seven years, years after its parent company collapsed. Once a dominant force in British fashion, the brand now faces the challenge of attracting a new generation of shoppers while appealing to the nostalgia of its original millennial and Gen-Z customer base. Industry experts note that while the brand's signature "London girl look" is back in style, its success will depend on navigating a competitive market with higher price points than fast-fashion rivals like Shein and recapturing the cultural "buzz" that once defined it.</p>

The proposal, which would need voter approval, seeks to override the state's independent redistricting commission and could create up to five more Democratic-leaning seats by concentrating Republican voters into fewer districts. This strategic maneuver is framed as a direct response to similar mid-decade redistricting efforts being pushed by former President Trump in Republican-controlled states like Texas, setting the stage for a high-stakes national political battle over congressional control.</p>

          <p>A new working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional milestones such as moving out of their parents' home, securing a job, getting married, and having children. Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had met all four markers, today less than a quarter have. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living, as well as changing societal attitudes toward family formation and a greater emphasis on higher education.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to ever captain England in international cricket, leading a T20 squad on a tour of Ireland in September. The decision comes as many of England's regular all-format players, including captain Harry Brook, are being rested. The appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has limited captaincy experience at the senior level but has impressed selectors with his leadership qualities in England's youth squads. The tour will also see a first call-up for Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it commissioned a "secret report" from known climate contrarians to justify rolling back key climate regulations. The lawsuit claims the Department of Energy assembled a panel of five climate-skeptic scientists to produce a report that downplays the negative impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. This report was then used by the EPA to support its move to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which allows for the regulation of carbon dioxide, prompting accusations that the administration is rewriting science for political purposes.</p>

          <p>This article provides context for the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, focused on ending the war in Ukraine. The summit was arranged after previous rounds of talks failed and Trump set a deadline for Putin to agree to a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not attending the talks but has welcomed them, while emphasizing that any deal made without Ukraine's input would be a "dead decision." The meeting's location in Alaska is historically significant, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of four Democratic officials. The attacks occurred in late 2022 and early 2023 after Peña lost his election by a large margin, which he baselessly claimed was "rigged." Prosecutors argued that Peña resorted to political violence and terrorism after his defeat, targeting officials who certified the election results. No one was injured in the shootings.</p>

          <p>A student loan forgiveness option known as PSLF Buyback is experiencing significant delays, with a backlog of 72,730 applications pending as of July 31, according to a recent court filing. The program allows public service workers who have reached 10 years of employment to retroactively make payments for past periods of forbearance or deferment to qualify for debt cancellation sooner. The backlog has grown under the Trump administration, leaving many borrowers waiting months for a response. The program became particularly popular after the Biden-era SAVE plan was blocked by courts, pushing many borrowers into a forbearance that paused their progress toward forgiveness.

The lawsuit cited a series of posts in which Stewartson accused Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court filings.

Luke Sung, formerly of Kis Cafe, recounted his encounter with influencer Karla Marcotte, stating he questioned her credentials after viewing her food content and told her he wasn't sure they had the same audience. Marcotte's video portrayed Sung as rude and critical of her follower count, leading to a social media backlash.

          <p>This article analyzes a recent social media trend where videos of sorority recruitment dances are framed by right-wing commentators as something that makes liberals "seethe." Accounts on X (formerly Twitter) have presented the videos of smiling, conventionally attractive young women as a display of patriotism and traditional values that supposedly enrages the left. However, the author finds no actual evidence of this liberal outrage, suggesting the controversy is entirely manufactured by engagement-farming accounts that profit from stoking political division. The phenomenon highlights how social media platforms can be used to create and amplify fake cultural dramas for financial and ideological purposes.</p>
