          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the relationship between China and Russia as more mature and stable than any other major global partnership. The statement came during a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, where preparations for Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit to Beijing were a top priority. Both ministers emphasized their commitment to implementing the consensus reached by their heads of state and collaboratively addressing global challenges through their comprehensive strategic coordination. This meeting precedes a broader Shanghai Cooperation Organisation gathering.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is in Washington for his first U.S. visit under the Trump administration to discuss critical security issues with his counterpart, Pete Hegseth. Key topics include finalizing the delivery of U.S. Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine, which Germany has offered to fund, and Germany's purchase of nuclear-capable F-35 fighter jets. The talks also address concerns over potential U.S. troop reductions in Europe. Separately, the article notes a grim trial beginning in Berlin where a palliative care doctor is accused of murdering at least 15 terminally ill patients.</p>

          <p>China's leadership is signaling a new policy priority to tackle 'neijuan,' or excessive domestic competition that yields diminishing returns, particularly targeting disorderly, low-price tactics. This initiative draws comparisons to the 2015 supply-side reforms but faces a different economic landscape characterized by weaker growth and a greater role for private firms. Analysts note that these factors will make it more difficult for Beijing to rein in overcapacity and guide enterprises toward higher quality production. The goal is to address key issues and promote the orderly exit of outdated industrial capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged past the $120,000 mark to set a new record, a rally largely attributed to significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Institutional buyers are seen as the primary drivers of this momentum, with bitcoin ETFs logging over $1.18 billion in a single day. The rally is also fueled by growing investor confidence as the U.S. Congress moves closer to passing clearer regulatory legislation for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest the cryptocurrency could reach $125,000 in the coming months, though potential U.S. Federal Reserve policies remain a risk. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts, as shipments to non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union remained robust. A temporary tariff truce with the U.S. also helped slow the decline in exports to America, while imports saw their first year-over-year growth in 2025. This trade performance has helped offset weak domestic demand, though economists caution that momentum could falter due to continued uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies. The trade surplus for the first half of the year stands nearly 35% higher than the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic floods in central Texas, which have claimed at least 129 lives, are being analyzed as the result of a 'toxic cocktail' of factors. This article from The Guardian connects the disaster's severity to the climate crisis, which leads to more extreme precipitation events, and the significant hollowing out of federal agencies under the Trump administration. Critics argue that understaffing at the National Weather Service and cuts to forecasting funds, championed by figures like Senator Ted Cruz, may have hampered the emergency response and warning systems, contributing to the scale of the tragedy.</p>

However, other economists counter that London's fundamental strengths, including the rule of law, cultural diversity, and a strong services sector, remain intact.

The review found delays in intervention, a lack of training for agencies in recognizing self-neglect, and long waits for assessments.

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, a significant turnaround from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, thus avoiding a technical recession. The growth, which beat economists' forecasts, was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Despite the positive data, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry maintained a cautious outlook, warning of 'significant uncertainty and downside risks' in the global economy for the second half of the year, largely due to unclear U.S. tariff policies.

Her insistence on a public trial and her powerful testimony led to the conviction of all 51 men and helped ignite a national debate that resulted in legal reforms strengthening the definition of sexual assault in French law.</p>

His comments reflect signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases, which could help bring down inflation and create room for easing monetary policy amid a contracting UK economy.
