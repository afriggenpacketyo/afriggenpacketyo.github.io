          <p>China has launched the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, positioning itself as a key architect of new global governance models. Beijing aims to enhance the representation of developing nations, filling gaps in existing international mediation mechanisms. Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized IOMed's role in improving global governance and expanding multilateral mechanisms. The organization's location in Hong Kong signals the city's evolving role beyond economics to include political influence, serving as China's bridge to the Global South. This initiative is viewed as an effort to strengthen China's global prominence and provide rule-of-law public goods. The institution aims to improve the participation of developing countries in global governance.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, offering select individuals rides in Model Y vehicles. The pilot program, starting June 22, will operate within a geofenced area, with a Tesla Safety Monitor in each car and remote monitoring for backup. Invited participants, primarily Tesla investors and enthusiasts, can use the Robotaxi App to hail the self-driving cars. Elon Musk anticipates scaling the service to 25 U.S. cities within the next year, but safety concerns and regulatory scrutiny remain. This rollout is crucial for Tesla, potentially boosting its market capitalization and solidifying its position in the autonomous vehicle market. The company hopes to surpass competitors like Waymo, despite Waymo already providing 250,000 paid trips weekly.</p>

          <p>During a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was denied an immaculate inning due to a controversial call by the home plate umpire. Yamamoto struck out the first two batters in the third inning and threw two strikes to Fernando Tatis Jr., but the umpire called the third pitch a ball, despite arguments it was within the strike zone. Although Yamamoto completed the inning with a strikeout, he missed the opportunity to record an immaculate inning, a rare feat in baseball. The game also saw tensions rise when Tatis Jr. was hit by a pitch, leading to benches clearing and ejections.</p>

          <p>Brendan Paul, a former college basketball player and personal assistant to Sean 'Diddy' Combs, testified at Combs' sex trafficking trial about the music mogul's drug use. Paul, who was arrested with cocaine he claims belonged to Combs, said Combs became 'extremely creative' when on drugs. He admitted to purchasing drugs for Combs on multiple occasions, including cocaine, ketamine, ecstasy, and marijuana. Paul's testimony is part of the prosecution's effort to portray Combs as overseeing a racketeering enterprise, while the defense acknowledges domestic violence but denies federal crimes. Paul said that he tried “tusi”, also known as pink cocaine, with Combs to prove his loyalty and that he thought it was good.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court panel has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The ruling supports civil liberties groups' argument that the mandate violates the separation of church and state.

Louisiana's Attorney General disagrees with the ruling's scope and plans to appeal. The court's decision upholds a previous order deeming the mandate unconstitutional, citing the First Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty.</p>

The grocery retailer has not specified which locations will be affected but has assured that all employees at the closing stores will be offered roles at other Kroger locations. This decision was announced alongside the company's first-quarter earnings, which showed a slight decrease in sales. Kroger expects the closures to provide a modest financial benefit, with resulting savings invested in customer experience initiatives.

          <p>Iran has declared it will not resume nuclear program talks while under attack by Israel, following warnings from Israel's defense minister about a 'prolonged' conflict. This statement came as exchanges of fire continued, with Iran launching missiles at northern Israel and Israel targeting sites in Iran. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met with European diplomats in Geneva, who urged a revival of diplomatic efforts with the U.S.. Araghchi stated Iran would consider diplomacy only after Israel's 'aggression is stopped,' asserting Iran's right to self-defense and the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. Meanwhile, President Trump suggested Iran had a maximum of two weeks to avoid possible U.S. air strikes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from U.S. immigration detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel's war in Gaza. Judge Michael Farbiarz stated Khalil is not a flight risk or a danger to the community. Khalil's arrest was widely criticized as an escalation in the Trump administration's campaign against protected speech. Three other students detained on similar grounds were previously released. Khalil is married to a U.S. citizen and has a newborn son, and his lawyers say that the judge's order does not address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon the family.</p>
