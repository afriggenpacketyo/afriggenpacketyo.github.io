          <p>President Trump dismissed the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, following the release of jobs data that was weaker than expected. The president baselessly claimed the figures were "rigged," a move that drew sharp criticism for politicizing a trusted government agency and was compared to actions in authoritarian countries. The dismissal, combined with new tariffs, led to a significant drop in US stock markets as fears of economic instability and a loss of trust in official data grew. (not investment advice)</p>

A significant portion of the output, around 60 percent from one project, is slated for direct shipment to China, reflecting Beijing's strategic drive to enhance its food security by securing overseas agricultural resources and production bases.</p>

          <p>A massive rescue operation is in progress in central Chile to reach five miners trapped after a partial collapse at the El Teniente copper mine, the world's largest underground copper mine. The collapse was triggered by a magnitude 4.2 earth tremor, which killed one worker and trapped the others over 900 meters deep. State-run operator Codelco has halted all operations at the mine, dedicating all resources to the rescue, though contact has not yet been established with the missing workers.</p>

She mentioned she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and said her return to the UK at age 16 was because her parents saw no future for her in Nigeria at the time.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists has revealed an ancient evolutionary link between the tomato and the potato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers traced the potato's origins back approximately nine million years to a hybridization event. This event involved an ancestor of the modern tomato and a tuberless, potato-like plant. The findings, published in the journal Cell, suggest that this ancient cross-breeding was the key evolutionary step that led to the development of tubers, the edible part of the potato.</p>

Airlines are legally required to provide care and assistance for significant delays or cancellations, but compensation is unlikely as wildfires are considered an "extraordinary circumstance."</p>

          <h2>Truck Spills Thousands of Hot Dogs Across Pennsylvania Highway</h2>

          <p>A truck carrying a large quantity of hot dogs spilled its contents across a major highway in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, causing significant traffic delays during the Friday morning commute. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to be ripped open after scraping against a concrete divider, scattering sausages across the road. Fire officials noted the unexpected slipperiness of the hot dogs, which complicated the cleanup effort. A front-end loader was ultimately used to scoop the discarded wieners into a dump truck for disposal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled a major case for its next term to determine if Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The case centers on the balance between complying with the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, which limits the use of race in drawing political maps. The court's decision could have significant implications for future redistricting efforts nationwide and the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives for the 2026 elections.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Link Increased Flooding in Northern China to Solar Cycle Activity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in the Journal of Climate suggests a link between decadal solar magnetic cycles and a pattern of increased summer flooding in northern China. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that solar activity influences the positioning of the monsoon rain belt, a key factor in regional drought and flood patterns. This finding could improve long-term climate predictions for flood seasons in China, attributing the observed "south drought and north flooding" phenomenon to the influence of the solar precipitation regime over extended timescales.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump just one day after the president publicly demanded that Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies drastically lower their drug prices. The White House sent letters to 17 drug companies, asking them to commit to selling drugs at much lower "most favored nation" rates. The timing highlights a complex relationship, as the president simultaneously pressures the industry for price cuts while benefiting from its financial support at a high-dollar fundraising event.

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board hearing has shed light on the fatal midair collision between a regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people. Key revelations include that the helicopter's altimeter may have been inaccurate, a known issue that was not considered alarming. Investigators also found that air traffic controllers faced pressure to "make it work" in a complex airspace, and that the FAA had failed to act on prior internal warnings about the safety of the helicopter's flight path.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning visitors about a significant seasonal increase in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from one to as many as fifteen. The rise is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing the rays closer to shore, coinciding with hot weather that brings more people to the beach. The area known as "ray bay" is a particular hotspot due to warm water outflow from a nearby power plant. Officials advise beachgoers to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish and avoid being stung.</p>
