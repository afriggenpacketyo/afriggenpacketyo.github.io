          <h2>Chinese Military Experts Propose Structural Reforms to Counter Drone Threats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 11:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts writing in the PLA Daily suggest China's military will likely establish specialized units to counter drone threats, a lesson learned from recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine. This long-term goal involves creating rapid-response drone combat units to address the inefficiencies of traditional forces. In the short term, existing units, such as electronic warfare teams, could be upgraded with AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming capabilities to better handle unmanned aerial threats. This reflects an ongoing structural shift that began as early as 2016.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow discusses his latest book on Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the author's complex personality and lasting impact on American culture. The article highlights Twain's journey from a modest upbringing in Missouri to becoming a literary giant, whose sardonic humor was often rooted in personal pain and a fear of poverty. Chernow notes that Twain's themes of politics, race, and money remain highly relevant today, solidifying his status as a vital voice in American life.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Ken Burns has described the potential elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided," following a White House push to defund PBS and NPR. Burns argues that public broadcasting is not a partisan entity but a crucial service, especially for rural areas where it may be the only available signal for news, education, and emergency information. He emphasized that his acclaimed documentaries would not have been possible without the support and unique production model of PBS.</p>

          <h2>Russia Formally Recognizes the Taliban as Afghanistan's Legitimate Government</h2>

          <p>Russia has become the first country to officially recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move the Taliban's foreign minister hailed as the start of a "new phase of positive relations." Experts suggest Russia's decision is driven by economic interests, including using Afghanistan as a trade hub to Asia, and a desire to set a trend among other authoritarian states. The recognition has alarmed human rights activists, who fear it normalizes the Taliban's severe oppression of their own people, particularly women and girls.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace's participation in the Europa League is uncertain, pending the outcome of an appeal by French club Lyon, which is also owned by John Textor's Eagle Football Holdings. Due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, if Lyon's relegation from Ligue 1 is upheld, they would relinquish their European spot, potentially clearing the way for Palace. The situation is complicated by Textor's impending sale of his 43% stake in Palace to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, creating a tangled web of financial and regulatory challenges for the club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are warning that President Trump is expanding executive power in ways that undermine democratic norms and could set lasting precedents for future presidents. The article cites actions like ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, using national emergency declarations to impose tariffs, and pressuring the Justice Department as examples of eroding the checks and balances system. While supporters see a decisive leader getting things done, critics argue these moves weaken Congress and the judiciary, representing a deliberate project to remove established limits on presidential power.</p>

          <p>A new book chronicles the moment Hulk Hogan, the all-American wrestling hero, turned into a "heel" (a villain) in 1996, a pivotal event in professional wrestling history. The article explores how this narrative shift, creating the New World Order faction, was a massive storytelling success that blurred the lines between fiction and reality for audiences. It also reflects on the potential cultural legacy of this moment, questioning if the embrace of a stylish, malevolent anti-hero in wrestling foreshadowed the rise of similar dynamics in American politics.</p>

          <p>Five months into the Trump presidency, the U.S. economy has neither entered a "golden age" as promised nor collapsed into "catastrophe" as critics feared, instead remaining remarkably stable. Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have not shifted dramatically, and GDP growth continues at an adequate, albeit slower, pace. The article argues that Trump's policies, including moderated tariffs, have not been significant enough to cause a major shock, resulting in an economy that is simply "okay" but may not be strong enough to satisfy voters.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"The King of Kings," a new animated film about the life of Jesus, aims to be accessible to both religious and secular audiences but largely falls short of that goal. Based on a Charles Dickens book and featuring a star-studded voice cast, the film's on-the-nose evangelism and awkward humor may not win over nonbelievers. The article contrasts it with more successful biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Chosen," which use character-driven drama to create a more universally resonant story, suggesting this film is a missed opportunity for the genre.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a key primary victory by a progressive candidate in New York, some analysts suggest the Democratic Party could be facing a grassroots populist takeover similar to the GOP's Tea Party movement. This potential shift is fueled by a divide between the party's establishment leadership and a progressive base that is increasingly angry and mobilized. While the original Tea Party had clear policy goals like repealing Obamacare, this new energy is more disparate, largely focused on a desire for new leadership and a stronger focus on working-class economic issues.</p>

          <p>A report from the research services of the German parliament, the Bundestag, has cast "substantial doubt" on the legal justification for recent Israeli and U.S. military strikes on Iran. The analysis, requested by a Left Party lawmaker, states that most international law experts believe the criteria for self-defense under the UN Charter were not met. According to the report, Israel would need to prove not only that Iran was about to build a nuclear weapon but also that it planned to use it, an obligation it must now legally justify.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Republicans in several states are actively working to disqualify mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day, a move that feeds into unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. A presidential executive order aims to enforce an Election Day receipt deadline for federal elections, while states like Kansas have already passed legislation to eliminate grace periods for ballot arrival. Critics argue there is no evidence these ballots are insecure, as they must be postmarked by Election Day, and that these efforts could disenfranchise voters.</p>

          <p>Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, 80, has been endorsed by the governing National Resistance Movement as its candidate for the 2026 presidential election, setting him up to extend his rule beyond 40 years. Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, has overseen two constitutional amendments to remove term and age limits. His main challenger is expected to be pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine, who has described facing growing state repression in a country where critics say Museveni has ruled with an iron hand.</p>
