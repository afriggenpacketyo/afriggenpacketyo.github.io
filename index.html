        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The absence of China's top general, He Weidong, from a recent Politburo study session has sparked speculation about his whereabouts. He Weidong, a high-ranking member of the Central Military Commission, was last seen publicly on March 11 and has missed several key events. While Beijing has not provided an official explanation for his absence, analysts suggest that it is unlikely to affect China's overall political stability, as Zhang Youxia attended the meeting.</p>

          <p>Major companies, including mining and energy giants, are increasingly interested in natural hydrogen, also known as white, gold, or geologic hydrogen, as a potential clean energy source. This hydrogen, found naturally beneath the Earth's surface, contains no carbon and produces only water when burned. Companies like Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Gazprom, BP Ventures, and Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures are investing in exploratory efforts across the globe, especially in Canada and the U.S. However, critics raise environmental concerns and distribution challenges, and the IEA warns that the resource may be too scattered to be economically viable.</p>

          <p>Laboratory testing of baby food pouches from leading UK brands reveals that many fail to meet key nutritional needs for babies and toddlers, potentially misleading parents. The pouches were found to be low in essential nutrients like vitamin C and iron, with some containing excessive amounts of sugar. Experts advise that these pouches should be used sparingly as a complement to homemade meals, not as a primary source of nutrition, to avoid potential health problems. Brands maintain their products are intended as part of a varied weaning diet and comply with UK regulations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's protectionist tariffs, while intended to safeguard the U.S. auto industry, may inadvertently isolate it from crucial global innovation. His policies risk cutting off American automakers from advancements in electrification, digitization, and automation, where China is rapidly gaining ground with significant state subsidies. The auto industry has historically been a cornerstone of American industrial power, but the U.S. is falling behind in the global race for next-generation vehicles, potentially impacting the economy and national security.</p>

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policy in England will impact over four million students, requiring most schools to limit compulsory branded items to three, plus a tie for secondary students. The government aims to reduce costs for families, estimating savings of around £50 per child by September 2026. However, uniform retailers warn that these changes could lead to higher costs due to the need to replace lower-quality generic items more frequently. Some parents are concerned that strict uniform policies will persist despite the changes.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines is forcing carriers to reroute flights, particularly those linking India to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East. This closure results in longer, more costly flights, potentially requiring refueling stops or route cancellations. While some airlines have temporarily suspended certain routes, analysts suggest that the airspace closure may not significantly increase airfares. The closure follows heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after a recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

          <p>The US military reports striking over 800 Houthi targets in Yemen since launching sustained air and naval strikes on March 15, aiming to diminish the threat the group poses to Red Sea shipping. US Central Command states that hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders have been killed in the operations, which have targeted weapons storage and manufacturing facilities. However, the Houthis claim that recent US attacks have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children. The US asserts it will continue to increase pressure until Houthi attacks on vessels cease.</p>

          <p>The US dollar's recent weakness, triggered by President Trump's trade policies, is creating an opportunity for the euro to emerge as a more attractive investment. Market volatility, including sell-offs of the dollar and US stocks, has prompted investors to seek stability elsewhere. European officials believe their adherence to the rule of law and predictability could draw investors to euro-denominated assets, despite ongoing global economic uncertainty.</p>
