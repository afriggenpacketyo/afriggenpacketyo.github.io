            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4.5% after a steep rise this week, fueled by President Trump's trade policies, causing investors to shift away from U.S. assets. The 10-year yield rose more than 50 basis points this week, marking one of the biggest spikes on record, after ending last week around 4%. This reversal suggests investors are losing confidence in U.S. debt as a safe haven, with China and Japan reportedly selling Treasurys amid trade tensions. The surge in yields is worrying both Wall Street and the White House, potentially signaling economic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system is delaying the collection of tariffs on freight shipments, including those from China affected by recent tariff policy changes. The glitch impacts the entry code used by shippers to exempt freight from tariffs, causing confusion and uncertainty for U.S. companies. Customs is advising importers to file cargo release forms separately from financial papers until the issue is resolved, raising questions about Customs' ability to manage the new tariff policies. This is causing additional complexity and paperwork for companies already struggling with tariff-related disruptions, raising concerns about the impact on the supply chain.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>This article discusses a subgenre of literature exploring the question of self when relationships and societal roles are removed. Katie Kitamura's novel, Audition, is examined as part of this trend, focusing on a character who reveals little of herself, instead conveying the identities of others. The article contrasts this with other works, such as Rosalind Brown’s novel, Practice, where a character is defined not by relationships but by her work and inner reflection. The piece ultimately argues for the existence of a unique, singular core within each individual, accessible through personal pursuits and introspection.</p>

            <p>President Trump's long-held belief in unpredictability as a negotiating tactic is now causing significant economic disruption as he implements chaotic and impulsive tariffs. Investors are losing confidence in the U.S. economy, leading to a flight from U.S. bonds and a spike in Treasury yields, contrary to the administration's goals. While Trump may still be aiming for trade deals, his actions are damaging the U.S.'s reputation and position in the global economy. The article questions how much economic pain the country will endure before Trump reconsiders his tariff policies.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department informed a federal judge that it cannot provide requested information about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, citing the need to review the Supreme Court's order. Judge Xinis expressed frustration at the lack of information regarding Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and the steps taken to facilitate his return. Abrego Garcia, who has no ties to MS-13, was deported due to an administrative error, and his lawyers accuse the Trump administration of delaying his return.

The student, who is not Jewish, alleges he was subjected to taunts, threats, and physical assault by activists who mistakenly believed he was Jewish.

            <p>Mortgage rates have spiked above 7% as a result of the bond market's reaction to President Trump's new tariffs.

Consumer sentiment has also declined, with expectations for inflation reaching levels not seen since 1981, further dampening the outlook for the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli was found guilty of orchestrating the murder of her husband, celebrity hairstylist Fabio Sementilli, by sending her lover to commit the crime. The verdict was reached after a 2 1/2-month trial where prosecutors presented evidence of Sementilli's involvement, including video footage and encrypted messages. While her lover claimed he acted alone out of love, the prosecution successfully argued that Sementilli was the mastermind, motivated by financial gain. Sementilli faces a life sentence without the possibility of parole.</p>

The judge had requested details on Abrego Garcia's location, status, and the steps being taken to facilitate his return. The Supreme Court had previously upheld the judge's order for the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, but also instructed her to clarify her directive.</p>

Alaska is experiencing a convergence of these issues, with increased pollen, mold, and wildfires, highlighting the interconnectedness of climate change and health.</p>
