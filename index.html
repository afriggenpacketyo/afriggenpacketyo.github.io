            <p>A 38-year-old man was arrested for allegedly setting fire to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence in Harrisburg. The suspect, Cody Balmer, reportedly hopped a fence and used a Molotov cocktail to start the fire while Shapiro and his family were inside. Charges against Balmer include attempted murder, terrorism, and aggravated arson. Shapiro stated that the attack was targeted, but officials are still investigating the motive, including the possibility of a hate crime. The fire caused significant damage, but no one was injured, and an investigation is underway to review security protocols. Optimism score: 70</p>

The tariffs, which include a 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles, are causing anxiety and fear among workers in Canada's car capital. The situation is seen as a "stab in the back" by Canada, a close economic and security ally of the US. Canada's political parties are rolling out plans to help the auto sector in response to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Greenlandic geologist warns that the prospect of a mineral bonanza in Greenland is a mirage, disputing claims of easy access to wealth from untapped resources. He argues that rare earth elements are commonly occurring and that Greenland does not have a special concentration of minerals. The geologist suggests that the focus should be on the quality of minerals and developing facilities for processing raw materials, rather than acquiring more territory. The US already has untapped rare earths and minerals, but lacks the technologies to refine them.</p>
