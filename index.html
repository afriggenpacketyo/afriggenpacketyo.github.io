          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the Constitution grants Congress and the states, not the President, the authority to regulate federal elections. The judge stated that Trump's unilateral effort to reshape elections exceeded his authority, especially given the Department of Justice's weak defense of the order. The ruling allows the administration to enforce sections related to database access for identifying non-citizens and actions against states not adopting Trump's mail-in ballot requirements.</p>

          <p>Consumer companies, including Chipotle and Delta, are lowering their financial forecasts due to concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. These tariffs are expected to increase the cost of key commodities and potentially lead to higher prices for consumers. While a 90-day pause on higher rates is in effect, uncertainty surrounding the trade war is causing consumers to reduce spending. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates a de-escalation in the trade war with China, and the White House has suggested potential tariff exemptions for automakers.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed his disapproval of Russian strikes on Kyiv, calling them unnecessary and poorly timed amid ongoing peace negotiations. He urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the conflict, citing the high number of casualties. Trump has previously insisted that Russia desires peace and criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for prolonging the conflict by refusing to cede Russian-occupied Crimea. Despite stalled peace talks, Trump maintains his belief that both Russia and Ukraine want peace, but need to come to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's efforts to withhold funds from "sanctuary cities." The ruling, in response to a lawsuit brought by San Francisco and other local governments, argues that withholding funding would cause irreparable harm and undermine trust between cities and their communities. San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu accused the administration of attempting to commandeer local police as federal immigration agents. The city previously won a similar lawsuit in 2018 after an appeals court ruled that sanctuary policies were legal and withholding funds was unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals how female bonobos maintain dominance over males in their societies through forming coalitions. Researchers tracking bonobo communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo for nearly 30 years found that females band together to attack or intimidate males who step out of line. This behavior allows females to gain social rank, affording them better access to food and mates for their sons. Bonobos are unique among mammals, especially where males are the larger sex, in that they are matriarchal.</p>
