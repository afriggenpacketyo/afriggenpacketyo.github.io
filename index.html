          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from funding Democratic lawmakers who left the state. The order, a victory for Attorney General Ken Paxton, blocks the PAC from paying for travel or lodging for the legislators protesting a Republican-backed redistricting plan. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, accusing Paxton of attempting to suppress dissent and dismantle a major voter registration organization. The legal battle highlights the intense political fight over Texas's new congressional maps.</p>

Bruce, who had no prior foreign policy experience before her appointment as spokesperson, is described by Trump as a "Great Patriot." The nomination has drawn attention to her past as a conservative media personality, her outspoken opposition to transgender rights, and her political evolution from a progressive background. Her appointment awaits confirmation by the Senate.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance participated in high-stakes diplomatic meetings in the United Kingdom with European allies and Ukrainian officials. The talks, held at the UK foreign secretary's estate, reportedly produced significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. This meeting occurred just a day after President Trump announced a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, a move that has raised concerns among European leaders. Ukrainian officials have stressed that any lasting peace must involve their participation and respect their sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly dismissed the upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal made without Ukraine's involvement would be a "dead solution." He emphatically rejected the idea of ceding territory, asserting that "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier" and that Ukraine's constitutional integrity is non-negotiable. His comments directly counter suggestions from President Trump that an agreement might involve a "swapping of territories," highlighting deep Ukrainian anxieties over being marginalized in negotiations.</p>

She served as the first base umpire for the game between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, a milestone celebrated by fans and officials, including the MLB commissioner. After working in the minor leagues since 2016, the 48-year-old's promotion to the majors is a significant moment for the sport.

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at memorial ceremonies in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time is testing the delicate, improving relationship between China and Japan. Lee Yi-yang, who heads Taiwan's de facto embassy in Japan, was present at the events, signaling Taiwan's effort to increase its international visibility and strengthen ties with Tokyo. While observers note that Beijing will view this participation negatively, both China and Japan are expected to react cautiously to avoid derailing their recent diplomatic progress. The move follows a rare visit to Japan by Taiwan's foreign minister.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign nationals after they receive a custodial sentence, rather than after serving part of it. Under the proposal, the decision of whether they serve their sentence abroad would be left to their destination country, potentially allowing some to be freed upon arrival. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, while critics warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.

The IRS declined to share the information it could identify, citing taxpayer privacy rights, a move that appears to have conflicted with the administration's objectives.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Hindi-language film industry, Bollywood, has shifted dramatically over the decades, reflecting the region's changing political landscape. Initially portrayed as a scenic, romantic paradise in the post-independence era, the rise of militancy in the late 1980s transformed its cinematic image into a conflict zone. More recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," are seen by critics as aligning more closely with the Indian government's nationalist narratives. This evolution highlights how popular culture often mirrors and shapes public perception of complex geopolitical issues.</p>

          <h2>South Korea Reports North Korea is Dismantling Propaganda Loudspeakers at Border</h2>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the heavily fortified inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers earlier in the week, a step taken by the new liberal government to de-escalate tensions. For months, the two nations had engaged in Cold War-style psychological warfare, blasting propaganda messages from the South and irritating sounds from the North. While a positive step, tensions may rise again with upcoming U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her forthcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied the existence of a conspiracy to ruin her predecessor and mentor, the late Alex Salmond. She accuses Salmond of being willing to "destroy the SNP" rather than see it succeed without him and failing to show contrition for his inappropriate behavior towards women. Sturgeon recounts her shock upon learning of the allegations against him and her refusal to intervene in the investigation, which she says marked the end of their political partnership. She describes his claims of a conspiracy as a fabrication.</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers have been injured, one seriously, after one of them stepped on a landmine along the tense border with Cambodia. The incident occurred just days after the two nations agreed to extend a ceasefire that ended recent deadly clashes over disputed territory. The Thai army has accused Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention by laying new mines, calling it a significant obstacle to peace. Cambodia has denied laying new mines, stating the devices are likely remnants from past conflicts that plagued the region for decades.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will hold a press conference on Monday, claiming it will "essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." This follows his recent threats to assume federal control of the city's police force and deploy the National Guard. The announcement comes after a White House staffer was assaulted and amid a ramp-up of federal law enforcement presence in the capital. While Trump has characterized the city as one of the most dangerous in the world, official data shows significant drops in violent crime rates over the past year.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to temporarily halt arms exports to Israel that could be used in Gaza has sparked division within his own conservative political alliance. Some members of the CDU/CSU have criticized the move as a departure from Germany's long-standing policy of special responsibility towards Israel. However, the decision has also garnered support from other conservatives and from Germany's junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, who called it a correct and inevitable reaction to the Israeli government's recent actions. The debate highlights the complex political balancing act within German foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the suspected gunman in a fatal shooting near the CDC and Emory University campus in Atlanta as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White. The attack on Friday left a DeKalb County police officer, David Rose, dead before the suspect was also found deceased. The shooting, which involved a long gun, prompted a massive police response and a lockdown of the area. While a motive is still under investigation, law enforcement sources are exploring the possibility that the gunman held anti-vaccine beliefs and thought he was ill from a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, this summer has been analyzed by a planetary geologist and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old. This makes the space rock about 20 million years older than our own planet. The rock is believed to have originated from the breakup of a large asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The incident, which followed a bright fireball seen across the state, marks the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia.</p>
