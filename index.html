          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce new proposals requiring migrants to demonstrate societal contribution to gain indefinite leave to remain. The plan includes conditions such as learning English to a high standard, maintaining a clean criminal record, and performing community volunteering. This policy aims to create a clear distinction from the government and Reform UK, which has proposed more drastic changes to the settlement process, highlighting immigration as a key political battleground for the upcoming conference.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD is implementing significant price cuts in Japan to boost its sluggish sales in a market dominated by domestic brands like Toyota. Despite opening numerous sales locations, the company has sold just over 5,000 vehicles since early 2023 and is now offering discounts up to 1 million yen (US$6,700). This strategy, while successful in China, is risky in Japan where it could alienate early buyers and negatively impact resale values, highlighting the challenges foreign automakers face in the country.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing criticism from the business community, which feels let down after the party's pre-election pro-business campaign. Business leaders, including former Conservative supporter John Caudwell, have expressed a "desperate loss of faith" following a budget that included a £25 billion rise in employers' National Insurance. While the government highlights major tech investments, smaller businesses report feeling forgotten as they grapple with rising costs, increased business rates, and new employment regulations.</p>

          <p>West Ham has hired Nuno Espirito Santo as its new manager, replacing Graham Potter, as the team sits 19th in the Premier League. The appointment signals a potential return to a more pragmatic, counter-attacking style, similar to that of former manager David Moyes, after attempts at a possession-based approach failed. Nuno is known for organizing defensively solid teams that attack with speed, a system that analysts believe suits the current squad's strengths, particularly players like Jarrod Bowen.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, with the CSI 300 index climbing approximately 16%, driven by optimism in AI and technology sectors. However, some experts are questioning whether this surge, largely fueled by retail investors shifting savings into equities, is disconnected from the country's weakening economic fundamentals. While policy support and liquidity are positive factors, concerns are growing that parts of the market may be overheating and approaching bubble territory as broader economic data shows signs of a slowdown.
