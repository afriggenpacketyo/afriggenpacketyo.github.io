          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh achieved a significant milestone by hitting his 57th home run of the season against the Houston Astros, breaking Ken Griffey Jr.'s long-standing single-season record for the franchise.

Raleigh, who leads the majors in home runs, has also set new MLB records for homers by a switch-hitter and a catcher this season, surpassing Mickey Mantle and Salvador Perez respectively.

Her friends welcome the potential extradition, which would mark the first time a British soldier faces trial abroad for a civilian's murder. The article details Wanjiru's challenging life, the tragic discovery of her body in a septic tank, and the subsequent investigations that highlighted alleged British Army misconduct and cover-ups.

          <p>Evelyn Palla is reportedly set to become the first female CEO of Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, with an official announcement from Transport Minister Patrick Schneider expected on Monday. The 52-year-old, who joined the company in 2019 and previously led its regional subsidiary, DB Regio, will replace Richard Lutz, who was dismissed last month. This significant leadership change comes as the state-owned company grapples with widespread delays and cancellations, which it attributes to old and overloaded infrastructure. The appointment of Palla is part of broader plans to restructure Deutsche Bahn's management and modernize Germany's transport infrastructure.</p>

While British Airways utilized a backup system, many other airlines were affected, and hundreds of flights were delayed throughout Saturday. The National Cyber Security Centre and the European Commission are monitoring the situation, with investigations ongoing into the nature and origin of the attack, though previous major hacks have often been financially motivated.</p>

          <p>A right-wing demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, escalated into violence and chaos on Saturday, as rioters clashed with police, vandalized a political party's office, and set a police car ablaze. Authorities used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesters, who had gathered to demand tougher asylum policies. Both caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders condemned the "shameless violence," which occurred just weeks before a general election. The unrest underscores the heightened political tensions in the country, following Wilders' party's withdrawal from the ruling coalition over migration disputes.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has escalated its clash with so-called sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois that their refusal to honor immigration detainers could lead to federal lawsuits and funding cuts. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons accused these states of obstructing immigration enforcement, claiming their policies release "criminal aliens" into communities. The states, however, maintain that ICE detainers are voluntary requests, not mandates, and that compliance without judicial warrants raises constitutional concerns and potential liability for erroneous detentions.

Despite Smith's absence, the team has performed capably, largely due to the emergence of journeyman replacement catcher Ben Rortvedt.

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in alleviating "brain fog" and improving memory and focus. While extensively researched for athletic performance, recent studies are exploring its impact on female biology, reproductive health, bone health, and brain function, especially during perimenopause. Experts suggest creatine might help by increasing brain energy stores, similar to its effect on muscles, potentially mitigating the effects of stress or sleep deprivation. However, more research is needed, and users should be aware of potential side effects and consult a doctor if they have kidney conditions.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's decision to recognize a Palestinian state in September, coinciding with the UN General Assembly, marks a significant shift in British foreign policy. The move comes amid a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and mounting pressure from Labour MPs and international allies. While critics view it as a symbolic "gesture politics" and Israel condemns it as rewarding terrorism, government sources argue it's a galvanizing moment intended to impact the ground situation and revive the two-state solution. The article delves into the domestic and international pressures influencing this contentious decision.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has implemented new restrictions for journalists, requiring them to agree not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing their credentials and limiting their movement within the facility. This policy change follows a series of recent leaks, with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth asserting that the press does not "run the Pentagon." While the department claims commitment to transparency, the new rules emphasize that information, even if unclassified, must be approved for public release. Critics worry these measures could significantly impede journalistic oversight and accountability, raising concerns about press freedom and access to government operations.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced legislation requiring all public universities to erect a "Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza," featuring a statue of the assassinated activist and signage proclaiming him a "modern civil rights leader." The bill mandates specific statue designs and threatens monthly fines for non-compliance, alongside automatic expulsion for students defacing memorials. This move follows efforts on the right to compare Kirk to figures like Martin Luther King Jr., a comparison King's son has explicitly rejected, citing Kirk's divisive rhetoric. The proposal underscores the politicization of Kirk's legacy and conservative efforts to shape public memory.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including top CIA deputies and Democratic congressional staffers, without prior notification to the White House. This unprecedented move caused significant consternation within the administration, as it lacked proper vetting and appeared to lack a direct presidential directive. The revocations were reportedly part of an effort to address perceived politicization of intelligence, particularly concerning Russia's influence operations. The episode has deepened existing animosity between Gabbard and the CIA, highlighting ongoing tensions over intelligence community oversight and political accountability within the government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a direct threat to Afghanistan, stating that "bad things" would happen if the country does not return control of the Bagram air base to the United States. Trump, who declined to rule out military action, reiterated his demand for the base, which served as the primary American military hub during the two-decade war. Afghan officials have expressed strong opposition to a renewed U.S. presence, and U.S. officials privately caution that re-occupying the base would resemble a re-invasion, requiring significant troops and advanced air defenses.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning law enforcement officers from wearing masks on duty, with exceptions for riot gear, medical masks, and undercover work. Newsom, a frequent critic of President Trump, framed the "No Secret Police Act" as a stand against authoritarianism and a direct response to increased, often masked, immigration enforcement in the state. While the law aims to enhance accountability and transparency, its enforceability against federal agents remains uncertain, potentially leading to legal challenges over state versus federal powers. Local law enforcement groups have opposed the ban, citing safety concerns for their officers and families.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will cease publishing the U.S. Department of Agriculture's annual Household Food Security Report, deeming it "overly politicized" and "rife with inaccuracies." This decision follows recent legislation signed by President Trump that significantly reduced food aid, which is estimated to impact millions of people by making them ineligible for food stamps. Critics argue the move is a deliberate attempt to obscure the impact of these cuts and hinder the accurate measurement of hunger in America. The USDA, however, claims the data is subjective and does not reflect improving economic conditions under the current administration. (not investment advice)</p>
