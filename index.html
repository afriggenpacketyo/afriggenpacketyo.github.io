          <p>Valeria Marquez, a 23-year-old beauty influencer, was murdered while broadcasting live on TikTok at her salon in Zapopan, Mexico. The article reports that Marquez was shot twice after responding to someone off-screen, shocking the nation and online community, where she had over 200,000 followers. Authorities are investigating the case as a femicide, with local media suggesting the shooter may have posed as someone bringing a gift. The beauty salon's location in Jalisco, known for cartel activity, adds complexity to the investigation, although officials have not confirmed any gang involvement. Mexico is dealing with a femicide problem, having one of the highest rates of femicide in Latin America.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Field Museum of Chicago have uncovered new details about a well-preserved Archaeopteryx fossil, revealing insights into early bird evolution. Using UV light and CT scans, the article reports that researchers identified soft tissues and anatomical traits indicating that Archaeopteryx, while capable of flight, likely spent more time on the ground and could climb trees. The fossil showed the presence of tertials, specialized feathers crucial for flight, suggesting their specific evolution for aerial locomotion. This discovery contributes to ongoing debates about Archaeopteryx's classification as a bird and its flight capabilities, emphasizing the fossil's significance in understanding the transition from dinosaurs to birds.</p>

The article reports that the yacht's tall mast increased its vulnerability to capsizing in high winds, and a deckhand's delayed response in alerting the captain contributed to the fast-moving catastrophe.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars. The article reports that the brothers were previously serving life sentences without parole for the 1989 killings of their parents, but claim they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with relatives expressing joy and the District Attorney stating his opposition to their release.

          <p>President Trump's plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar has created a rare moment of defiance among his staunchest allies. According to the article, concerns over security and ethics have led to criticism from conservatives who view the gift as a departure from Trump's "America First" policy. While Trump defends the gift as a necessary upgrade to Air Force One, critics argue it poses security risks and clashes with his economic agenda. The potential transaction has also put congressional Republicans in an awkward position, with some expressing concerns and others remaining largely silent.</p>

          <p>The UK will now permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new legislation. According to the article, this move follows a previous ban prompted by a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator by a firm backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. The new law allows State Owned Investors (SOIs) to take a minority stake in UK newspapers, with the government stating that the changes would protect media plurality while helping publishers raise vital funding.

The revival was necessary due to upgrades to an Earth-based antenna, which could have left the probe without a way to save the mission if the thrusters failed.
