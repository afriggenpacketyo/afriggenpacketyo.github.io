          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 14:10:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell nearly 20% to their lowest point since its initial public offering in July. The drop occurred after the company released its first earnings report as a public entity, which largely met expectations but failed to impress investors amid market volatility. While revenue grew 41% year-over-year, the company's forecast for the next quarter and a slight dip in its net retention rate contributed to the stock's slump. The performance is being closely watched as a bellwether for the tech IPO market.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed his government is considering a digital ID program to help tackle illegal immigration by making it harder for individuals without the right to work to find employment. The proposal aims to create a more consistent method for employers to verify identity and reduce the use of fraudulent documents. This move reopens a long-standing debate in the UK over national identity systems, with proponents citing technological advances and critics raising civil liberties concerns.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for an open seat on the Federal Reserve's board, faced intense questioning from Senate Democrats regarding his political independence. Lawmakers expressed concern that Miran, who currently serves as a White House economic adviser, would be unduly influenced by the president, who has publicly attacked the central bank's policies. Miran insisted he would act independently based on economic data, though he confirmed he would take an unpaid leave from his White House role rather than fully resigning.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock declined by more than 5% after the company issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, contributing to a 27% drop for the year. Although second-quarter results exceeded expectations, the guidance raised concerns among investors about the company's growth trajectory. The slump reflects broader anxieties on Wall Street that the rise of artificial intelligence could disrupt the traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, despite CEO Marc Benioff's optimistic outlook on AI-driven transformation.</p>

          <p>During a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voiced agreement with false claims that mRNA vaccines pose dangerous risks. He clashed with Democratic senators over his administration's new policies that limit access to COVID-19 shots for healthy individuals, arguing he was not taking vaccines away from people. Kennedy's testimony amplified concerns among public health experts about the spread of vaccine misinformation from high-level government officials and the politicization of federal health agencies.</p>

          <p>Florida's Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, announced the state's intention to eliminate all existing vaccine mandates, including long-standing requirements for diseases like measles and polio in public schools. Ladapo characterized the current requirements as "immoral," stating that individuals should have the right to make their own health decisions. This policy shift, which critics warn could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases, aligns with the broader vaccine-skeptical agenda of the national Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>EU's Proposed Trade Deal with Mercosur Bloc Draws Opposition from Farmers and Activists</h2>

          <p>The European Commission is advancing a long-negotiated free trade agreement with the South American Mercosur bloc, but the deal faces significant opposition from European farmers and environmentalists. Agricultural groups fear that an influx of cheaper beef, poultry, and sugar imports will create unfair competition and lower food quality standards. Meanwhile, climate activists argue the agreement will accelerate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and undermine environmental protections, prompting calls for its rejection.</p>

          <p>Humanitarian organizations are issuing stark warnings that famine conditions in Gaza are set to worsen as the Israeli military plans a major offensive in Gaza City and imposes new, stricter rules on aid groups. Israel has halted all aid into the city and is requiring NGOs to re-register under conditions many find unacceptable, threatening their ability to operate. With the healthcare system already collapsed, aid providers say the combination of military action and bureaucratic hurdles will create an even larger catastrophe.</p>
