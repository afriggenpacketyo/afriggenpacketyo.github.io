          <p>President Trump has reportedly approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, touting it as a partnership that will create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. Both steelmakers welcomed the decision after a review by federal agencies, which began last month at Trump's request. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh, with the bulk of Nippon Steel's investment occurring over the next 14 months. Nippon Steel applauded Trump's action and committed to protecting American workers and national security.</p>

          <p>As geopolitical tensions rise and discussions about de-dollarization increase, Hong Kong's financial system is becoming crucial for China's efforts to internationalize the yuan. Mary Huen Wai-yi, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, noted that businesses in Qatar are eager to leverage the yuan using Hong Kong's financial tools. Hong Kong offers a large yuan pool and various capabilities, including settlement, payment, and hedging, providing businesses with comfort as they consider investments. This trend reflects a broader shift towards alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade and investment, aligning with China's long-term strategy to assert financial independence.</p>

          <p>NHS England plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade to reduce overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, providing specialist staff to treat people in acute mental distress. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the new model of care, stating that it will provide the right support in the right setting and speed up access to appropriate care. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing of the model before national rollout.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization in the manhunt for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited controversy, with civil rights groups and politicians raising concerns about privacy and constitutional rights. Project N.O.L.A., a nonprofit, provided live facial recognition data that helped recapture one fugitive, but critics argue that the technology poses a threat to individual liberties. The ACLU and some members of Congress are calling for a halt to the use of live-feed facial recognition, citing potential for bias and the lack of public awareness about the surveillance. New Orleans police have defended its limited use of the technology in specific cases, such as investigations into significant crimes.</p>

          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter near the Pentagon, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in early May. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, prompting the Pentagon's tower to delay landing clearance for the Black Hawk helicopter. Federal Aviation Administration controllers aborted the landings of two jets out of caution, citing conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems. The Army stated that its initial review found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic, but the NTSB expressed disappointment at the Army releasing investigative information through the media rather than directly to them.</p>

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to offer consumers alternatives amid rising prices and concerns about shortages of domestic rice. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price than Japanese-grown rice, while other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable options, with Aeon aiming to increase overall rice consumption by offering customers freedom of choice. The average price of rice sold at Japanese supermarkets reached a record high, partly due to a poor harvest in 2023.</p>

The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, but some ex-smokers worry about the change in taste and the convenience of rechargeable alternatives. Retailers are seeing a surge in sales of disposable vapes as customers stock up, while concerns rise that some vapers may return to smoking if they cannot access disposable options. Baroness Claire Fox, who quit smoking with the help of disposable vapes, criticizes the ban as counter-productive and prioritizing environmental concerns over public health.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm struck a controversial deal with President Trump to avoid targeting by the federal government. The departures follow an executive order from Trump that sharply limited the firm's interactions with the government, which was later rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises, such as auditing its hiring practices and dedicating funds to pro bono legal services. The deal between Paul Weiss and the Trump administration proved controversial in the legal community, with some firms choosing to sue the administration instead.</p>

Johnson, who was awaiting trial for his alleged role in a home invasion, escaped after inmates flooded a cell, and another inmate helped him over the perimeter fence. The Tangipahoa Parish Jail has a history of jailbreaks, and authorities have placed at least four individuals on administrative leave pending a full review. Johnson was previously among a group of inmates who escaped in May 2024 and was found hiding in a dumpster.</p>

EU leaders have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, expressing a commitment to de-escalation while remaining ready to defend their interests.

          <p>Investigators are examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches at a San Diego airport that cut off lights meant to guide pilots may have played a role in a fatal plane crash. A Cessna 550 crashed early Thursday into a residential neighbourhood, burning cars and destroying at least one home. Authorities say all six aboard are presumed dead, including a former drummer for the rock band The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent. The airport was experiencing two separate issues at the time of the crash, Mr Baker said. The Automated Surface Observing Station, which provides weather data to pilots, was "inoperative at the time of the accident due to an unrelated power surge". At the time, foggy conditions had been reported throughout the area.</p>
