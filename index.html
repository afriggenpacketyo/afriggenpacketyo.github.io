          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a thorough examination of the Federal Reserve, extending beyond recent controversies to assess its overall effectiveness. Amid tensions between the White House and the central bank, Bessent questioned whether the Fed has successfully fulfilled its mission, comparing the need for review to standards applied to other federal agencies after repeated errors. He also supported the idea of easing interest rates, criticizing the Fed's mindset and noting that feared inflation from tariffs has not materialized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has issued a warning, projecting a significant net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) for the first half of the year. The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Fiat, attributes the downturn to a combination of factors including U.S. tariffs, increased industrial costs, and strategic actions to improve long-term profitability. This unexpected announcement highlights the substantial challenges facing the new CEO, as the company also reported a 6% year-on-year decline in second-quarter vehicle shipments.</p>

          <h2>Right-Wing Populist Parties Gain in Japanese Election, Weakening Ruling Coalition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 09:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its parliamentary majority following significant gains by right-wing populist parties in Sunday's election. This outcome signals a rise in political polarization and instability, driven by voter dissatisfaction with declining real wages and increased immigration. While Ishiba has vowed to remain in office, his government is now vulnerable to no-confidence votes and potential internal party rebellion. The two main beneficiaries were the young, right-wing Sanseito and Democratic Party for the People, which capitalized on voter discontent.</p>

          <p>A former senior Ukrainian anti-crime official, Ihor Hrushevskyi, was discovered dead in a swimming pool at a resort in Villajoyosa, Spain. The incident is notable as it occurred at the same apartment complex where a Russian military helicopter pilot who had defected to Ukraine was assassinated in February 2024. While Spanish authorities noted no initial signs of violence, they are not ruling out foul play in the suspicious death of the 61-year-old. The complex is a popular location for both Russian and Ukrainian expatriates, adding a layer of intrigue to the investigation.</p>

          <p>Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi has been charged with possessing ammunition as part of an investigation into his alleged role in facilitating terrorist activities during recent anti-government protests. Authorities claim the 42-year-old helped organize violent unrest last month, while his supporters maintain his innocence and view the charges as politically motivated. Mwangi, a well-known critic of state repression and police brutality, was arrested after police said they found teargas canisters and a blank round at his home. His case has drawn significant attention amid renewed protests in Kenya.</p>

          <p>British television star Ulrika Jonsson, 57, has pushed back against social media comments criticizing her for looking old and overly tanned in a recent podcast interview. Jonsson explained that she often avoids makeup due to a lifelong battle with eczema, which makes wearing it painful. In an Instagram post, she urged people to listen to her words about her battle with alcohol addiction rather than focusing on her appearance. Having been sober for over a year, she stated that she embraces her age and is not ashamed of her sun-worshipping past.</p>

With nearly half of working-age adults not saving into a private pension, the commission will explore ways to boost retirement savings, particularly among the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups. The Department for Work and Pensions highlighted stark disparities, including a significant gender gap in private pension wealth.

A report from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) argues that expanding the market through increased demand can create a more favorable environment for businesses. The analysts suggest that companies should focus on research and development to offer differentiated products, breaking the self-defeating pattern where firms invest more resources for diminishing returns.

This trend is driven by anxieties over trade wars, geopolitical tensions, and a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar, reinforcing gold's traditional role as a store of value during uncertain times.

          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a century-old shipwreck off its coast as a nursery to reintroduce rare native flat oysters to the North Sea. Scientists deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to re-establish reefs that are crucial for marine ecosystems but have been decimated by overfishing and disease. These oyster reefs purify water and provide vital habitat for other species. The shipwreck was chosen because it is a protected heritage site where disruptive activities like fishing are banned, providing a safe haven for the molluscs to grow and reproduce.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that Chief Justice John Roberts has been instrumental in constitutionally legitimizing President Donald Trump's expansive use of executive power. Through key majority opinions, Roberts has upheld controversial actions like the "Muslim ban" and has advanced a "unitary executive" theory that centralizes authority in the president, weakening congressional checks and balances. This judicial philosophy, which critics argue is ahistorical, has created a framework where the president has nearly untrammeled power over the executive branch. The article suggests this has transformed the American presidency into something dangerously close to what Trump desires: the right to do whatever he wants.</p>
