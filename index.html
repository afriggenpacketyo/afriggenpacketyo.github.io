          <p>Leicester City has appointed former Queens Park Rangers head coach Marti Cifuentes as their new manager on a three-year contract. The club, recently relegated to the Championship, is seeking stability after significant managerial turnover and faces challenges including potential points deductions for financial rule breaches. Cifuentes is expected to implement a modern, possession-heavy style of football similar to his predecessor, but he faces a tight schedule to prepare the squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is accelerating its efforts to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals by taking direct equity stakes in domestic mining companies. The Pentagon recently became the largest shareholder in MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S., to bolster the supply chain for materials essential for military technology like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership model is part of a broader strategy to strengthen America's industrial base for national security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly limited the ability of immigrants in detention to receive bond hearings, effectively expanding mandatory detention. Through a reinterpretation of existing law, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) now argues that noncitizens who entered the U.S. illegally are generally ineligible for release on bond, regardless of how long they have lived in the country. This policy shift means their only path to release is through discretionary parole by ICE officials, not an immigration judge.</p>

While Torode denies the allegation, the BBC and the production company stated that action was necessary, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy for racist language.</p>

          <p>A number of Jewish leaders and activists in New York City are voicing significant concern over the Democratic mayoral nomination of Zohran Mamdani, with some warning of a potential "Jewish exodus" if he is elected. Critics point to what they describe as his anti-Zionist positions and his sponsorship of a bill targeting funding for Israeli organizations as evidence of a threat to the Jewish community amid rising antisemitism. Mamdani has denied these claims and affirmed his commitment to condemning antisemitism.</p>

The existence of both the data breach and the subsequent relocation program was concealed from the public by a super-injunction, which has now been lifted by a High Court judge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant new arms package for Ukraine and issued a 50-day ultimatum to Russia to agree to a ceasefire. He threatened to impose "severe tariffs" on Russia and its trading partners if the deadline is not met, signaling a sharp increase in White House frustration over the prolonged conflict. In response, the Kremlin dismissed the threats as a "theatrical ultimatum," with one official stating that Russia "didn't care," indicating continued high tensions.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced that it plans to restart shipments of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, a significant development after a period of U.S. export restrictions. The U.S. Commerce Department is set to resume reviewing the company's license applications, a move that comes after extensive lobbying from the chip industry to ease trade controls. This signals a potential policy shift from the Trump administration regarding high-tech exports to China, which had been curtailed over national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that Representative James Comer, the Republican chairman leading an investigation into President Biden's use of an autopen, has himself used a digital signature on official letters and subpoena notices. This finding introduces a layer of political irony to the Republican-led inquiry, which was initiated based on claims that Biden was not in control of the documents he was signing. A spokesperson for Comer's committee defended the practice for correspondence but stated that legally binding subpoenas are always physically signed.</p>
