          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will re-enter the cryptocurrency investment market after being forced to exit in 2023 as a condition of receiving a bank charter. The decision comes after new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, signaling a shift in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. SoFi plans to aggressively expand its crypto offerings, including integrating blockchain capabilities across its product lines, and aims to offer crypto investing by year-end. The company envisions future products such as crypto-backed loans and crypto payment options, potentially accelerating this process through acquisitions.</p>

          <p>General Motors exceeded Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 and revenue of $44.02 billion. However, the company is reassessing its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainty surrounding potential cost increases stemming from President Trump's auto tariffs. GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated that the previous guidance should not be relied upon until further clarity is achieved, and any future stock buybacks are temporarily suspended. Despite profit margins being down compared to the previous year, GM described their first-quarter results as "very strong", citing solid fundamentals and making adjustments to manufacturing plans due to the tariffs.

          <p>Chinese and American analysts have expressed shared concerns about the instability and chaos stemming from President Trump's trade war with China and his foreign policy decisions. At a Hong Kong event, experts from both countries acknowledged that Trump's unpredictability and "America first" approach have intensified superpower rivalry and contributed to global market turmoil. While differing on the root causes of US-China tensions, analysts agreed that Trump's actions exacerbate existing structural differences between the two nations, creating an "extraordinarily fluid period" due to the lack of predictability in Washington.</p>

          <p>Pfizer reported first-quarter profits that exceeded estimates, despite a drop in sales largely due to declining revenue from its COVID-19 pill, Paxlovid. The pharmaceutical company is expanding its cost-cutting efforts, now expecting additional savings of $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, primarily in selling, informational, and administrative expenses.

          <h2>Venmo's Revenue Soars as Monetization Efforts Gain Traction</h2>

          <p>Venmo, a subsidiary of PayPal, is experiencing significant revenue growth, with a 20% year-over-year increase in the first quarter. This growth reflects PayPal's increasing monetization of the platform, which has long been popular but criticized for its lack of revenue generation. While Venmo's total payment volume rose 10%, revenue grew at twice that rate, indicating the success of monetization efforts. Venmo generates revenue from specific products like Pay with Venmo, Venmo debit cards, and instant transfers, but not from peer-to-peer payments.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's initial distancing from Project 2025, many of his administration's policies in the first 100 days closely mirror the initiative's blueprint for overhauling the executive branch. Actions such as abolishing the Department of Education, ending DEI practices, and shifting FEMA costs to states align with Project 2025's recommendations. The administration's approach to agencies like NPR and PBS, as well as its restrictions on gender-affirming care and refugee admissions, also reflect the policy guide's proposals, demonstrating a significant overlap between Trump's agenda and the conservative roadmap.</p>

          <p>President Trump has made progress on several campaign promises during his first 100 days, primarily through executive orders, while others remain unfulfilled. He delivered on pardoning January 6 rioters and releasing JFK assassination records but has yet to end the Russia-Ukraine war or make IVF free. Actions like withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, imposing tariffs, and attempting to close the Education Department align with his campaign pledges, though some are facing legal challenges or require Congressional action. The status of these promises reflects a mix of fulfilled commitments and ongoing efforts to implement his agenda.</p>

Voters are expressing their concerns about the Trump administration's policies and a lack of representation, while Cammack defends her accessibility through other means.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the erosion of truth and trust in American politics, particularly during President Trump's second term, arguing that falsehoods are becoming increasingly normalized. The author draws on Walter Lippmann's theories about public opinion and the power of images to illustrate how propaganda and misinformation can undermine democracy. The loss of trust in institutions and the rise of partisan narratives are contributing to a political climate where feelings often outweigh facts, leading to a breakdown in accountability and an expansion of executive power.</p>

          <p>Economist David Autor, known for his research on the "China shock," argues that President Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs, will weaken American manufacturing and potentially cause greater economic damage than before. Autor believes that Trump's approach of imposing sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports is counterproductive, as it raises input costs for U.S. industries and undermines their competitiveness. Instead, he advocates for targeted protections combined with government investments in key sectors like semiconductors and electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The first 100 days of President Trump's second term have been marked by a clash between his determination to rule and his inability to govern, setting the country on an unsustainable course. His administration has smashed democratic norms, crippled the federal bureaucracy, and realigned America against its traditional allies, prioritizing loyalty over competence. The trade-off between loyalty and competence has been evident as Trump's mismanagement and the consolidation of power have created a weaponized, illiberal state, and a smoldering political backlash.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring pro-natalist policies, including baby bonuses, to encourage Americans to have more children. While such policies are common in other countries, concerns arise about their potential to bolster a political agenda focused on traditional gender roles and reproductive oppression, and the administration's broader agenda including potential tariffs that could dramatically increase the cost of raising children. Experts caution that such policies may distract from deeper societal investments parents actually need, such as affordable childcare and paid parental leave.</p>
