          <p>Boy and girl scouts in Kyoto participated in harvesting "Ofuku Ume" plums at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine, a practice believed to bring good luck for the New Year. Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, gathered plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. These plums are pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, and drinking tea made from them on New Year's Day is thought to promote good health and ward off illness. The scouts carefully hand-picked plums that were between three to four centimeters in diameter, expressing their enjoyment of the tradition.</p>

          <p>Following recent attacks between Iran and Israel, residents across the Middle East expressed a mix of anxiety, frustration, and hope. The conflict, which included missile strikes on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, prompted many to seek shelter and raised concerns about regional stability. Some individuals viewed the events as a "big show" with the U.S. emerging as the primary beneficiary, while others voiced fears of escalating tensions and the potential for further destabilization. Despite the uncertainty, many expressed a desire for peace and a return to focusing on resolving other regional conflicts.</p>

          <p>An article critiques Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America healthy again" plan for overlooking the two leading causes of death for American children: gun violence and road traffic accidents. The article highlights that gun injuries surpassed car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the U.S. in 2020, and that the U.S. has significantly higher rates of gun-related deaths compared to other developed countries. Similarly, the article points out the high rate of road traffic fatalities in the U.S. compared to countries like Japan, attributing this to factors like vehicle size. The author asserts that addressing these issues is crucial for any successful public health initiative.</p>

          <p>The number of students attending Japanese schools in China has decreased by over 10% in the academic year starting in April, marking a concerning trend. This decline is attributed to an economic downturn in China and heightened safety concerns among Japanese expatriate communities. These concerns arose after a knife attack near Shanghai in June of the previous year, which injured Japanese nationals, and a fatal stabbing of a Japanese boy in Shenzhen in September. Local authorities and the Japanese school in Suzhou have increased security measures, but parents remain vigilant and are prepared to return to Japan if their children face danger.</p>

While the CMA is not currently accusing Google of anti-competitive practices, it has outlined a "roadmap" of potential changes ahead of a final decision in October.

          <p>The article discusses President Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, highlighting that his administration disregarded the consensus of the US intelligence community. For nearly two decades, US intelligence agencies have maintained that while Iran has a uranium enrichment program, it has not built atomic bombs. Trump's willingness to listen to Israel over his own experts, combined with an ideological purge within the national security community, has led to a situation where expert opinions on Iran are being ignored. This approach echoes past intelligence failures, such as the miscalculation regarding Saddam Hussein's weapons program, and raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the information guiding US foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel is forcing airlines to reroute flights, potentially causing greater disruption for Western carriers compared to their Chinese counterparts. Western airlines, already barred from Russian airspace, face more limited options for avoiding dangerous airspace over Iran and the Middle East. Chinese airlines, however, can utilize Russian airspace, giving them a competitive advantage in terms of airfare and flight times. The situation highlights the complex geopolitical factors influencing the aviation industry and the varying impacts on different airlines.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing potential financial challenges in meeting NATO's new defense spending target of 5% of GDP. This increase would require additional tens of billions of euros annually, potentially necessitating tax hikes, budget cuts, and increased borrowing. Experts suggest that while Germany's relaxed debt brake provides short-term flexibility, the long-term implications include higher interest costs and potential conflicts with EU fiscal rules. The feasibility of fully financing the increased defense spending through loans remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A Liverpool MP, Ian Byrne, expressed concerns that a weakened Hillsborough Law, lacking a "duty of candour" for public officials, would fail to gain support from families affected by the disaster. Byrne wrote to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, urging him to ensure that the bill includes an obligation for public servants to tell the truth. The Hillsborough Law aims to prevent cover-ups in major disasters and provide legal funding to those affected, but Byrne fears that the current draft falls short of these goals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell defended his department's tactics during recent protests, asserting that officers acted appropriately to quell unrest. He pushed back against criticism regarding the use of hard foam projectiles and mounted units, stating that officers encountered dangerous and violent conditions. McDonnell said the department would evaluate each use-of-force incident, but also cited numerous cases of officers being attacked. The chief disputed allegations of indiscriminate force, stating that actions were targeted and proportional to immediate threats.</p>
