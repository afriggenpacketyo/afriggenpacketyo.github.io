          <p>Irish police report that violence during a protest outside Dublin's Citywest Hotel, which houses asylum seekers, was orchestrated online by "disparate groups" aiming to stir up hatred. Six arrests were made, with five individuals charged, after gardaí faced sustained attacks with bricks, fireworks, and glass bottles. The protest erupted following an alleged sexual assault of a young girl, but authorities distinguish between peaceful protesters and "violent thugs." A full policing and security operation remains in place, with the Taoiseach condemning the "vile abuse" against officers and the Justice Minister promising a forceful response to those seeking to sow dissent in society.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named Atlantic storm, formed over the Caribbean and is expected to deliver 5 to 10 inches of rain to the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica. Currently moving west-northwest with 50 mph winds, it could strengthen into a hurricane by Thursday, prompting a hurricane watch for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Significant flash flooding and landslides are possible in affected areas, with additional heavy rainfall anticipated beyond Saturday. Despite the regional threat, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center indicates Melissa is currently unlikely to impact the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>The wife of Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian man killed in a US military strike in the Caribbean, claims he was an innocent fisherman, not a drug trafficker as alleged by the White House. Carranza was among at least 32 individuals killed in strikes targeting suspected drug boats, with his family denying any link to narcotics. Colombian President Gustavo Petro supports the family's claim, calling the operation an "assassination" and a violation of sovereignty, sparking a diplomatic dispute. The US decertified Colombia as a drug-fighting ally, leading Colombia to halt US arms purchases, escalating tensions between historically close partners.</p>

          <p>Storm Benjamin, named by Météo France, is set to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the United Kingdom on Thursday, with yellow weather warnings issued across much of England and Wales. Rainfall totals could widely reach 20-30mm, with some areas seeing up to 50mm, potentially causing localized flooding and travel disruption. While the UK anticipates a typical autumnal stormy day with relatively minor impacts, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are bracing for more severe conditions, including gusts up to 80mph. The storm's naming by France underscores its greater threat to continental Europe, ensuring consistent communication across nations.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem to discuss plans for post-war Gaza's governance and security, aiming for a "completely new vision" for the region. Vance expressed optimism for the Gaza ceasefire holding and potentially unlocking broader regional alliances, despite acknowledging the "very tough task" ahead. However, the diplomatic context is marred by a significant increase in violent assaults by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank during the olive harvest, leaving at least one woman seriously injured. The UN reports a 13% rise in such attacks this year, underscoring ongoing instability.</p>

          <p>Hunter Biden reportedly expressed intense anger over former President Barack Obama guiding President Joe Biden offstage with a guiding hand at a June 2024 fundraiser, viewing it as disrespectful and embarrassing. According to a new book by ABC News' Jonathan Karl, Hunter stated he "almost jumped up on the stage" to intervene, fearing the incident would become a negative meme. The younger Biden insisted his father was simply acknowledging the crowd, but the event fueled ongoing criticism about President Biden's age and perceived need for direction. The White House had previously dismissed similar clips for using an "artificially narrow frame."</p>

          <p>Russia is reportedly anxious after US President Donald Trump unexpectedly put a planned summit with Vladimir Putin on hold, citing a desire to avoid a "wasted meeting." The decision came after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated Moscow's opposition to an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, maintaining its stance since an earlier meeting. Despite Trump's remarks, the Kremlin insisted that summit dates were never formally set and preparations are ongoing, downplaying the halt. This marks another shift in the US administration's fluctuating stance on Russia and the Ukraine conflict, causing uncertainty in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Following intense lobbying by the gun industry and Republican politicians, the Trump administration has reclassified federal firearms examiners as "essential" workers, allowing sales of highly regulated weapons to resume during the government shutdown. These items, including silencers, short-barreled rifles, and vintage machine guns, had been halted due to furloughs at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Critics, like the Violence Policy Center, argue this prioritizes firearms sales over other critical public services.

          <p>Florida's Brightline, a high-speed passenger train, is under intense scrutiny due to its alarming fatality rate, having been involved in at least 185 deaths since 2017, with 148 not believed to be suicides. Despite its modern design and efficiency, the train's accident rate is more than double that of other commuter lines. Investigations by the NTSB have not blamed equipment failure or operator error, with Brightline attributing incidents to "reckless behavior" by individuals. Experts, however, point to the numerous "at grade" crossings in densely populated areas and increased train frequency and speed as major contributing factors to the unusual number of fatalities.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has awarded this year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Andrzej Poczobut of Belarus and Mzia Amaglobeli of Georgia, both currently imprisoned for their journalistic work. Poczobut, a Polish-Belarusian correspondent, received an eight-year sentence in 2023 for critical reporting against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Amaglobeli, a Georgian journalist, was jailed for two years in August for investigations into public spending and abuse of office. The award recognizes their courage as symbols in the struggle for freedom and democracy, highlighting the severe risks faced by journalists globally.</p>

          <p>The grandchildren of Ruth Ellis, the last woman hanged in Britain in 1955 for murdering her lover David Blakely, are seeking a posthumous conditional pardon, citing her experience of severe physical and emotional domestic abuse. Ellis suffered a miscarriage after being punched by Blakely, and her family argues her conviction and mandatory death sentence did not account for this context, which would now be considered a defense. This legal challenge aims to correct a historical injustice, acknowledging past failures in the justice system, and sending a clear message about violence against women.</p>

          <p>A devastating multi-vehicle crash involving two buses and two other vehicles on a highway in western Uganda has killed at least 46 people and injured many more, in one of the country's worst recent motor accidents. Police initially reported 63 fatalities but revised the toll, clarifying some victims were unconscious. The head-on collision occurred when two bus drivers attempted to overtake other vehicles. Authorities attribute frequent fatal crashes in Uganda to speeding and careless passing, urging maximum caution as road deaths continue to rise annually, with a road safety campaigner describing the situation as "anarchy."</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris has reopened three days after a brazen daylight robbery saw French crown jewels, valued at 88 million euros, stolen from its Apollo Gallery. Thieves used power tools and scooters in the eight-minute heist, though an attempted vehicle fire was thwarted by museum staff. President Emmanuel Macron has urged expedited security measures, as a preliminary report indicated a third of Louvre rooms lacked CCTV and the gallery's specific alarm had recently been broken.

          <p>This article explores the concept of "best friends" and the psychological benefits of prioritizing these deep connections for overall well-being. Research suggests that the quality of a few close friendships, rather than the quantity, is a strong predictor of individual happiness and can stave off emotional loneliness. Experts highlight qualities like trust, disclosure, and unwavering support as hallmarks of best friendships, noting that people subconsciously rank their social connections. The article argues that understanding and investing emotional resources in one's inner circle allows for a greater return on emotional investment and enhanced life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>UK inflation eased to 3.8% in September, below the feared 4%, offering relief to households, the government, and the Bank of England. While food prices showed signs of settling, inflation in services remains stubborn, partly due to rising wage bills. Economists anticipate inflation will continue to fall towards the 2% target next year, with average wage rises now comfortably outpacing inflation for many. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hinted at energy bill relief in the upcoming Budget, but businesses warn against further tax hikes that could reignite inflationary pressures. A potential "Santa cut" in interest rates in December is now being considered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California business leaders are proposing a ballot initiative, the "Building an Affordable California Act," to overhaul the state’s environmental review process (CEQA) and expedite housing and infrastructure projects. The measure aims to establish stringent timelines for environmental oversight, requiring most essential projects, such as affordable housing and clean energy, to receive approvals within 365 days. Proponents argue CEQA is outdated and contributes to the state's high cost of living, while environmentalists contend it is crucial for protecting natural resources and vulnerable communities.

          <p>A new study provides compelling evidence that cognitive training can boost acetylcholine levels, a brain chemical typically declining with age, in people 65 and older. A 10-week regimen of rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes daily increased acetylcholine by 2.3% in brain areas vital for attention and memory, effectively turning back the clock by about a decade. This finding supports previous animal research and suggests that scientifically tested brain-training programs, like BrainHQ, can have a significant and notable effect on cognitive performance. Even modest changes in this neuromodulator can profoundly impact memory and thinking.</p>
