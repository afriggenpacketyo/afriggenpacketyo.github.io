          <p>Following a call from President Donald Trump, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will propose a rule change to potentially switch corporate earnings reports from a quarterly to a semiannual schedule. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins stated the proposal would allow the market to consider the change, which supporters argue would encourage long-term business focus. Opponents, however, express concern that less frequent reporting could harm transparency for investors, particularly retail investors who lack the resources of large institutions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has called for two more interest rate cuts this year, arguing that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs is likely a temporary, one-time effect. Despite inflation running above the Fed's 2% target, Kashkari believes a weakening labor market provides room for more accommodative monetary policy to support the economy. His dovish stance suggests a desire to act preemptively to avoid a more significant slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve implementing an interest rate cut, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to a two-week high. This counterintuitive market reaction reflects investor sentiment that the economy may be stronger than previously thought, buoyed by positive jobless claims data. Investors in longer-term debt are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, including future economic growth, inflation, and government borrowing needs, leading to the upward pressure on yields.

          <p>A new report from the House Select Committee on China warns that American universities are educating numerous Chinese nationals with direct ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The investigation found that these students are often involved in federally funded research in sensitive STEM fields, effectively using U.S. taxpayer money to advance Beijing's military ambitions. The committee has called for stricter visa screening and has urged universities to increase transparency regarding foreign student affiliations and funding sources.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that the Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security is allegedly using a new tactic to accelerate deportations by circumventing the judicial process. Government lawyers are reportedly moving to dismiss long-standing immigration cases, which appears to be a victory for the asylum seeker, only for ICE agents to immediately arrest the individual outside the courtroom for "expedited removal." This strategy effectively turns a procedural dismissal into a trap, stripping individuals of their due process rights within the court system.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that he will designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is facing significant skepticism from legal experts who say he lacks the authority to do so. There is currently no legal mechanism for the U.S. government to label a domestic group as a terrorist organization, partly due to First Amendment concerns. Furthermore, experts note that antifa is a decentralized movement and ideology, not a structured organization, which would make such a designation legally and practically difficult to enforce.</p>

          <p>A three-bedroom home in Gwynedd, north Wales, is being sent to auction with a guide price of £38,000, but it comes with a significant catch: it is completely filled with rubbish. The property, which belonged to a deceased woman, is being sold "as seen," and the auctioneers will not be removing any of the contents. Due to health and safety concerns, potential buyers are being advised against in-person viewings, making it a challenging but potentially rewarding project for an investor.</p>

          <p>Sir Richard Moore, the departing chief of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency, delivered a stark assessment of the war in Ukraine, stating there is "absolutely no evidence" that Russian President Vladimir Putin desires a peaceful resolution. In a public speech, Moore accused Putin of lying to the world, his own people, and possibly himself about Russia's prospects for victory. He asserted that Putin is merely "stringing us along" while seeking to impose his imperial will through force.</p>

          <p>British cyclist Tom Pidcock has voiced concern for rider safety after the Vuelta a España was repeatedly disrupted by pro-Palestinian protests, which specifically targeted the Israel-Premier Tech team. The demonstrations led to crashes, stages being ended early, and riders being physically impeded, with Pidcock describing one incident where a teammate was pushed off his bike. He stated that while he would not comment on the politics, the actions of protesters were overstepping and creating a dangerous environment for all competitors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, after his office failed to find sufficient evidence to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to sources, Trump administration officials had pressured Siebert to pursue the case against one of the president's chief political adversaries. The move to oust him has heightened concerns about the weaponization of the Department of Justice for political retribution.</p>

          <p>A Taliban foreign ministry official has rejected President Trump's recent suggestion that the U.S. could retake Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. The official, Zakir Jalal, stated on social media that the possibility of any foreign military presence was "completely rejected" during the Doha negotiations that preceded the U.S. withdrawal. Trump had hinted at reclaiming the strategic base, citing its proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites, a claim that has been previously scrutinized.</p>

When questioned about the mental difficulty of their situation, Maresca stated that his 75-year-old father's life as a fisherman is a "hard life," implying the players' circumstances are not comparable. His comments come as the Professional Footballers' Association is in talks with the club to ensure the pair receive adequate training conditions.</p>

          <p>In a rare public admission, a senior official from China's Xinjiang region has acknowledged that U.S. sanctions have negatively impacted the local economy and job market. Chen Weijun, the region's vice-chairman, stated that some businesses have faced export difficulties and reduced production capacity, leading to fewer job opportunities for residents of all ethnic groups, including Uyghurs. This marks the first time a local official has directly confirmed the adverse effects of the sanctions, which were imposed over human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Internal records from U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and CBP, reveal claims that the use of certain emojis could signal affiliation with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The documents list symbols like trains, swords, and strawberries as part of the gang's "code language," a notion that gang experts and immigration attorneys have labeled "ludicrous" and "baseless." Critics warn that this unsubstantiated intelligence could lead to wrongful profiling, detention, and deportation of individuals based on their social media activity.</p>
