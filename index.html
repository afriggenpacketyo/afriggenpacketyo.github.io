          <p>An appeals court has reversed a temporary restraining order, allowing the Trump administration to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland. This decision permits federalizing troops despite objections from local officials, who decried the ruling as failing to hold the president accountable for what they perceive as illegal deployments. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield urges the full Ninth Circuit to vacate the decision, emphasizing the ongoing fight for Oregon's laws and values, and highlighting the president's continued animosity towards the city. The administration cited statutory authority for federalizing the Guard to protect federal property, asserting the legality of the action.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services experienced a major outage, causing widespread disruption to numerous websites and applications for over 12 hours. The issue, stemming from DNS problems with DynamoDB in the US-East-1 region, affected major services like Disney+, Lyft, Reddit, Ring doorbells, and Amazon's own internal operations, including warehouses. While AWS reported early signs of recovery, the incident highlights the world's increasing dependence on a few major cloud providers, demonstrating how a single technical fault can have extensive global repercussions across various sectors. Experts suggest it was a technical fault, not a cyberattack, underscoring the fragility of modern digital infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers rookie Kam Jones was arrested in Indianapolis following a brief police chase for reckless driving and resisting law enforcement. Jones was reportedly speeding at 90 mph in a 55 mph zone on I-65, claiming he was late for practice. The Pacers organization stated they are aware of the situation and gathering more information, offering no further comment at this time. Jones, a former Marquette star, was traded to the Pacers after being drafted by the Spurs and is currently recovering from a back injury, expected to play in the G-League.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has requested a federal judge dismiss his criminal case, alleging vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump's animus. Comey's legal team argues the indictment is flawed because interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who signed the charges, was appointed unlawfully. They seek dismissal with prejudice, citing "flagrant misconduct" and the need to deter unconstitutional prosecutions. The charges, filed just before the statute of limitations expired, relate to Comey's 2020 Senate testimony regarding alleged false statements and obstruction.</p>

          <p>Ian Cleary was sentenced to two to four years in prison for a 2013 campus sexual assault, after sending a Facebook message to the victim, Shannon Keeler, saying, "So I sexual assaulted you." The judge considered Cleary's guilty plea, remorse, and mental illness, leading to a sentence below state guidelines. Keeler delivered a powerful impact statement, detailing her decade-long struggle to pursue charges and the reopening of wounds by the message. Cleary, who later apologized in court, was extradited from France in 2024 after years of evading authorities.</p>

          <p>Hamas, though diminished after two years of war and the loss of key figures, is reasserting authority in Gaza through violence against opponents and looters, despite a ceasefire. While President Trump initially seemed ambivalent, he later hardened his tone, threatening intervention if killings continued. Gazans express mixed views, with some seeing Hamas as a necessary force against gangs, while others fear its continued power and refusal to disarm. The article explores Hamas's history, its tunnel network, and the challenges of establishing a new governance, with some suggesting the group might rebrand politically.</p>

Furthermore, the emergency brake system failed, and oversight by both Carris engineers and an outsourced maintenance company was inadequate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator, stated that Elon Musk's SpaceX is "behind" on the Artemis moon mission timeline, prompting him to reopen contracts to other companies. Duffy emphasized the U.S. goal to return to the moon by 2028 with two potential companies, highlighting Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin as a competitor. Musk responded on X, claiming Blue Origin has never delivered a "useful payload" to orbit or the moon. The decision reflects pressure to accelerate the lunar return amid a "second space race" with China, though the ongoing government shutdown could impact contract processes.</p>

The exchange highlights political divisions within the tech world regarding AI safety and regulation, with Sacks accusing Anthropic of "regulatory capture" and Hoffman advocating for professional dialogue on AI's impact.

          <p>This article introduces "Reparteras," women making inroads in Cuba's urban music scene, reparto, a fusion of reggaetón, timba, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. While the genre often objectifies women and reflects machismo, artists like Seidy La Niña, Melanie Santiler, and Ozunaje are challenging norms and carving out space. They face resistance, double standards, and pressure to conform to beauty ideals, but reclaim derogatory terms and demand to be judged against male counterparts. The article highlights their efforts to evolve reparto's often explicit vocabulary and themes, pushing for fresh perspectives beyond bedroom conquests.</p>

          <p>California's new Pay Equity Enforcement Act, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to significantly reduce the Latina wage gap, the widest in the nation. Effective January 2026, the law strengthens the California Equal Pay Act by updating the definition of "wages" to include non-traditional compensation, requiring "good faith estimates" for job pay, and extending the statute of limitations for wage claims to six years. Championed by State Sen. Monique Limón and organizations like HOPE, the legislation seeks to provide long-term economic gains for Latinas, who despite educational achievements, face systemic barriers and occupational segregation.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's reaction to the "No Kings" protests, where he posted an AI-generated video depicting himself as a fighter pilot dumping sewage on protesters. The author interprets this as a tactic to mock and smear millions of Americans, discouraging his supporters from joining them, akin to authoritarian playbooks used globally. The protests, though diverse, aimed to express public unhappiness with Trump's politicization of justice and usurpation of power. The article suggests this is the beginning of a predictable cycle, questioning whether Americans will be "radicalized" by basic decency or succumb to cynicism.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Border Patrol official testified that agents involved in Chicago immigration enforcement now have body cameras, following a judge's order amidst complaints of combative tactics and over 1,000 arrests. Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick defended the use of tear gas on protesters, stating it was necessary when residents impeded agents from leaving a scene, escalating safety concerns. The hearing is part of a lawsuit by news organizations and community groups challenging the Trump administration's crackdown.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed readiness to join proposed talks between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest, if invited, following a "frank" White House meeting with Trump.

Zelensky, however, insisted on a "just peace" and criticized Hungary as a venue. Despite previous shifts in Trump's stance, his recent comments suggest a more challenging path to resolution, emphasizing the complexities of the ongoing conflict.</p>
