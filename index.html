          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 01:22:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. This strong performance was largely driven by a 3% year-over-year revenue increase in its investment banking division, which helped compensate for a dip in corporate operations. The German lender is navigating challenges from lower interest rates but has benefited from increased European defense spending. However, the bank faces uncertainty from potential U.S. tariffs on EU goods, which could impact Germany's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced a plan to provide monthly subsidy vouchers to its aging population, a notable instance of direct fiscal support aimed at boosting consumption. The electronic coupons, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, are intended for seniors with disabilities to help cover costs for services like meal assistance and day care. This policy seeks to alleviate the financial burden on families and stimulate the elderly-care service market. The move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen the social safety net in response to the country's rapidly graying population.</p>

          <p>The private credit industry is increasingly targeting the Asia-Pacific region to capitalize on a growing funding gap as traditional bank lending recedes. Assets under management in Asian private credit have surged to over $62 billion, attracting major global firms to expand their presence. The article highlights that countries like India and Southeast Asia are drawing significant capital, with a focus on sectors such as infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy. While the market offers substantial growth potential, investors face risks including currency volatility and diverse regulatory environments across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The world's largest olive oil producer, Deoleo, has issued a warning that potential U.S. tariffs of 30% on European Union imports could significantly harm American consumers. The Spanish company stated that since the U.S. imports approximately 95% of its olive oil, the proposed trade measure would likely lead to higher prices and reduced availability of the product. This tariff threat is part of a broader trade dispute between the U.S. and the EU, which also affects other European goods. The article highlights the potential for a supply glut in the EU if U.S. imports decrease.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man has spoken out about his traumatic experience after being deported by the Trump administration to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, despite having no criminal record. Arturo Suarez, an aspiring singer, was arrested in the U.S. and accused of gang membership, a claim he denies, before being sent to the CECOT prison. He described enduring months of physical and psychological abuse alongside dangerous criminals before his release as part of a prisoner swap. His case highlights the severe consequences of the administration's controversial immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a significant change in U.S. immigration policy, instructing border officials to offer migrant teenagers the option of voluntary self-deportation. Under the new directive, unaccompanied minors aged 14 and older will be asked if they want to return to their home countries instead of being transferred to government-run shelters. This policy upends protections from a 2008 anti-trafficking law that previously mandated such minors be placed in the care of Health and Human Services. The administration claims the change is authorized by a new spending law.</p>

          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has cancelled thousands of scheduled water tests over the past three months due to significant staff shortages at its main laboratory. The suspended tests were intended to monitor for harmful inorganic pollutants, such as nitrates and phosphates, which are key indicators of sewage and agricultural runoff in rivers and lakes. According to internal documents shared by campaigners, the regulator has been forced to pause at least seven national testing programs. This reduction in monitoring raises serious concerns about the EA's ability to effectively oversee water quality.</p>

          <p>A rare, vibrant purple sea creature, known as a violet snail, has been discovered on a beach in Southern California, a surprising find for the region. A researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography spotted the Janthina janthina, a species that typically inhabits warmer tropical and subtropical seas. These snails are unique for floating on the ocean surface using a self-secreted bubble raft. The sighting has prompted speculation among scientists that its appearance so far north could be linked to warming ocean waters, a question they will continue to examine.</p>

This strong performance has positioned SK Hynix to challenge its rival Samsung for the top spot in the global memory market. The company anticipates continued growth, expecting its HBM sales for the full year to double compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

This development comes as a federal judge in Florida denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein's 2006 case, citing secrecy rules.
