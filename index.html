            <p>The UK economy demonstrated resilience with a 0.5% expansion in February, surpassing initial forecasts. This growth was largely propelled by a robust performance in the services sector, according to the Office for National Statistics. This positive economic activity suggests a strengthening foundation for the UK's financial outlook amidst global economic uncertainties. The data provides a snapshot of the UK's capacity to adapt and grow despite ongoing challenges. Optimism is tempered by the need for sustained growth in subsequent months. (not investment advice)</p>

            <h2>Economists Doubt China Will Devalue Yuan Aggressively Despite U.S. Tariffs</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 02:09:11 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists predict that China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its yuan to counter the impact of U.S. tariffs, primarily due to concerns about triggering financial market instability and capital outflows. Analysts suggest that a significant weakening of the yuan could lead to a loss of consumer confidence and risk capital flight, complicating Beijing's efforts to manage its already stuttering economy. Instead, the central bank is expected to manage an orderly and gradual depreciation of the currency. This approach aims to mitigate the effects of U.S. tariffs while maintaining financial stability.

            <p>The use of artificial intelligence to reimagine "The Wizard of Oz" for the Las Vegas Sphere has sparked mixed reactions. Some experts believe that while "film purists" may resist the idea, the technology could "breathe new life" into classic films. This AI makeover involves using Google's AI tools to upscale the original film to fit the Sphere's massive screen and create new visual content, expanding the scope of scenes and incorporating composites of the original performances into the expanded environments. The move represents a "total transformation" of the viewing experience and raises questions about artistic integrity and the potential for innovation in film.</p>

            <p>Chinese exporters are facing significant challenges as the U.S. raises tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to increased prices for American consumers and accelerated plans to diversify operations. Some companies are halting shipments entirely, while others are exploring alternative suppliers in countries like Vietnam. The tariffs are expected to significantly impact China's shipments to the U.S., potentially leading to job losses and economic fallout. Beijing is attempting to mitigate the impact by encouraging domestic sales and providing subsidies to exporters, but these measures may not be sufficient to offset the effects of the tariffs.

Retailers are facilitating this trend by labeling European-owned brands, making it easier for shoppers to avoid U.S. products.

            <p>Jordan Belfort, the "Wolf of Wall Street," stated that there's "no way" Donald Trump is guilty of insider trading or market manipulation, even after Trump encouraged people to buy shares before pausing tariffs. Belfort also supports Trump's tariffs and Elon Musk's government efficiency role, even with the job cuts. He believes firms will shift production from China to places such as India, and that exemptions would eventually be agreed. Despite the mid-week surge, turbulence in stock markets appears far from over due to ongoing tariffs.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadorian migrant, was sent to El Salvador's infamous Cecot prison, known for housing gang members. The Supreme Court declined to block the lower court's order to bring Garcia home. The case will now return to the trial court, but the justices did not give the administration a deadline for when Mr Garcia should be returned.</p>

            <p>Doctors and nurses are calling out common health misconceptions, such as getting a cold from being cold or wet, or sugar causing hyperactivity in children. They emphasize that health insurance companies don't always follow the best medical practices, and new treatments may be denied. They also urge people to stop going to urgent cares for viral infections and to be nice to ER staff. It's important to understand that green mucus doesn't always mean a bacterial infection, and taking leftover antibiotics is not effective.</p>
