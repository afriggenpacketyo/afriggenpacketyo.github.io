          <p>Kyiv has accused Russia of involvement in the assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a prominent pro-Western Ukrainian politician and former speaker of parliament. Parubiy was shot and killed in the city of Lviv, and authorities have since arrested a suspect who was allegedly disguised as a courier. Ukraine's national police chief stated there is a "Russian trace" in the carefully planned crime. This event occurs within the broader context of the ongoing war, where both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of carrying out assassinations of political and military figures.</p>

          <p>David Warburton, a former Conservative MP who represented the Somerton and Frome constituency in Somerset until 2023, has died suddenly at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious. Warburton was suspended from the party in 2022 over allegations of sexual misconduct, which were later withdrawn, but he resigned his seat in 2023 after admitting to cocaine use. His death has prompted tributes from former colleagues who remembered his passion for his constituents.</p>

          <p>A recent trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under threat after the Trump administration warned of new tariffs targeting Europe. The potential duties are a response to the EU's digital services taxes and technology regulations, such as the Digital Services Act (DSA), which Washington claims unfairly target American tech giants like Google and Amazon. This move has caught EU policymakers by surprise and reignited disputes over digital taxation and market regulation, putting significant pressure on transatlantic trade relations.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority when using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify imposing sweeping tariffs on most foreign countries. The court found that declaring longstanding trade deficits a "national emergency" went beyond the power granted to the president by the 1977 law. While the ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's trade policy, it does not immediately strike down the tariffs, allowing time for an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Developed by Israeli figures, the plan would be financed through private and public sector investment rather than federal funding, but raises significant questions about international law and Palestinian self-determination.</p>

          <p>An 85-year-old hiker has died in the Austrian Alps after being trampled by a herd of cows. The man and his 82-year-old wife were walking their dog near a mountain hut in Ramsau am Dachstein when a herd of nine cows, including three calves, charged them. Both were severely injured and airlifted to a hospital, where the man succumbed to his injuries. Fatal cow attacks are rare, but this incident has prompted local prosecutors to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragic event.</p>

          <p>The E3 group—Germany, France, and the United Kingdom—has triggered the "snapback" mechanism of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA). This move starts a 30-day countdown that could lead to the reimposition of all previously lifted UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. The action was taken in response to what the E3 considers Iran's non-compliance with the deal's terms. This escalation places Iran in a difficult diplomatic position, facing renewed international pressure while hardliners in Tehran advocate for withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Taipei, Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, described Taiwan as a "free country" with the "right to remain free." This strong statement of support for the island's self-determination was made alongside Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te and comes amid growing military pressure from China. Beijing, which considers Taiwan part of its territory, firmly condemned the visit and the remarks, calling them a violation of the one-China principle and an undermining of its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>President Trump is defending his administration's decision to issue 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals, a move that has drawn criticism from some of his staunchest supporters. He argued that banning Chinese students would be "insulting" to China and that their presence benefits the U.S. economy and smaller universities. This position marks a reversal from his administration's previous hardline stance and is seen by some as a gesture to improve relations with Beijing amid ongoing trade discussions, though it has caused confusion and anger within his MAGA base.</p>

The announcement from the security-focused summit sends a unified message implicitly critical of the United States, as the bloc acknowledges that escalating geopolitical tensions pose a growing threat.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious plan for the country to become a fully cashless society by 2030, with all financial transactions becoming digital. However, the article details significant challenges that make this goal appear unrealistic to experts. These hurdles include a large informal economy, particularly in agriculture, a population that overwhelmingly prefers cash, and a lack of robust cybersecurity infrastructure, which was exposed by major government cyberattacks in 2024. Critics argue the plan is dangerous without first addressing these fundamental weaknesses.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena for former FBI Director Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. A committee aide stated the decision was made after learning that Mueller has health issues that prevent him from appearing. Reports indicate that the 81-year-old former special counsel was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021. The committee had sought his testimony because he was the director of the FBI during the time Epstein was under federal investigation.</p>

This celestial event occurs when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's magnetic field, offering a rare opportunity for many to witness the colorful phenomenon.</p>
