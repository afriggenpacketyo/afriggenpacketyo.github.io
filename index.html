          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once considered a top quarterback prospect, went undrafted through the first three rounds of the 2025 NFL Draft. Despite the setback, the former Colorado Buffaloes quarterback remains positive, posting on X about another opportunity to play the game he loves and thanking God. Several other quarterbacks were selected ahead of Sanders, including Jaxson Dart, Tyler Shough, Jalen Milroe, and Dillon Gabriel. Sanders and Cam Ward were previously viewed as the draft's top passing prospects. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's actions during his presidency are reportedly benefiting Vladimir Putin, from pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to hinting at sanctions relief and absolving Russia of blame for the invasion. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine involves Russia keeping seized regions and preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Critics suggest that Trump's actions, including creating rifts with traditional allies and altering the U.S. government, serve Moscow's interests, whether intentionally or not.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, has expressed growing concerns about the rapid development of AI and its potential risks to humanity.

He criticizes AI companies for prioritizing profits over safety and believes they should dedicate more resources to safety research.

Giuffre was one of Epstein's most prominent accusers, revealing the trafficking and sexual exploitation of young women. The photo of her and Prince Andrew, taken in London in 2001, became emblematic of the royal's entanglement with Epstein.</p>

The recent redesignation of the Houthi rebels as a terrorist organization by the U.S. could further complicate coffee imports and impact the livelihoods of Yemeni farmers.
