          <p>A major fire and multiple explosions have occurred at a fireworks facility in Yolo County, California, leaving seven individuals unaccounted for. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics prompted mandatory evacuations for a one-mile radius as the blaze spread to nearby grass, burning approximately 80 acres. The company has issued a statement expressing condolences while officials investigate the cause of the incident, which injured two people and caused significant local disruption. The scene remains active with ongoing small explosions from undetonated fireworks, complicating the search for the missing.</p>

          <p>A large forest fire on the Greek island of Crete has led to the evacuation of four settlements, including the popular resort of Achlia.

While some individuals received treatment for breathing difficulties, no serious injuries have been reported thus far. Water-dropping aircraft were grounded overnight, complicating efforts by more than 150 firefighters to contain the fire amid a broader European heatwave.</p>

          <p>A significant legislative package championed by President Donald Trump, which includes major tax cuts and spending increases, has been halted in the House of Representatives due to opposition from a small group of Republican holdouts. The bill, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes making the 2017 tax cuts permanent while also cutting $1.2 trillion from Medicaid, a move the CBO estimates would cause 12 million people to lose health insurance. Despite pressure from the White House, defectors concerned about deficit spending have prevented the bill from moving forward to a final vote. (not investment advice)</p>

Starmer took responsibility for the flawed process, acknowledging the deep concern within his party on the issue, but insisted he remains committed to reforming the welfare system.

The gangs are creating parallel governance structures and paralyzing commerce, causing prices for essential goods to soar.

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that he has cemented his status as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had a period of unparalleled dominance, Kershaw's longevity and sustained excellence over 18 seasons give him the edge. The piece highlights Kershaw's superior numbers in several career categories and his role as the foundational leader of the current successful era of Dodgers baseball. It acknowledges his postseason struggles but frames them within the context of far more opportunities than Koufax had.</p>

          <p>Armenia is looking to elevate its relationship with China to a strategic partnership as it diversifies its foreign policy beyond its traditional reliance on Russia. In an interview, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated that both nations are ready to deepen ties without limitations. This diplomatic effort comes after Armenia grew disillusioned with Russia's failure to intervene in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent conflicts with Azerbaijan. Unlike its neighbors Georgia and Azerbaijan, Armenia has not yet established a formal strategic partnership with Beijing but sees a mutual interest in doing so.</p>

          <p>A federal jury acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking but found him guilty on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution. Combs, who will remain in detention pending sentencing, reacted with visible relief and emotion in the courtroom as he was cleared of the severe charges involving his former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura. Each of the two guilty counts carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The verdict followed a seven-week trial that included graphic testimony about his conduct and lifestyle.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. House of Representatives operating with a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become more prominent. This article explains that, according to House rules, if a vote on a question results in a tie, the measure is considered lost and fails to pass. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This procedural reality was highlighted in a February 2024 vote and is relevant again as leadership navigates potential defections on key bills.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic surge in the first half of 2025, with new listing volumes jumping to $14 billion, an eightfold increase from the previous year. This boom, the strongest since 2021, positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. The revival is driven by several factors, including regulatory support from Beijing for mainland companies to list in Hong Kong, a slower pace of listings in mainland China, and ample market liquidity. High-profile listings from companies like battery maker CATL have fueled the frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>
