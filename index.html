        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI has identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the primary suspect in the fatal car bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs. Bartkus, believed to have died in the explosion, reportedly held nihilistic views and targeted the in vitro fertilization facility in what authorities are treating as an intentional act of terrorism. The explosion injured four others and caused extensive damage to surrounding buildings, though all embryos at the clinic were safely recovered. Investigators are examining Bartkus' writings and social media activity, including a potential attempt to livestream the bombing, to understand his motives and complete his movements leading up to the attack. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering Trump v CASA, a case that could redefine birthright citizenship as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The case challenges the long-standing interpretation that grants automatic citizenship to almost everyone born on American soil, with exceptions for children of diplomats and invading armies. Donald Trump's executive order claims the 14th Amendment was never intended to apply to children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa-holders, prompting the Supreme Court to consider the limits of judicial power and the scope of American citizenship. The court's decision could have significant implications for immigration and citizenship laws in the United States. </p>

          <p>Police have been granted additional time to question a man arrested in connection with alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The 26-year-old was apprehended at London Luton Airport on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. The arrest relates to three incidents, including a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address where he previously lived in north-west London. A warrant of further detention was obtained at Westminster Magistrates' Court, allowing the man to be detained for an additional 36 hours. </p>

          <p>US authorities have identified a 25-year-old male as the suspect and the only fatality in Saturday's explosion at a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The FBI characterized the explosion as an "act of terrorism," and said they were "fairly confident" that the suspect was the man who died in the explosion. The suspect, a resident of Twentynine Palms, reportedly posted a manifesto online and tried to record the explosion. Local police chief Andy Mills said Palm Springs would be "stronger and more resilient as a result" of the attack, which he said had failed. </p>

The 40-year-old Briton said he savored the experience of racing in Italy for the first time as a Ferrari driver.

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer José Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball’s drug-testing program. The positive test was attributed to a weight loss drug Alvarado took during the offseason, and he accepted the suspension without appeal. Alvarado will lose a significant portion of his salary and will be ineligible for the postseason, impacting the Phillies' bullpen options. The team will need to find alternative closing options during his absence, while Alvarado focuses on addressing the situation and returning to the team. </p>

          <p>Dermatologists caution against leaving razors in the shower due to the moist environment fostering bacteria growth and causing rust, which can lead to skin irritation and infections. Instead, they recommend rinsing and drying razors thoroughly after use, storing them in a dry place outside the bathroom. Regular replacement of blades every five to seven shaves is also advised to prevent skin issues. Applying after-shave lotion and a gentle moisturizer after drying off is a good idea. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers released veteran Chris Taylor to make room for Tommy Edman's return, marking the end of Taylor's tenure with the team. Taylor's declining performance and the emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim led to the decision, as the Dodgers prioritize younger, more productive players. The move signifies a shift in the team's roster and a departure from familiar faces from their 2020 and 2024 World Series-winning teams. Taylor, once a key player for the Dodgers, struggled to regain his form after elbow surgery. </p>

          <p>A measles outbreak in Texas has fueled a push by "medical freedom" activists to make vaccinations voluntary, gaining support from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. These activists, who have long advocated for vaccine choice, have seen a wave of new allies elected to the Texas Legislature and are encouraged by Kennedy's stance. While vaccine-related bills are advancing in Texas, public health experts express concern that the activism is eroding vaccine confidence, leading to lower vaccination rates and increased outbreaks. The debate reflects a broader national trend of partisan division over vaccination, as anti-vaccine sentiment gains traction in Republican-led states. </p>

Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 273 drones, with 88 drones intercepted and another 128 went astray "without negative consequences".

          <p>President Trump's recent actions in the Middle East, including engaging with Syria's new leader and pursuing deals with Gulf nations, signal a shift in US foreign policy that sidelines Israel. This move breaks from decades of tradition where Israel held a central position in American diplomacy in the region. While the US maintains its historic ties with Israel, Trump's focus on negotiating peace deals with Iran and Yemen, coupled with his absence of a stop in Israel during his Middle East tour, highlights a new dynamic. Experts suggest this shift is driven by Trump's interest in the Gulf States' wealth and a perceived stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p>
