          <p>Reports indicate that 31 people were killed and over 150 injured due to Israeli gunfire near an aid distribution center in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health authorities and medics. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that an initial inquiry suggests their forces did not fire at Gazans near or within aid points, blaming Hamas for undermining food distribution efforts. Doctors at Nasser hospital reported receiving around 200 people with bullet or shrapnel injuries, while the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) denied any incident occurred near its distribution centers. The events highlight the severe humanitarian conditions in Rafah due to recent Israeli military operations which have restricted access to aid. Optimism is diminished due to the tragic loss of life and conflicting reports surrounding the incident.</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a large-scale drone attack targeting airfields in five Russian regions, as reported by the Russian Defense Ministry, which confirmed that several aircraft caught fire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the attacks "will be in the history books," while an SBU source told ABC News that the operation was planned for over a year and a half. The attacks utilized drones concealed in makeshift 'mobile houses' with retractable roofs. This operation occurs as Russia-Ukraine peace talks are scheduled to resume in Istanbul, Turkey, and the attack demonstrates a significant escalation in Ukraine's capabilities to strike deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>The presidential runoff election in Poland between liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki is too close to call, according to exit polls. An Ipsos exit poll predicted Trzaskowski winning with 50.3% of the vote, while Nawrocki received 49.7%. Trzaskowski has claimed victory in the second round of the election, with voter turnout appearing high, as at least 54.91% of eligible voters cast their ballots by late Sunday afternoon. The close results indicate a deeply divided electorate and a tense political climate in Poland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, including many of President Donald Trump's priorities, and now policy experts anticipate Senate changes as GOP lawmakers aim to finalize the "big bill" by the Fourth of July. If enacted as drafted, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and add new tax breaks, while also approving significant spending cuts to programs for low-income families. Policy experts expect considerable debate in the Senate, particularly regarding the Medicaid provision, though the overall bill is not expected to differ greatly. The outcome of these negotiations will significantly impact fiscal policy and social welfare programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the Trump administration's tariff policies, stating that while some companies have announced price hikes, others like Home Depot and Amazon will not pass costs to consumers. President Trump doubled the tariff on foreign steel to 50% and accused China of violating a trade agreement by withholding critical exports. Bessent emphasized that the administration aims to "de-risk" from China, not decouple, citing national and economic security concerns, however retailers like Walmart and Best Buy warn that high tariffs could raise prices. Bessent argues that companies often present worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to mitigate legal risks, highlighting the administration's commitment to its trade stance.</p>

          <p>Advisers to President Trump are defending his tariff policies amid legal challenges, insisting that they will remain in place despite a federal court ruling that Trump overstepped his authority. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that "tariffs are not going away," while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would back Trump's tariffs. The administration swiftly appealed the ruling, and a federal appeals court granted their request for a temporary stay, arguing that overturning the tariffs would undermine Trump's negotiating leverage with other nations. The legal battle adds uncertainty to Trump's tariff plan, which has already impacted the global economy.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs have ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. The edict came after the New England Journal of Medicine published an article co-authored by two VA pulmonologists warning that staff reductions jeopardize veterans' health. VA workers and veterans advocates say the warnings fit a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration, which critics say is waging a "war on science". The policy is seen as an attack on freedom of speech that could harm veterans and research programs.</p>

David, now a domestic abuse campaigner, has written a book, called The Unthinkable, about the family's experiences, and said more needs to be done to protect victims. A law passed in 2015, which recognizes psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, helped secure Mrs Challen's release from prison after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011. David said the description of coercive control had set him and his mother "free".</p>
