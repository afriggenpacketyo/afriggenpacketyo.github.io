          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made a surprising, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a move that significantly exceeds its own valuation. The offer is reportedly backed by several investors and comes as Perplexity expands its presence with its own AI-powered browser, Comet. This bid occurs in the context of a recent antitrust ruling against Google, where the U.S. Department of Justice proposed that Google divest Chrome to level the competitive landscape in the internet search market. The potential acquisition highlights the escalating competition and high-stakes investment in the generative AI sector.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have reportedly instructed companies to avoid using specific Nvidia and AMD artificial intelligence chips, particularly for government and national security purposes. This guidance follows an agreement where both U.S. chipmakers would give 15% of their China-related revenue to the U.S. government, a development stemming from ongoing national security concerns. The situation underscores the escalating tech tensions between the U.S. and China, creating uncertainty for chipmakers who view China as a critical market. Former President Trump also commented on the issue, labeling Nvidia's H20 chip as "obsolete." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in New Delhi detained dozens of animal rights activists protesting a Supreme Court order to remove thousands of stray dogs from the city's streets. The court's decision, which mandates capturing and relocating 5,000 dogs to shelters, was prompted by reports of nearly 2,000 daily dog bites in the capital. Protesters argue that the government should instead focus on enforcing existing animal birth control rules, which involve sterilization and vaccination. They claim the current plan is inhumane and will not effectively solve the underlying issue of the city's large stray dog population.</p>

Guo, who was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents for charity, landed on King George Island with what authorities called "false flight plan data." As part of the agreement to avoid trial, he must make a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and is banned from Chile for three years.

The milestone was reached after 474 people arrived on Monday, a day which also saw a woman die while attempting the journey from France. The figures have intensified political debate, with the Conservative opposition criticizing Labour's approach as ineffective. The government maintains it is implementing measures to combat people-smuggling gangs, including a new returns deal with France, though the issue remains a significant political challenge.</p>

          <p>The cast of the upcoming 'The Real Housewives of London' has revealed that the on-screen conflicts were so intense that producers occasionally had to intervene and ask them to tone it down. The six cast members, who were not close friends before filming, include a mix of socialites and businesswomen, promising a high level of drama for the UK-based edition of the popular global franchise. Despite the friction, the women state they formed closer bonds during the filming process. The new series, which joins over 30 international versions of the show, is set to premiere on Hayu later this month.</p>

The 29-year-old stated that conversations with manager David Moyes were key to his decision, expressing excitement to join the club and repay the support from fans. Grealish, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, fell out of favor last season and hopes the move will help him rejuvenate his career and regain his spot in the England national squad.

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has issued a warning about its ability to continue operations, citing "substantial doubt" about its future as a going concern. In a quarterly report, the company pointed to persistent adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and rising operational costs. Despite emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March and implementing cost-cutting measures like pilot furloughs, Spirit stated it needs to secure more liquidity to survive.

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.7% annually in July, a figure slightly below economists' expectations and consistent with the previous month's rate. On a monthly basis, inflation increased by 0.2%, with rising food costs being a notable factor. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed to a five-month high of 3.1% year-over-year. While inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts believe the steady overall rate keeps the possibility of a September interest rate cut on the table, especially with recent signs of a slowing job market.

Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose to 3.1%, its fastest pace since February. Analysts suggest that the full impact of these tariffs on consumer prices for items like household furnishings and apparel may become more pronounced in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the UK's tax agency, has confirmed it is using artificial intelligence to monitor the social media accounts of individuals suspected of tax evasion. The agency stated the technology is used to support criminal investigations and will not replace human decision-making, aiming to free up staff for more complex tasks. While government investigators have long examined social media posts, the use of AI automates part of the process. Experts have raised concerns about potential risks, such as mistaken identity, emphasizing the continued need for human oversight in such surveillance.</p>

          <p>The Philippine military has blamed China for a collision between a Chinese navy ship and a Chinese coast guard vessel during a confrontation in the South China Sea. The incident occurred as the Chinese ships were attempting to block a Philippine patrol vessel from accessing the disputed Scarborough Shoal. Philippine military officials stated the Chinese navy ship maneuvered aggressively, causing it to crash into its own coast guard ship, resulting in heavy damage to both Chinese vessels. The Philippines condemned the use of military force against civilians, calling it a symbol of China's escalating aggression in the region.</p>

Despite this, CEO Tarang Amin remains focused on the company's long-term growth, citing 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and its popularity among younger consumers. The Rhode deal, financed partly by debt, will expand E.l.f.'s presence into Sephora stores and is seen by analysts as a potentially accretive move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Guardian opinion article argues that President Trump's decision to take control of Washington D.C.'s municipal police and deploy the National Guard is a dangerous exercise of authoritarian power. The author contends that the stated pretext of rising crime is false, as crime rates have actually fallen, and that the move is intended to punish a politically opposed city. The article frames the action not as a response to a crisis, but as a message that the president will impose his will by force on any entity that is not deferential. It suggests this erodes democratic norms and represents a collapse of rhetoric and reality.</p>

The six key factors identified are innovation, direct management, organizational effectiveness, engagement, emotional connection, and alignment with the company's mission.

          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on the best placement for their cash as the interest rate environment begins to shift. While both money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts offer elevated returns, they have key differences. Money market accounts often provide check-writing and debit card access but may require higher minimum balances to earn top rates. High-yield savings accounts typically have lower entry barriers and are ideal for emergency funds or short-term goals. With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, the choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity, fees, and overall savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the income, financial experts suggest several smart strategies. One option is to reinvest the funds in a taxable brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like ETFs. Another popular strategy is the qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer from an IRA to a charity, satisfying the RMD. For those focused on legacy planning, contributing the RMD proceeds to a 529 college savings plan for family members can provide a state tax benefit while supporting future generations.

Masra, who briefly served in a transitional government before challenging Deby in the recent election, denies the charges.

          <p>An analysis by NPR's Planet Money explores the hidden societal costs that result from federal cuts to Medicaid, which are projected to leave 10 million Americans uninsured by 2034. While lawmakers justify the cuts as a cost-saving measure, the financial burden shifts to other parts of the system. Hospitals, particularly non-profits, act as "insurers of last resort," absorbing billions in uncompensated care. Community health centers face financial strain, and individuals without insurance are at high risk of crippling medical debt and bankruptcy. Ultimately, a sicker, less insured populace leads to lower economic productivity, with costs cycling back to society.</p>
