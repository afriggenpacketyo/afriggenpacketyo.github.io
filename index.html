          <p>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is pushing to launch its single currency, the ECO, by 2027, aiming to foster regional trade and economic integration. This ambitious plan, originally conceived for 2020, has encountered significant obstacles including economic disparities among member states, political disagreements, and the departure of three nations from the bloc. Experts highlight the critical need for shared political understanding and centralized monetary policy for the ECO's viability, suggesting larger economies like Nigeria and Ghana could spearhead the initial rollout. Success could bolster ECOWAS's influence in global finance and attract foreign investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mysterious glowing, pill-shaped object spotted over upstate New York sparked widespread UFO speculation and social media frenzy. Residents described the slow-moving orb as "otherworldly," fueling alien visitation theories. However, the phenomenon was later confirmed to be the planned launch of the Vulcan Centaur rocket by the United Launch Alliance from Cape Canaveral, Florida. A retired Rear Admiral emphasized the importance of data verification to distinguish between misidentifications and genuine Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), advocating for more scientific transparency to reduce stigma and fear surrounding such sightings.</p>

          <p>Two years into the generative AI boom, Nvidia faces high expectations as its revenue and profits have surged, making it a $4 trillion market cap company. The chipmaker's upcoming second-quarter earnings report will highlight its shift from gaming to a central role in AI technology, with data center revenue now dominating sales. Despite substantial growth, the pace has slowed, and the company grapples with regaining access to the Chinese market for its H20 chip, which now requires a U.S. government license and a 15% revenue share. Analysts closely watch Blackwell chip performance and China sales for market indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>America has transformed into a nation of exercise enthusiasts, a stark contrast to the post-WWII era when physical activity was discouraged, especially for women due to outdated beliefs. Journalist Danielle Friedman highlights how fitness evangelists on TV in the 1950s and 60s, alongside President JFK's call for a "physically fit" nation, began shifting perceptions. The 1970s marked a turning point with the women's movement, Title IX, and the birth of exercise science, popularizing activities like running, aerobic dancing, and yoga. Celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jane Fonda further cemented fitness as aspirational, commercializing workouts and shaping a uniquely American culture of continuous physical striving.</p>

          <p>China Evergrande Group, once a leading developer, has been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking an ignominious end to its $51 billion market cap and symbolizing China's property bust. With over $300 billion in debt, Evergrande's default triggered a sector-wide crisis that continues to weigh on China's economic growth, with new home prices falling. While analysts anticipate the drag to ease, a "flight to safety" favors state-backed developers, suggesting inevitable industry consolidation. The slow liquidation process leaves hundreds of thousands of homebuyers and creditors facing uncertain prospects, highlighting the limited recourse for overseas investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northern Lights, a consortium led by Equinor, Shell, and TotalEnergies, has initiated the world's first commercial carbon storage service, injecting CO2 deep under the North Sea seabed off Norway's coast. This project aims to capture and bury industrial emissions, preventing their release and aiding climate change mitigation. While carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized by climate bodies, it remains complex, controversial, and costly, with critics questioning its efficacy and motives, arguing for a stronger focus on transitioning to clean energy sources. The facility's initial capacity is 1.7 million tons annually, with plans to expand.</p>

          <p>Delays in student loan forgiveness, stemming from administrative backlogs and recent court actions, could result in "massive" tax bills for borrowers. A federal law shielding loan forgiveness from taxation expires at the end of 2025, meaning debt cancelled afterward may become taxable income. With over 1.3 million applications pending for income-driven repayment plans, advocates warn of significant financial burdens, potentially exceeding $12,000 for average balances in higher tax brackets. Lawmakers are urging swift action from the Education Department to prevent these penalties, while borrowers are advised to save payment records and plan for potential future tax liabilities.

Studies from Australia, which implemented a country-wide ban, show reduced distractions, improved learning, and decreased behavioral problems. While teachers struggle with phone use for school-related tasks, the inherent dopamine-driven urge to check devices makes "just say no" policies ineffective, highlighting the need for comprehensive restrictions to foster genuine in-person interaction and resilience.</p>

          <p>China has reiterated its claim over the Spratly Islands, stating they are "inherent territory," and expressed firm opposition to Vietnam's expanded construction activities on illegally occupied reefs. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun warned that Beijing would take necessary measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights. This response follows a report indicating that Vietnam has expanded its island-building efforts to eight previously untouched features since the beginning of the year, intensifying tensions in the South China Sea. The ongoing territorial disputes remain a flashpoint in regional international relations.</p>

          <p>China burned more coal in the first seven months of 2025 than at any time since 2016, according to a new environmental report, despite paradoxically installing enormous amounts of renewable energy capacity. The report highlights 21 gigawatts of new coal power brought online and significant proposed projects, threatening China's climate goals. While China is massively expanding solar and wind power, which now covers electricity demand growth, "powerful coal interests" are crowding out renewables through long-term contracts. This leaves emissions on a high plateau, challenging President Xi Jinping's pledge to strictly control and phase down the coal industry.</p>

Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies.

          <p>Challenging the perception of fish as "simple-minded animals," new research suggests they may feel pleasure and actively seek it. Neuroscientists Caio Maximino and Marta Soares studied bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, observing that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been "cleaned." Experiments with opioid mimics increased this preference, while opioid blockers diminished it, indicating pleasure mediated by natural brain opioids. Further tests distinguished between "liking" and "wanting," suggesting a dopamine-driven desire. These findings could prompt a rethinking of how fish are treated in aquariums and aquaculture, highlighting a more complex emotional life in aquatic species.</p>
