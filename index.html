          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and asserting his constitutional authority. Cook, however, vehemently denies these accusations and, through her legal counsel, has declared her intention to file a lawsuit challenging what she views as an unlawful dismissal, vowing to remain in her post. This unprecedented action intensifies Trump's public pressure on the US central bank, which he has criticized for its interest rate policies, sparking widespread debate among economists and legal experts regarding the Federal Reserve's essential independence. The impending legal battle is set to test the limits of presidential power over a body traditionally insulated from political interference, potentially impacting global financial markets and the stability of the US economy.</p>

          <p>A devastating double Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, tragically killed 20 individuals, including multiple journalists and health workers. The initial blast was swiftly followed by a second, occurring minutes later as responders and media gathered, a controversial military tactic. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret and initiated an investigation, the IDF later claimed it targeted a Hamas camera and that some fatalities were "terrorists," a claim human rights groups dispute. This incident has provoked widespread international outrage and calls for an independent inquiry, highlighting the extreme dangers faced by non-combatants and media professionals in the conflict zone, and intensifying pressure on all parties to respect international law.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel, including a significant "day of disruption" in Tel Aviv, have taken to the streets demanding the immediate release of remaining hostages and an end to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Demonstrators blocked major highways and set tires ablaze, signaling a rising tide of public discontent. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum spearheaded the "Israel stands together" day of action, with families imploring their leaders to secure a negotiation deal. Activists also called for the government to reconsider its plans to take over Gaza City, underscoring deep societal divisions regarding the war's trajectory and the urgent fate of the 50 remaining captives, of whom only 20 are believed to be alive.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the expulsion of Iranian Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi and three other embassy employees, citing their confirmed involvement in antisemitic crimes. Australia's Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) investigations revealed that Iran had coordinated these attacks within Australia. In a further diplomatic escalation to counter this hostile behavior, the Australian government will also close its embassy in Tehran. This decisive action underscores Australia's firm stance against foreign interference and its commitment to safeguarding national security and community harmony, although the Prime Minister noted not all antisemitic incidents in the country could be attributed to Iran.</p>

The proposed deal includes an initial 60-day truce and a phased exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent directive for talks aimed at securing all hostages and ending the war on Israel's terms, the mediators await a concrete and serious commitment from Israel to move forward.</p>

          <p>Over 200 former EU and member state diplomats have signed an open letter, urgently calling for the European Union to implement immediate measures against Israel due to its "unlawful actions in Gaza and the West Bank." The letter proposes nine specific actions, including the unilateral suspension of arms export licenses, cessation of funding for projects involving Israeli entities, and enforcement of human rights sanctions such as visa bans and asset freezes. Expressing " profound disappointment" with the EU's perceived inaction, the diplomats highlight the lack of a ceasefire, the continued obstruction of humanitarian aid, and the escalating Palestinian casualties, emphasizing the need for the EU to exert greater pressure on Israel.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military's preliminary inquiry into the Nasser Hospital strikes in Gaza suggests soldiers targeted a Hamas camera used to observe IDF activities, claiming six of the deceased were "terrorists" while expressing regret for civilian harm. This justification comes amidst intense international condemnation of the "double-tap" attacks that killed journalists and aid workers. Human rights organizations, however, accuse Israel of disseminating disinformation to rationalize civilian casualties, noting a monitoring group's report indicating 88% of alleged war crimes cases remain unresolved. The incident exacerbates the contentious debate surrounding military transparency and adherence to international law in the ongoing conflict, with many demanding impartial investigations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook directly challenges a rare limit on presidential power established by the Supreme Court in Trump v. Wilcox, which indicated Fed leaders are protected from arbitrary firing. While the Court generally supports the "unitary executive" theory, it carved out an exception for the Fed due to its crucial role in monetary policy and economic stability. Trump alleges mortgage fraud as "cause," but critics view this as a pretext to install a more politically favorable official. The impending legal battle will test the Republican-majority Court's commitment to this precedent, with significant implications for the Fed's independence and the US economy.</p>

The White House's official X account amplified this sentiment with a "Go woke, go broke" tweet featuring a Trump-themed Cracker Barrel logo.

          <p>Reform UK has unveiled a radical migration plan, "Operation Restoring Justice," aiming to deport 500,000-600,000 migrants over five years if elected. Leader Nigel Farage stated the party would bar asylum claims from small boat arrivals, detaining them in disused RAF bases, and offering £2 billion in payments or aid to countries like Afghanistan for repatriations. The plan includes building new removal centers and "disapplying" international treaties like the Refugee Convention and the ECHR.

          <p>President Donald Trump's escalating conflict with the Federal Reserve, particularly his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, is raising serious questions about the central bank's independence and its potential impact on the US economy.

Historical examples, like President Nixon's influence on Fed Chair Arthur Burns, illustrate the risks. Global investors rely on the Fed's credibility, and any erosion could increase US borrowing costs, with worldwide repercussions.</p>

This change, coinciding with the airline's shift to assigned seating, has drawn criticism from travel advocates who argue it will worsen the flying experience for all passengers and further erode customer loyalty.

          <p>Mortgage interest rates, currently around 6.58% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are expected to see modest drops by late fall 2025, according to experts. While the Federal Reserve may cut the federal funds rate in September, mortgage rates, which follow the bond market, might not immediately mirror this. Analysts project rates could trend towards 6% by year-end, a "psychological barrier" that could significantly increase homebuyer demand. This potential influx of buyers could, however, push home prices up, creating a "double-edged sword" for prospective homeowners. Borrowers are advised to shop around and maintain good credit to navigate the evolving market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) highly effective "Tips From Former Smokers" ad campaign is set to end in September due to funding cuts and a reorganization of the CDC's chronic disease programs under the Trump administration. For 13 years, these ads linked real-life stories of smoking harm with free quitline help, leading to millions of quit attempts and over a million long-term quits, saving billions in healthcare costs. Public health advocates and former smokers fear the cessation of this campaign will cost lives and increase healthcare spending, dismantling decades of tobacco control progress and leaving states without crucial support.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Trump Pentagon is "thinking about" acquiring equity stakes in leading defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin. This consideration follows the US government's recent $9 billion acquisition of 10% of Intel stock.

Critics, including some conservatives, warn that such moves could politicize corporate decisions and run counter to free-market principles, raising concerns about a shift towards greater government control over the private economy.</p>

While completely turning off the AC for several hours can save money, it poses a risk of mold in humid environments and can increase wear and tear on the system when it has to work harder to rapidly recool. The optimal approach varies based on climate, home insulation, and the type of AC unit. Simple, "time-honored strategies" like blocking sunlight and opening windows at night can also significantly contribute to keeping homes cool and managing rising electricity costs.</p>

          <p>US companies are aggressively frontloading Chinese imports as a strategy to circumvent the escalating tariffs in President Trump's renewed trade war with China, importing more than double the percentage of Chinese exports compared to the 2018 trade war. Data reveals three significant frontloading events in 2025, culminating in a peak during June-July following a reduction in tariff rates. Despite this initial surge, indicators like declining ocean freight bookings and spot rates suggest a forthcoming drop in Chinese exports. This tactic, while temporarily cushioning the impact of tariffs, points to a potential contraction in imports over the next few months as previously pulled-forward demand wanes.</p>

This seasonal outlook, covering September through November, suggests milder conditions overall, though it doesn't predict daily extremes. Warmer falls, a trend observed since the early 1900s, can prolong summer-like heat, increase cooling costs, extend allergy and wildfire seasons, and negatively impact fall foliage vibrancy. The forecast attributes this to climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean, particularly an expected shift towards a cooler La Niña pattern by November.</p>

While some nations, particularly in the Sahel, still rank low on the Human Development Index due to factors like infertile land, limited resources, high birthrates, and political instability, overall progress is evident. Over the past 65 years, extreme poverty has declined, life expectancy has risen, and infant mortality has fallen across most of these countries. Despite waning French political influence, close economic ties, including the CFA franc currency system, endure, and remittances from the diaspora significantly contribute to development.</p>
