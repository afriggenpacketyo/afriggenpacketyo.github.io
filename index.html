          <p>Former US President Donald Trump announced he has spoken with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, stating both nations are seeking an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly border clashes. Trump indicated that peace talks were a natural path forward and linked future trade agreements to the cessation of hostilities. The conflict, which has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 130,000 people, stems from a long-standing border dispute centered on the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Officials from the two countries have not yet confirmed the talks mentioned by Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Weather Service has issued widespread heat alerts affecting over 136 million people across the U.S. Midwest and Southeast, with temperatures expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above average. A persistent high-pressure system, known as a heat dome, is trapping hot air over the regions, leading to dangerously high heat indexes reaching up to 115°F. Officials are urging residents to take precautions, such as staying hydrated and avoiding sun exposure, to prevent heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke. The extreme conditions are forecast to persist through the coming week with minimal overnight relief.</p>

          <h2>Dozens of Palestinians Killed in Gaza Amidst Stalled Ceasefire Talks and Famine Warnings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:34:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 42 Palestinians were killed by Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, including a dozen people waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. The violence occurs as ceasefire negotiations have stalled and the United Nations warns of a deepening famine, with a rising number of deaths from malnutrition-related causes, particularly among children. International pressure on Israel is increasing to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, with countries like the UK and Jordan planning aid airdrops, though aid agencies warn these are insufficient. A UNICEF spokesperson highlighted that supplies for treating severely malnourished children are projected to run out by mid-August.</p>

          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the acclaimed 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, over two decades after the original's release. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape of women's football made it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the Women's World Cup, and hopes to reunite the original cast. The original film was a cultural hit, praised for inspiring a generation of female athletes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents found no evidence of systematic, widespread diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, according to a presentation reviewed by ABC News. This finding challenges repeated claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify limiting aid flow and supporting an alternative distribution system. The State Department and the Israel Defense Forces have forcefully pushed back against the report's conclusions, with the IDF stating it ignores evidence of Hamas exploiting aid. The analysis was compiled before USAID ceased independent operations on July 1.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a non-invasive wearable sensor designed to monitor a person's hydration levels in real time. The device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the arm to measure tissue hydration, and wirelessly transmits the data to a smartphone to alert users when they need water. Scientists say this technology could be a crucial tool in preventing dehydration-related health issues like heatstroke, particularly for athletes, outdoor workers, and individuals with certain medical conditions. The team hopes to make the technology widely accessible for public use.</p>

          <p>India demonstrated strong resistance on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England, closing at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After an early setback losing two wickets for no runs, captain Shubman Gill (78 not out) and KL Rahul (87 not out) forged an unbroken partnership of 174. Their performance blunted an England attack that was missing all-rounder Ben Stokes, who did not bowl. Earlier, Stokes had scored his 14th Test century, a knock of 141, to help England post a formidable total of 669, giving them a first-innings lead of 311.</p>

One victim's sister recounted the mayhem that led to her sister being shot in the head while trying to get food for her children.

          <p>In an analysis piece, BBC's Jeremy Bowen argues that airdropping aid into Gaza is a "crude process" and an act of desperation that will not solve the growing hunger crisis. Drawing on his experience covering past conflicts in Iraq and Bosnia, he describes airdrops as inefficient, dangerous, and a last resort, noting that Gaza is accessible by land through Israeli and Jordanian crossings. He points out that planes carry far less than truck convoys and that pallets can land inaccurately, sometimes causing harm to civilians or being seized by criminal elements. Only a ceasefire and unrestricted land access can truly address the starvation, he concludes.</p>

Meanwhile, Tadej Pogacar safely finished in the main peloton, all but guaranteeing his fourth overall Tour de France title. Barring any accidents on the final processional stage into Paris, the Slovenian cyclist will be crowned the champion. Groves' win marked a significant achievement, completing his trilogy of stage wins across all three of cycling's Grand Tours and giving his Alpecin-Deceuninck team its third victory in this year's race.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached new record highs this past week, buoyed by positive developments in international trade and strong corporate earnings. The market's upward momentum was partly fueled by President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with China and the EU. Economically, reports on home sales showed mixed price trends, a key factor for inflation. Major companies like GE Vernova and Danaher reported strong quarterly results, though Honeywell and Dover saw their stocks dip despite beating expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While recent studies link daily coffee consumption to health benefits, experts emphasize that the right amount varies for each individual and that moderation is crucial. The FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups, but some people may experience anxiety or jitters with less. Dietitians advise being mindful of how your body reacts, noting that caffeine can affect sleep and suppress appetite. For most healthy adults, two to three cups before noon is considered a safe range, but pregnant people and those with certain health conditions should be more cautious.</p>

          <p>Media executive Tom Rogers, a former self-proclaimed "raging bull" on Netflix, has expressed new concerns about the streaming giant's long-term growth. He pointed to a decline in viewing time per subscriber and rising competition from free content on platforms like YouTube, which now accounts for more monthly TV viewership than Netflix. Rogers believes artificial intelligence will be a "double-edged sword," helping Netflix with ad targeting but also empowering amateur creators on YouTube to produce professional-quality content. While still seeing Netflix as a market leader, he suggests this lag in user engagement is a worrisome trend to monitor.</p>

The study found that while not all products contained PFAS, some had levels high enough to indicate they were intentionally used in manufacturing.

The directive follows intense political pressure and speculation about Trump's connection to the late sex trafficker. However, legal experts and lawyers for Epstein's victims are skeptical that these transcripts will reveal the full scope of Epstein's crimes or implicate others. They argue that more crucial evidence, including FBI interview summaries and internal DOJ memos, exists within the complete Epstein files, which would provide a much clearer picture than the limited grand jury testimony.</p>
