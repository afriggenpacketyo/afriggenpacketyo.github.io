          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly terminated the employment of at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, these dismissals are part of a broader purge that has already seen most senior prosecutors from the probes ousted. The firings, which include support staff and U.S. marshals identified by a "weaponization working group," have reportedly created a climate of fear among career employees at the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Center Myles Turner has officially joined the Milwaukee Bucks on a four-year, $107 million deal, ending his ten-year tenure with the Indiana Pacers. In his introductory press conference, Turner attributed his departure to "alignment issues" with the Pacers, particularly after the team's future became uncertain following Tyrese Haliburton's Achilles injury. Turner acknowledged the difficulty of leaving the only NBA team he had ever known but expressed excitement about the new opportunity with the Bucks, a decision he made after discussions with his family and team leadership.</p>

          <p>Dr. Hong Wang, a prominent Chinese mathematician and a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has become a target for cyber-nationalists in China for delivering academic lectures in English. Despite being a graduate of Peking University, her international career, including a doctorate in the U.S. and a new professorship in France, has fueled online criticism. Her recent seminars at top Chinese universities were packed with attendees, highlighting her academic acclaim, yet the controversy underscores growing nationalist sentiments online regarding the use of foreign languages in academic settings.</p>

          <p>Talks are scheduled for next week between UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the British Medical Association (BMA) to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has stated the strike, set to begin on July 25, will only be cancelled if the government presents a credible new pay offer. The government has offered a 5.4% increase for the current year, but doctors argue this is insufficient to restore real-terms pay, which they claim has fallen by 20% since 2008. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions over pay and working conditions within the NHS.</p>

This growth is fueled by new commercial interests in space travel, manufacturing, and satellite constellations, moving beyond traditional state-led missions. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan aims to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by about 15% by closing or merging offices to eliminate redundancy and focus on core missions.

Key administration figures like Attorney General Pam Bondi have faced intense backlash from the base.

While proponents argue it tastes closer to the real thing than current plant-based options and is more sustainable, the industry faces challenges. These include high initial costs, regulatory approval processes, and a recent decline in consumer demand for vegan cheese alternatives.</p>

          <p>The family of Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Tampa, reports that he was beaten to death by settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank while visiting family. The incident allegedly occurred on Friday in the town of Sinjil as Musallet was protecting his family's land. His family claims that settlers surrounded him for hours, preventing medical aid from reaching him. The U.S. State Department has confirmed the death of a citizen and is providing consular assistance, while the family calls for a U.S.-led investigation into the killing.</p>

          <p>A major excavation has commenced at the site of a former church-run mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of 796 babies and young children. The St Mary's home, operated by the Bon Secours Sisters from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. The unmarked grave was uncovered by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, and a 2017 government investigation confirmed "significant quantities of human remains." The two-year excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a long-awaited and somber reckoning for survivors and families.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from conducting "indiscriminate" immigration arrests and denying individuals access to legal counsel. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong came in response to a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained without reasonable suspicion. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting claims of unconstitutional practices, such as arrests based solely on race or location. The order represents a legal setback for the administration's intensified immigration crackdown, particularly in California.</p>

          <p>As China faces a declining population, the role of artificial intelligence is becoming a subject of debate, with some blaming it for worsening the trend by reducing incentives for marriage and childbirth. AI is increasingly capable of providing emotional companionship and is expected to handle elderly care, roles traditionally filled by family. However, some experts argue this technological shift isn't entirely negative, suggesting that AI could redefine societal structures around life and family, potentially making traditional demographic concerns obsolete. This reflects a growing sentiment among some younger Chinese who prefer a single life supported by technology.</p>
