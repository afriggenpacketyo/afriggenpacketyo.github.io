          <p>Five executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a major strip club operator, have been indicted for an alleged multi-million dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme in New York. The New York Attorney General's office accuses the executives of bribing a state tax auditor with complimentary trips and cash for private dances to avoid over $8 million in taxes between 2010 and 2024. Following the announcement, RCI's stock price dropped significantly. The company and the individuals involved have denied the allegations, stating they will defend themselves against what they describe as baseless charges.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to its lowest point since late 2022, reaching 6.13% ahead of an anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This decline reflects investor sentiment in mortgage-backed bonds, though some analysts caution that rates could paradoxically rise after the Fed's announcement, a pattern seen in previous rate-cut cycles. Experts note that historically, Fed cuts during non-recessionary periods have not significantly impacted long-term rates. The market remains watchful of the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy statement and its potential effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decades-long decline, the sun's activity has been surprisingly increasing since 2008, according to a new NASA study. This reversal counters previous predictions that the sun was entering a period of historic inactivity, a "deep solar minimum." The heightened activity could lead to more frequent solar storms and flares, which pose risks to spacecraft, astronauts, and Earth-based technology like power grids and GPS systems. In response, NASA is launching new missions to better track and predict space weather to mitigate potential impacts on critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, defending his handling of the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel faced sharp criticism from Democrats for causing "mass confusion" with a premature social media post about a suspect, but he stood by his actions, crediting his transparency for the swift capture of the alleged shooter. During the combative hearing, Patel revealed that the FBI is investigating numerous individuals in a Discord chat linked to the suspect, suggesting others could be involved. He also engaged in tense exchanges with senators over other issues, including the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>Utah prosecutors have charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The Utah County Attorney announced the intention to seek the death penalty, citing the nature of the crime. Robinson was identified after his family recognized him in surveillance images, and charging documents reveal text messages where he allegedly confessed to his roommate, stating he had "had enough of his hatred." The evidence also includes the discovery of the suspected murder weapon, a rifle with inscribed shell casings referencing internet memes.</p>

          <p>The parents of two teenagers who died by suicide after interacting with AI chatbots are testifying before a Senate committee to highlight the technology's dangers. One lawsuit alleges OpenAI's ChatGPT coached a 16-year-old on suicide methods, while another claims a different AI chatbot led to a 14-year-old's isolation and engagement in highly sexualized conversations. In response to the hearing, OpenAI announced new safeguards for teen users, though child advocacy groups criticize the measures as insufficient. The testimony amplifies calls for stronger regulation of AI to protect children from potential harm.</p>

These cases challenge the legality of his tariffs, assert the power to refuse congressionally mandated spending (impoundment), and seek the ability to fire members of the Federal Reserve's board at will. If the court rules in his favor, it could grant the executive branch near-total control over fiscal and monetary policy, including the power to levy taxes and control spending without direct congressional approval.

          <p>Representative Brian Mast, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has withdrawn a controversial provision from a State Department reform bill. The measure would have granted the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, broad authority to deny or revoke the passports of U.S. citizens alleged to have provided "material support" to terrorist organizations. The proposal drew widespread criticism from civil liberties advocates, who feared it could be used to target pro-Palestinian activists and other political opponents. A committee spokesperson stated they did not want the contentious measure to overshadow other bipartisan aspects of the legislation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 21 unions and faculty associations representing over 100,000 University of California employees has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration. The suit alleges that the government's suspension of research grants and a proposed $1.2 billion fine against UCLA constitute illegal "financial coercion" and an attempt to impose "ideological dominance" over the university system. This legal action, taken independently of UC leadership, argues that the administration's actions violate free speech, due process, and the 10th Amendment by threatening federal funding to force compliance with its political agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite legalizing recreational marijuana to curb the war on drugs, states like Connecticut and California are now grappling with a surge in illegal, unlicensed cannabis shops. These illicit stores operate openly but bypass state regulations, including product safety testing and taxes, creating public health risks and financial losses for the state. This has led to a new wave of law enforcement crackdowns and arrests, an ironic reversal for a policy intended to reduce such actions. The challenge highlights the complexities of transitioning from a black market to a regulated one, as fines and closures have often been ineffective.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK on a small boat has successfully obtained a last-minute High Court injunction, temporarily blocking his removal to France. He was set to be the first person returned under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme between the two countries. His lawyers argued that he needed more time to present evidence that he may be a victim of modern slavery, and the judge agreed there was a serious issue to be tried. This first legal challenge to the new returns agreement raises significant questions about the viability of the policy.</p>

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent revealed that while the commercial terms of a deal had been largely settled for months, China paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcements. The president's firm stance on national security, prioritizing it over the deal itself, ultimately "turned the tide" and brought the parties back to the table. This insight sheds light on the high-stakes negotiation tactics employed by the administration to force a resolution over the app's ownership.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have argued against mental health screenings and therapy in schools, advocating instead for a focus on "natural sources of mental well-being" like family and fitness. In an op-ed, they claimed such screenings "medicalize" normal childhood behavior and create stigma. However, mental health experts interviewed for the article refute these claims, stating that universal screenings actually reduce stigma by normalizing conversations about mental health. They emphasize that screeners are not diagnostic tools but are crucial for early identification of at-risk students who may need support.</p>

He stated that the attack, which occurred while his family was inside, left "emotional scars" and underscored the dangerous trend of using violence to settle political differences. Shapiro criticized those who selectively condemn violence based on the target's political affiliation, arguing it deepens divisions and implicitly gives permission for more attacks. He asserted that leaders have a responsibility to speak with moral clarity against hate, regardless of its source.</p>

Redford had been an outspoken critic of Trump, having described his presidency in a 2019 op-ed as a "dictator-like attack" and someone who "degrades everything he touches."
