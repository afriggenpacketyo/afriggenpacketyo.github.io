          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and two injuries during what authorities described as a brief but violent event. The deceased victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare, who was dining with his family at the club's restaurant. Authorities quickly arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, a former employee of the club, and charged him with second-degree murder, with additional charges anticipated. Officials praised the courageous actions of patrons who intervened, including one who struck the shooter with a chair, likely preventing a more tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>The ABC10 television station building in Sacramento was struck by multiple rounds of gunfire in an apparent drive-by shooting, though no injuries were reported. The Sacramento Police Department arrested 64-year-old Anibal Hernandez-Santana on state charges, but after he was released on bail, the FBI took him back into custody on a federal charge of interfering with a radio communications station. The motive for the attack is still under investigation. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the act, stating that any violence toward journalists constitutes an attack on democracy itself.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people with terminal illnesses are creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final days, a practice with recognized therapeutic benefits. The article highlights the story of a former DJ curating the soundtrack of his life to help him and his family navigate his palliative care journey. Experts explain that music can access multiple brain regions simultaneously, reducing anxiety and creating shared experiences even when a person is unresponsive.

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region opened higher, following gains on Wall Street, as investors anticipated China's decision on its loan prime rates. The consensus, according to a Reuters poll, is that China will hold its key lending rates steady, a move that follows the central bank's decision to maintain another interest rate after the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent cut. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all saw early gains. The positive sentiment was buoyed by a strong week in U.S. markets, where the Dow and S&P 500 reached new record highs.</p>

          <p>German and Swedish fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian IL-20M reconnaissance plane flying without a transponder or flight plan in neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea. The German military visually identified the aircraft before handing off the escort to Swedish NATO partners. This incident is the latest in a series of recent Russian military incursions into or near NATO airspace, which have heightened regional tensions.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance's prominent and faith-focused role at Charlie Kirk's memorial service is being interpreted as a strategic move to solidify his position as a potential 2028 Republican presidential frontrunner. By emphasizing his Christian faith and aligning himself with Kirk's influential youth movement, Vance appears to be building a coalition that merges MAGA populism with Turning Point USA's activist base. His actions, including personally escorting Kirk's casket and guest-hosting his podcast, are seen as efforts to claim Kirk's mantle and appeal to evangelical voters. This positioning, combined with his appointment as RNC finance chair, suggests a well-underway soft launch for a future campaign.</p>

          <p>At a public memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump delivered a speech that blended eulogy with campaign-style rhetoric, telling tens of thousands of attendees that he "hates" his opponents. This comment stood in contrast to remarks from Kirk's widow, Erika, who had just offered forgiveness to the man charged with her husband's murder. Throughout the event, which featured numerous high-profile conservative figures, Trump veered from prepared remarks about Kirk's life to make off-the-cuff political statements and promote a future White House announcement on autism. Vice President JD Vance also spoke, framing Kirk as a "martyr for the Christian faith."</p>

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the move is not a "reward for Hamas" but rather an effort to revive hope for peace for both Palestinians and Israelis. The announcement drew a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established.

          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. The article outlines nine key practices, including talking openly about emotions, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than focusing on memorized phrases, these methods build a foundation of emotional safety and connection. Other crucial habits include teaching conflict resolution, validating a child's feelings, and listening more than lecturing, which helps children become emotionally intelligent and resilient adults.</p>

McFadden stated that reform is essential, as the current system is creating an "unhealthy" binary between those deemed fit for work and those not. The government plans to offer voluntary skills and employment support to tens of thousands on sickness benefits, aiming to help them re-enter the workforce amid forecasts of the benefits bill reaching £100 billion by 2030.</p>

          <p>On the island of Nantucket, scientists are pioneering a project to combat Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population, the primary carriers of the bacteria. The goal of the "Mice Against Ticks" project is to introduce a gene that provides heritable immunity to Lyme, meaning offspring will also be born immune. By making the mice resistant, ticks that feed on them will not become infected, thereby breaking the transmission cycle to humans without harming the mice or their role in the ecosystem. The project, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, is being developed in close consultation with the local community to ensure public buy-in before any potential release.</p>

This unique generation lives up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, allowing them to complete the arduous journey. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to threats like illegal logging in their wintering grounds and the eradication of milkweed plants in the U.S., which are essential for their caterpillars. Conservation efforts, including tagging butterflies and planting milkweed waystations, are underway to protect this iconic species and its mysterious, multi-generational pilgrimage.</p>

He argued that the UK government's approach is based on a miscalculation that it does not have to choose between the U.S. and the EU.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy and autism. According to reports, federal health officials will advise pregnant women to avoid the common painkiller unless they have a fever. President Trump teased a major announcement related to autism, which is expected to be delivered by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, has strongly refuted any causal link, citing over a decade of research and stating that such claims pose a health risk to expecting mothers by discouraging the use of one of the few safe fever-reducers available during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a separate deadly shootout involving police officers in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shapiro stated that the nation is at an "inflection point" and must choose healing and commonality over division. He referenced his own experience with political violence, including an April firebombing at the governor's mansion, to emphasize that such acts leave lasting scars. Shapiro distinguished between protected, albeit hateful, political speech and illicit incitement to violence, urging Americans to reject the latter regardless of its source.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that proved decisive in a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch with his foot to rob Brett Baty of extra bases after the ball was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the top of the fence to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez. The loss was costly for the Mets, dropping them into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wildcard spot.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would support a potential deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that involves freezing North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a production freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-term goal of complete denuclearization, given that Pyongyang is currently producing numerous new weapons annually. This pragmatic stance reflects a shift in policy aimed at reducing immediate tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Lee expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume talks, citing a degree of mutual trust between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>A group of families in south Wales is fighting to raise awareness about a "cluster" of cases of Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), a rare and progressive neurological disorder with no known cure. The inherited condition, once thought to primarily affect people of Japanese origin, was found to have a relatively high prevalence in Wales in a 2007 study. The article details the devastating impact on patients like Jessica Cowley, 20, who can no longer walk or talk. Families are calling for better access to genetic testing and information, as they navigate the challenges of a disease that many local doctors are unfamiliar with.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government hopes will spur economic growth. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. The airport claims the expansion will create jobs and boost the local economy. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions, arguing it contradicts the UK's legally binding climate commitments.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mountain lion, known as F390 and the mother of two 14-month-old cubs, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in San Juan Capistrano. According to the UC Davis California Carnivores Program, the adolescent cubs were still dependent on their mother for learning crucial survival and hunting skills. Researchers have since successfully placed a GPS tracking collar on the female cub to monitor her progress without her mother. The incident highlights the significant threat that road traffic poses to Southern California's fragmented mountain lion populations, with an estimated 100 killed by vehicles annually.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government has firmly rejected President Trump's recent statements suggesting the U.S. could retake control of Bagram Air Base, a sprawling military facility abandoned during the 2021 withdrawal. Trump had claimed talks were underway with Afghanistan and threatened "bad things" if the base was not returned. In response, a Taliban spokesman urged the U.S. to adhere to the Doha Agreement, in which Washington pledged not to threaten Afghanistan's territorial integrity. The Taliban emphasized that ceding any Afghan soil is "out of the question," dismissing the president's assertions and calling for a more realistic U.S. policy.</p>
