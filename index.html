          <p>This opinion article discusses the history of US presidents concealing their health problems from the public, drawing parallels to practices of aging dictators. It cites Joe Biden as the latest example, mentioning a new book and the recent announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer. The article suggests that the powers of a US president are akin to those of a dictator, albeit with term limits, and notes Donald Trump's public musings about a third term. It highlights how the political and media establishment in Washington allegedly covered up Biden’s declining mental health during his presidency.</p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister Taku Eto resigned after facing criticism for stating he doesn't buy rice because he receives so much from supporters, a remark deemed inappropriate given the soaring rice prices affecting the public. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and plans to replace him with Shinjiro Koizumi. Eto's comments came after the ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year. The scandal coincides with declining approval ratings for Ishiba amid public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising living costs.</p>

Gainey, the city's first Black mayor, had focused on affordable housing and attracted the 2026 NFL Draft to Pittsburgh.

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that Joe Kent, a top aide to the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, allegedly ordered intelligence analysts to revise an assessment of the relationship between Venezuela’s government and the Tren de Aragua gang. Kent's aim was to shield President Trump and Gabbard from criticism regarding the administration's claim that Venezuela controls the gang. Emails show Kent seeking rewrites to prevent the document from being used against the Director of National Intelligence or the President. The final memo still contradicted a key claim made by Trump to justify deporting alleged gang members.</p>

Japan is subject to a 25% levy on auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., as well as a 10% baseline tariff.

          <p>A federal court ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants on a deportation flight that immigrants’ lawyers said was headed to South Sudan, a transfer the judge said appeared to violate an injunction he issued in April.

The Judge warned that officials involved in the deportations who were aware of his order, including potentially the pilots of the plane, could face criminal sanctions. Lawyers said at least two migrants had been told they were going to be deported to South Sudan, a violence-plagued country in Africa that the State Department advises Americans not to travel to.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia has managed to maintain his position on negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine while continuing the war, but his broader goal of normalizing relations with the United States faces obstacles. Despite pressure for a cease-fire, Putin has secured President Trump's agreement to direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. However, Trump has linked economic rapprochement with Russia to peace in Ukraine, potentially delaying Russia's access to Western sanctions relief and foreign investment. This situation leaves Russia in an economic limbo, with its hopes for improved relations with the U.S. remaining uncertain.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new test that significantly reduces the time required to diagnose brain tumors, from weeks to hours. The "ultra-rapid" genetic testing method is considered a "game changer" by surgeons and could improve patient care. The method, developed at the University of Nottingham, has already been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumor types. The quicker diagnosis allows for more timely and effective treatment decisions, potentially reducing the need for multiple surgeries and alleviating patient anxiety.</p>
