          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a review of eight major Smithsonian museums to ensure their content aligns with the president's "American exceptionalism" directive. This review, prompted by a March executive order, will assess exhibition texts, curatorial processes, and online content for perceived partisan narratives. The Smithsonian stated its commitment to scholarly excellence and factual history while acknowledging the White House's letter. This move has raised concerns among critics about potential political influence over the nation's cultural and historical institutions.</p>

The post follows her previous openness about using the weight-loss drug Mounjaro after a difficult period in her life. Moakler explained that she had struggled emotionally following the deaths of both her parents in 2023, which also coincided with intense media scrutiny related to her ex-husband, Travis Barker.

          <p>Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. The meeting was announced by Trump after a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed. The choice of Alaska is symbolic, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867. The White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise" for Trump, aiming to understand Putin's position and urge an end to the conflict, though expectations for a concrete peace deal remain low.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, mandating more thorough background checks for police officer candidates statewide. The legislation is named after Sonya Massey, who was fatally shot in her home by a sheriff's deputy with a documented history of misconduct at previous law enforcement jobs. The new law requires agencies to review all prior employment records before making a job offer and compels applicants to authorize the release of these files. The measure, which passed with bipartisan support, aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from being rehired.</p>

          <p>A Union Pacific train derailed in Palo Pinto County, Texas, involving approximately 35 cars, many of which were carrying hazardous materials. The incident occurred over a railroad bridge, causing a pile-up of mangled train cars and sparking a grass fire that emergency crews worked to contain. Officials are treating the site as a hazardous materials situation out of caution, though they confirmed that none of the cars were leaking their contents. No injuries were reported, and the cause of the derailment is currently under investigation by the railroad company.</p>

          <p>The ongoing rivalry between Elon Musk and Sam Altman has intensified, with Musk now targeting Apple. Musk accused Apple of antitrust violations, alleging the company unfairly favors OpenAI's ChatGPT over his xAI's Grok in its App Store and threatened legal action. Altman responded by questioning Musk's own practices of manipulating his social media platform, X, to benefit his companies. The public dispute highlights the escalating competition in the AI sector and brings Apple's App Store policies, which are already under regulatory scrutiny, into the conflict between the two tech billionaires.</p>

          <p>Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier has started to release a massive volume of dammed-up water, leading to evacuation orders for some residents of Juneau. The phenomenon, known as a glacial outburst flood, occurs when the ice dam containing a basin of rainwater and snowmelt gives way. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning, predicting that the Mendenhall River could crest at a record high, posing a significant threat to homes along its banks. This has become an annual summer concern for the area as the glacier continues to thin and retreat due to climate change.</p>

          <p>This article details the legal framework President Trump is using to deploy the National Guard and assume temporary federal control over Washington, D.C.'s police force. Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the president can take command of the local police in an emergency, a move D.C.'s mayor called "unsettling." The D.C. National Guard, which the president directly controls, has been activated under Title 32, granting them law enforcement authority, though officials state their initial role is supportive. The deployment is part of a broader federal crackdown on crime in the capital.</p>

          <p>A theater critic describes attending a "Black Out" performance of the play "Berta, Berta," an event designated to provide a communal space for a Black audience. The critic, who is white, reflects on how the environment heightened his perception of the play's historical and emotional themes, which are rooted in the post-slavery Jim Crow era. He notes that the audience's knowing and empathetic reactions to the story of two lovers torn apart by racial injustice revealed a deeper realism in the work. The experience underscored the value of such initiatives in fostering a powerful, shared connection to art.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has reportedly instructed its companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 and certain AMD artificial intelligence chips, particularly for government and national security purposes. This directive comes shortly after the U.S. government confirmed it would allow the companies to resume shipping these less-advanced chips to China, but with a new condition that 15% of all China revenues be given to the U.S. government. The move signals an escalation in the U.S.-China tech rivalry, potentially limiting the market for American chipmakers in the key Chinese technology sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 33°C (91.4°F) in several locations. The sustained period of hot, dry weather has led to what experts call "nationally significant" water shortfalls, prompting hosepipe bans for millions of people. The heat is causing widespread environmental effects, damaging wildlife, increasing wildfire risk, and impacting farms during the crucial harvest season. Amber heat health alerts are in effect for large parts of the country, warning of potential risks to vulnerable individuals and the healthcare system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that even with inflation holding steady, pursuing debt forgiveness for high-interest credit card debt is still a sensible financial strategy. While stable consumer prices are positive, credit card interest rates remain at historic highs, often exceeding 20%, which far outpaces the rate of inflation. The analysis suggests that the economic certainty is still fragile, with potential tariff impacts looming, making high-rate debt a significant risk. Therefore, using the current stable period to eliminate or reduce this debt can free up cash flow for savings and prevent future financial distress. (not investment advice)</p>
