          <p>President Donald Trump declared an immediate halt to all trade negotiations with Canada, citing a "fraudulent" TV advertisement aired by Ontario's provincial government. The ad featured edited remarks from former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, which the Reagan Foundation stated misrepresented his 1987 address and was used without permission. Trump accused Canada of attempting to influence a pending U.S. Supreme Court case regarding his tariff policies, emphasizing tariffs' importance to U.S. national security and economy. This abrupt termination, the second instance of such action by Trump, signals a significant escalation in bilateral trade relations and highlights ongoing tensions over economic policy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 00:06:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate failed to advance a Republican-backed bill designed to ensure essential federal workers receive pay during the ongoing government shutdown, leaving many without guaranteed income. This legislative impasse underscores the severe partisan gridlock hindering efforts to resolve the shutdown and its cascading impacts. Democrats are reportedly holding out for an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, while Republicans blame them for the stalemate. The continued failure to fund these workers creates significant financial hardship and uncertainty for thousands of families across the nation, illustrating the broader political challenges facing the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anti-Trump "No Kings" rallies have featured protesters wearing inflatable animal costumes, such as frogs, lobsters, and unicorns, to counter Republican portrayals of them as "Hate America" radicals. This tactic, inspired by a Portland incident where an officer targeted a frog-suited protester, aims to use humor to undermine claims of the protests being violent "war zones." Political streamers raised funds to distribute these costumes, highlighting how absurdist humor can effectively challenge authority. Experts suggest this approach publicizes political messages while making any forceful government response appear disproportionate and farcical.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 00:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown poses an imminent threat to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially cutting off food aid for nearly 42 million Americans by November 1 and risking widespread hunger. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) also faces funding depletion. While the USDA attributes the crisis to Democrats, food aid advocates contend the agency possesses contingency reserves and a legal duty to maintain SNAP. States are bracing for a surge in demand at food banks, yet these resources are insufficient to mitigate the severe impact of lost federal funding on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Nexperia China, the chipmaker's primary entity in the country, publicly rejected its Dutch head office's directive to dismiss veteran Chinese executive Chang, asserting the order lacked legal effect within China due to violations of local company and labor laws. Chang, who began his career at Nexperia's former parent company in 2002, will maintain his leadership role over global sales, customer relations, and supply chain coordination. This unprecedented defiance from a Chinese subsidiary against its foreign parent company underscores the increasing complexities and potential jurisdictional conflicts faced by multinational corporations operating in China, particularly in critical technology sectors.</p>

Cuomo, running as an independent, reinforced criticisms of Mamdani's policies and perceived inexperience, asserting that Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, does not align with the Democratic Party's platform.

          <p>Following its fourth plenum, China's ruling Communist Party's Central Committee pledged to confront "major tests" and "tackle difficulties" by prioritizing technological upgrades and self-reliance, amidst a backdrop of "high winds, rough waves and raging storms." Officials at a subsequent press conference elaborated on these conclusions, which are anticipated to significantly influence the nation's forthcoming five-year plan for economic and social development. The communique emphasizes Beijing's unwavering resolve to overcome both internal and external challenges, particularly in critical strategic sectors, by fostering indigenous innovation and reducing its dependence on foreign technologies to achieve long-term stability and growth.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Louisiana awarded over $40 million in damages to the family of Erie Moore Sr., who tragically died in 2015 from head injuries sustained while in custody at the privately-run Richwood Correctional Center. The jury found three guards liable for negligence, battery, and excessive force, additionally holding LaSalle Management Co., the facility's operator, responsible for Moore's death. Moore, a 57-year-old father with no criminal history, was subjected to multiple pepper-spray deployments and captured on security footage being forcefully brought down, causing his head to hit the ground. This verdict is considered one of the highest jury awards for an in-custody death in U.S. history, offering some measure of justice for the family.</p>

Autumn had endured bullying both at school and through her smartphone. A recent Virginia Tech study highlights a strong correlation between nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines with teen suicide attempts, noting that approximately two-thirds of overdoses occurred after 8 p.m., with three out of four victims using screens beforehand. Dr. Abhishek Reddy recommends removing phones from bedrooms and limiting medication access to reduce these significant risks.</p>

China's ambitious commitments to achieve peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060 have driven a significant increase in renewable energy's share of total power generation capacity, rising from 40% to approximately 60% since 2021, demonstrating a clear long-term vision.</p>
