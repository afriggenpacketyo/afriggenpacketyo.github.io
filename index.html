          <p>China's state-backed "national team" investors, spearheaded by Central Huijin Investment, held a substantial 3.94 trillion yuan (US$553.1 billion) in yuan-denominated stocks by the end of June. This significant state presence, which surpassed foreign investors' holdings, accounts for 4.8% of the publicly tradable market capitalization, second only to mutual funds. The article highlights how these massive holdings have contributed to a decade-high benchmark for onshore stocks, reflecting top leaders' efforts to promote financial stability and position the stock market as a wealth preservation tool amid a property market downturn. Analysts anticipate that this robust state support for the market will persist, potentially leading to further stock increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has revealed that Labour MPs are privately urging him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership and ultimately the prime ministership. While denying active plotting, Burnham did not rule out a future leadership bid, referencing his two previous attempts. The article highlights his criticism of Number 10's "climate of fear" and calls for "wholesale change" to counter what he perceives as an "existential" threat to Labour, particularly from Reform UK. Burnham also outlined several policy proposals, including higher council tax on expensive homes and income tax cuts for lower earners, as he positions himself for a potential return to Westminster and a leadership role.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Aalborg airport was forced to close after multiple unauthorized drones were spotted in its airspace, with three other smaller southern airports also reporting similar activity. This incident closely follows a recent closure of Copenhagen airport due to a drone incursion, which the prime minister described as the "most severe attack on Danish infrastructure so far." While police are investigating the motives and controllers, they cannot rule out a prank, though Russian involvement was also suggested for the earlier Copenhagen incident. The article highlights heightened security concerns across Europe, with several NATO members reporting recent Russian airspace violations, underscoring a tense geopolitical climate and the challenges of protecting critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The BBC, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP), and Reuters have launched a short film, narrated by David Dimbleby, urging Israel to permit foreign journalists independent access to Gaza.

The article emphasizes the critical need for foreign reporters to work alongside their Palestinian counterparts, who have faced immense casualties, to ensure comprehensive and factual reporting of the ongoing conflict.

He stands accused of illegally accepting campaign contributions from the late Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, facilitated by Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine. Takieddine, the key accuser who recently died, claimed to have delivered €5 million in cash between 2006 and 2007, allegedly in return for Sarkozy's help in rehabilitating Gadhafi's international image.

This shift reflects a growing determination among Gulf rulers to pursue greater strategic autonomy and hedge against perceived unreliability from the US, signaling a move towards a Gulf-led security pole.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled it unconstitutional for the Trump administration to mandate states cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. US District Judge William Smith sided with 20 states, mostly Democratic, that accused FEMA of "holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage." The article notes that the ruling is a legal setback for the administration's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" cities and states that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). New York Attorney General Letitia James hailed the decision, stating the federal government cannot prioritize its immigration agenda over public safety.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has temporarily stayed the planned execution of nearly 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm, following an avian flu outbreak and the owners' protest against the cull order. This decision halts the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) culling while the farm owners appeal, after being briefly arrested for obstructing agents. The article notes the case has garnered international attention, including calls from US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy to study the birds instead. The CFIA maintains the cull is necessary to prevent virus mutation and human health risks, highlighting the ongoing legal and public health dispute surrounding animal welfare and disease control.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI will largely be used by the AI startup to lease Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), rather than outright purchases. The article reveals that OpenAI plans to spread the cost of these crucial chips over their useful life, potentially up to five years, thereby shifting more risk to Nvidia. This arrangement, part of the "monumental" deal, provides OpenAI with cost-efficient access to the immense compute power needed to build and train large language models and run AI workloads. While some investors express concern over the "circular nature" of the deal, OpenAI's CFO emphasizes the critical need for compute capacity and the company's focus on driving real demand and future revenue growth.

          <p>Massachusetts cranberry farmers, facing economic headwinds from falling prices and rising costs, are increasingly participating in a state program to restore unproductive bogs into wetlands. This initiative, part of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program, pays farmers to convert their land, with over 500 acres already restored and another 500 planned. The article highlights that this program offers a sustainable solution for farmers, many nearing retirement, to preserve their land while providing significant environmental benefits like improved water quality, carbon storage, and enhanced storm resilience.

Critics argue this approach compromises accountability, allowing polluters to act with impunity. The EA maintains it responds to all reports, using various assessment methods, but campaigners highlight a pattern of slow response and reliance on self-reporting.</p>
