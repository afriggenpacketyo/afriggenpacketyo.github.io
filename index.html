          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35A fighter jets equipped with nuclear capabilities, bolstering NATO's airborne nuclear mission. This move marks a significant strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture, according to Downing Street. These dual-capability jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The decision, announced by the prime minister at a NATO summit, has been praised by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte as a robust contribution to the alliance and is expected to support 20,000 jobs across the UK supply chain. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review, which confirmed new nuclear risks, with other states increasing, modernizing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has chosen Louisiana for its largest data center to date, a $10 billion hub for AI operations. The state offered a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029 to secure the project. The data center will create 500 permanent jobs and 5,000 construction jobs, however it will also consume twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day. Entergy Louisiana is seeking approval to build three gas-fired power plants at the site to meet Meta's energy demands, representing a $3 billion investment in infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are currently stuck in a holding pattern, showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and military conflicts. Last week, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88%, with applications to buy a home dropping 0.4%. Rates have remained in a narrow range around 7% since early April, offering little incentive to homebuyers facing high prices and low supply.

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe have declined for the fifth consecutive month in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). Tesla's car sales in the European Union, Britain, and the European Free Trade Association fell by 27.9% year-on-year, resulting in a drop in market share. This decline is attributed to increasing competition from traditional automakers and cheaper Chinese electric vehicles, with BYD registering nearly as many vehicles as Tesla in May. Tesla's revamped Model Y compact sport utility vehicle was hoped to turn the company's fortunes around, but the company continues to struggle in the European market.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but initially voiced frustration as both sides were accused of violating the agreement. Despite the announced ceasefire, Israel accused Iran of launching missiles, resulting in casualties, and responded with further strikes. Trump intervened, urging Israel to halt bombings and warning of a major violation, and the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem reopened. The conflict, lasting 12 days, resulted in at least 1,000 deaths and raised concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its chicken Snack Wrap, and Popeyes introduced new chicken wraps, signaling a resurgence of the wrap trend from the 1990s. The wrap's popularity is tied to societal anxieties about body image and dieting, offering a lower-calorie alternative to traditional sandwiches. As trends shift again, with a renewed focus on thinness and weight loss, wraps are making a comeback as a functional and seemingly virtuous food choice. The article suggests that the return of the wrap reflects a broader revival of diet culture and the aesthetic values of the '90s.</p>

          <p>Struggling households in the UK owe billions in unpaid council tax, with bills expected to rise further. Figures show £6.6bn is owed to local authorities in England, and the Treasury assumes council tax will rise by 5% a year. Campaigners are calling for a more sympathetic approach to debt collection, rather than the use of bailiffs. The government plans to cap fees added to debt and loosen rules on full-year bill liability, but the Local Government Association warns that bills will continue to rise for those who can least afford to pay if councils are not adequately funded.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, intelligence agencies are working to understand the extent of the damage, with initial assessments labeled as "low confidence." A leaked Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggests that the core components of Iran's nuclear program have not been destroyed, setting back efforts by months rather than years. Developing a clearer picture requires various forms of intelligence, including satellite images, seismic detectors, radiation sniffers, and informers. Even if sites like Fordo were severely damaged, Iran could reconstitute its program at new locations, intensifying the work of intelligence agencies in the coming months.</p>

The debate revolves around alleged informal promises made by Western powers regarding NATO's eastward expansion after the Cold War. Experts disagree on whether these promises were binding commitments or merely suggestions, but it is incontrovertibly true that Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump will make a full state visit to the UK later this year after scheduling conflicts prevented an informal meeting over the summer. Buckingham Palace confirmed that an invitation signed by King Charles was delivered to the White House. The dates for the visit are yet to be confirmed, but September is considered the most likely timeframe. This visit marks Trump's second state visit to the UK, with the first occurring in 2019 when he was hosted by Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

          <p>Airlift Technology is using drones to transport supplies up Mount Everest and remove waste on the descent, addressing the mountain's trash crisis. After successful trials in 2024, the company estimates it removed over one metric tonne of trash between March and May 2025. The drones can quickly transport up to 33 lbs of critical supplies, helping sherpas navigate difficult sections like the Khumbu Icefall. This innovation is welcomed by mountaineers, as it reduces the risk of carrying heavy equipment and helps save lives.</p>

Gen Z, the queerest generation in American history, is facing the erosion of their status quo, with homophobic rhetoric resurging and rights being rescinded.

          <p>A Republican budget bill in Congress proposes massive Medicaid cuts that could lead to millions of Americans losing health insurance benefits. The legislation, which has been approved by the House and is now being debated in the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. This could result in 10.3 million fewer people being enrolled in the program by 2034, reversing recent gains in reducing the number of uninsured Americans. An analysis suggests that these coverage losses could lead to between 8,200 and 24,600 additional annual deaths.</p>

Rising cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, poor food choices, and physical inactivity are contributing to the increase in these other heart conditions.

Allies are working on a new commitment to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, though Trump has expressed ambivalence about Article 5, the mutual defense clause in the NATO treaty. The White House has dismissed claims that the strikes on Iran caused only limited damage.</p>

          <p>NATO allies, including President Trump, reaffirmed their commitment to collective defense, as outlined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. However, the communique lacked a condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine, which had been included in previous statements during the Biden administration. While the document described Russia as a "long-term threat," it did not mention NATO membership for Ukraine. Allies also agreed to increase defense spending, committing to invest 5% of GDP annually on core defense requirements and security-related spending by 2035.</p>
