          <p>Kerri Pegg, a 42-year-old prison governor once considered a rising star in the Prison Service, has been sentenced to nine years in jail for engaging in a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, a drug-dealing gang leader. Pegg abused her position at HMP Kirkham by helping Saunderson secure day release and accepted a Â£12,000 Mercedes C-class car funded by drug money. The judge emphasized that Pegg had betrayed public trust and acted unconscionably, ignoring training and warnings. The investigation revealed that Pegg was living beyond her means, accumulating significant debt and designer items, making her vulnerable to corruption and blackmail.</p>

          <p>Apple has denied Epic Games' request to resubmit Fortnite to the iOS App Store, intensifying the ongoing conflict over payment structures. Epic Games claims that this decision prevents the game's release on the U.S. App Store and the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Apple stated it requested Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront to avoid impacting Fortnite in other regions. This action follows a recent court ruling that Apple cannot charge commissions on purchases made outside of an iOS app.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget package faced a significant setback as conservative Republicans blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee, citing insufficient federal spending cuts. Five Republicans opposed the legislation, demanding quicker implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients and phasing out green subsidies. The budget includes extensions of tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term, increased military spending, and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy. Negotiations continue to resolve disagreements between factions within the party, including blue-state Republicans seeking higher state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Plunges Amid Inflation Expectations Following Tariff Announcements</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has dropped to its second-lowest level on record, according to the University of Michigan survey, driven by increasing concerns that tariffs will lead to higher inflation. The index of consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 in May, while year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3%. Despite a recent pause on most tariffs between the U.S. and China, consumers remain uncertain about trade policy and its impact on the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized the importance of keeping long-term inflation expectations stable before resuming rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey's Instagram post featuring the numbers "86 47" has sparked controversy, with some interpreting it as a call for violence against President Trump.

The article explores the various etymologies of "86," from its origins in Prohibition-era bars to its use in military logistics. The post has ignited political debate, with Republicans accusing Comey of inciting violence and Democrats criticizing the right for misinterpreting his intent.</p>

A significant turnabout included a meeting with Syriaâ€™s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing long-standing U.S. policies, and lifting sanctions on Syria. The visit resulted in deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including a large order from Qatar for Boeing passenger jets, though some details remain unclear.

          <p>A $50,000 annuity can supplement retirement income, providing guaranteed monthly payouts that offer peace of mind and protection against longevity risk. The amount paid per month varies based on age, gender, and annuity contract. Purchasing an annuity at age 60 could yield approximately $285 to $294 per month, while waiting until age 75 could increase the monthly income to around $395 to $425. Although annuities lack flexibility and may not be suitable for all retirees, they can provide consistent income, making them a valuable addition to a retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
