          <p>A powerful storm with winds exceeding 60 mph struck central New Jersey, resulting in multiple fatalities and significant damage. The towns of Plainfield and North Plainfield were particularly hard-hit, prompting Plainfield's mayor to declare a state of emergency. Due to the widespread damage and tragic loss of life, the town has canceled its Fourth of July parade, concert, and fireworks display. Governor Phil Murphy urged residents to remain indoors to avoid dangers from toppled trees and downed power lines as recovery efforts begin.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it is consulting with other Palestinian factions before formally responding to the latest U.S.-proposed ceasefire and hostage release plan. President Trump indicated he expects a decision from Hamas within 24 hours on the proposal, which Israel has reportedly accepted. The plan is believed to involve a 60-day truce, a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and negotiations for a permanent end to the war. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations continue in Gaza, with recent strikes in Khan Younis resulting in at least 15 Palestinian casualties.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway after a series of powerful explosions destroyed a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, leaving seven people unaccounted for. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics also injured two people and sparked multiple grass fires. Authorities, including the ATF, are now investigating the site, which public records indicate may have ties to a local sheriff's lieutenant and was operating without the necessary local permits for fireworks storage. Family members of the missing, including three young men who were working at the facility, are anxiously awaiting news.</p>

          <p>A large explosion at a petrol station in Rome's Prenestino neighborhood has injured at least 29 people and caused extensive damage. The incident reportedly began with a smaller blast after a tanker truck hit a pipe, causing a gas leak that emergency services were already addressing. A subsequent, much larger explosion then occurred, creating a massive fireball that was seen and felt across the city. Rome's mayor described the impact as "terrible," noting that the evacuation of nearby buildings just before the main blast likely prevented a more severe tragedy.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology suggests that the definition of "cool" is consistent across different cultures. Researchers surveyed nearly 6,000 people in a dozen countries and found that individuals perceived as "cool" share six key traits: they are seen as more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous. The study distinguishes "coolness" from "goodness," noting that while there can be overlap, cool people possess traits not always associated with being morally good. The findings suggest coolness is a fundamental concept linked to pushing boundaries and sparking change.</p>

          <p>A 90-day pause on extensive U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty as the Trump administration negotiates new global trade terms. If new bilateral deals are not reached, steep import duties could take effect, potentially triggering inflation and harming U.S. businesses. While the administration has announced agreements with China, the U.K., and Vietnam, dozens of other deals remain unresolved. Experts speculate the deadline may be extended for some nations, while others could face the scheduled tariff hikes, prolonging the instability for companies trying to plan for the future.

          <p>Archaeologists in northern England have unearthed a collection of "unusually large" 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. Eight of the shoes found in a defensive ditch are over 30cm long, with one equivalent to a modern U.S. size 15. This proportion of large footwear is significantly higher than at other Roman sites like Vindolanda. Researchers are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at Magna to understand why so many large-footed individuals might have been present at this specific location.</p>

          <p>A trial has begun for two brothers accused of assaulting three police officers during a widely filmed brawl at Manchester airport last summer. Prosecutors allege that the confrontation in the Terminal 2 car park followed an earlier incident where one of the brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, headbutted and punched a man in a Starbucks. When police attempted to arrest him, he and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, allegedly resisted and violently assaulted the officers, breaking one officer's nose. The defendants deny the charges, claiming they acted in self-defense.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece, written by three legal professionals, argues that celebrating American freedom on the Fourth of July feels contradictory amid a perceived backslide in democracy and civil rights. The authors contend that the gap between American ideals and reality has always existed for marginalized communities but is now becoming more apparent to all. They reject despair, advocating instead for grassroots action and community engagement as the most powerful response. The article calls on people to connect, act locally, and envision a more just future to transform and defend the nation's democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Community volunteers in Springfield, Ohio, are urgently working to help Haitian families obtain U.S. passports for their American-born children. The effort comes as the Trump administration moves to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, which could force their deportation. Without passports for their children, these parents could be separated from their U.S.-citizen kids or face immense difficulty taking them if they are forced to leave the country. The initiative aims to prevent a potential humanitarian crisis where thousands of children could become stateless or be placed in the foster care system.</p>

          <p>This analysis contrasts Apple's recent major success with its blockbuster movie "F1" against its perceived struggles in the field of artificial intelligence. The film's triumph highlights Apple's strength in long-term investment and marketing, growing its services division into a cultural force. However, the company's recent AI announcements at its developer conference were seen as underwhelming, with its Siri voice assistant falling far behind competitors like ChatGPT. The article suggests that while Apple's loyal customer base provides a buffer, its lack of competitive AI could become a significant problem in the coming years.</p>

Other notable trends were the rise of chef-led consumer brands, a more taste-focused approach to plant-based foods, and the niche but growing popularity of cooking with beef tallow.</p>

          <p>This review of the new film 'Jurassic World Rebirth' criticizes it as a "pointless sequel" that fails to recapture the magic of the original franchise. While director Gareth Edwards is credited with creating impressive scale and visually clean action sequences, the movie is described as plodding and disenchanting. The plot, a familiar mix of mercenaries and a shipwrecked family on a dinosaur-filled island, is deemed unoriginal. The review concludes that the film lacks memorable characters, narrative stakes, and a compelling reason to exist beyond being a summer box office draw.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its most extensive aerial attack on Kyiv since the war began, injuring at least 23 people and causing severe damage across the Ukrainian capital. The seven-hour barrage involved a combination of 550 drones and missiles targeting cities across the country. The attack coincided with a phone call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which Ukrainian President Zelenskyy interpreted as a signal of Moscow's intent to continue the war. This assault is part of a broader Russian strategy of escalating long-range attacks while pushing to gain ground along the front lines.</p>
