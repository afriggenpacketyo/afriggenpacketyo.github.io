          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, aiming for a permanent end to the conflict, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. The response includes amendments, particularly regarding U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, aid delivery, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The proposed deal involves the release of living Israeli hostages and the remains of deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, as well as immediate humanitarian aid to Gaza. The UN reports dire conditions in Gaza, with food trucks being stopped and offloaded by desperate civilians amid a severe blockade, highlighting the urgent need for large-scale aid to rebuild trust and ease the humanitarian crisis.

          <p>The European Union has criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, stating that it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson said that the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures in response to the increased tariffs, which are set to take effect on June 4. The United Steelworkers union also criticized Trump's announcement, calling it a direct attack on Canadian industries and workers. The EU had paused its countermeasures against the U.S. on April 14 to allow time for negotiations, but is ready to reinstate those measures if no mutually acceptable solution is reached.</p>

          <p>Michelle Obama is facing backlash for stating that creating life is "the least" of what a woman's reproductive system does, during a podcast episode with OB/GYN Dr. Sharon Malone. She lamented that women's reproductive health has been reduced to the question of choice and argued that a lack of research on women's health shapes male leaders' perceptions of abortion. Obama criticized Republican men for trading women's health for tax breaks and suggested Republican women voted for President Trump because of their husbands. Pro-life activists and commentators have criticized her remarks, arguing that motherhood is a beautiful and powerful gift and that creating life is a miracle.</p>

          <p>A teenager and two adults in their 40s died in a single-vehicle crash on the M5 in South Gloucestershire. A second child sustained serious injuries and was taken to the hospital following the incident, which occurred when a white BMW left the northbound carriageway. The road was initially closed in both directions due to the severity of the crash, but the southbound motorway and two lanes of the northbound carriageway have since reopened. One northbound lane and the entry slip road at junction 14 remain closed as investigators continue their work at the scene.</p>

          <p>Germany's radical right party, AfD, is aligning with traditional Christian culture and values, exploiting fears about Islam and societal change, despite not being overtly religious itself. The AfD uses references to Christian values to attack Islam, warning of the downfall of Western civilization and "population replacement" due to immigration. The party's stance against abortion and the queer community, particularly transgenderism, reflects an effort to capitalize on social uncertainty. Critics view the AfD's relationship with Christianity as instrumental, drawing on traditions when it suits their agenda, without cultivating close ties with the churches.</p>

This action follows the discovery of five dead Mexican musicians in Reynosa, highlighting the dangers faced by musicians in cartel-dominated areas.

          <p>Ukraine requires financial assistance, specifically the â‚¬300bn of frozen Russian assets, to effectively combat Russia. Confiscating these assets would shock Putin, undermine domestic support for the war, and boost Ukraine's morale. Despite warnings from Euroclear about undermining Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, analysts argue that the Russia situation is an extreme case and should not deter the EU from seizing the funds. While some interest from the assets is being given to Ukraine, a full seizure is necessary to demonstrate unity and provide substantial support to Ukraine's war efforts.</p>

          <p>Trump's recent pardons of rapper NBA YoungBoy and gangster Larry Hoover are viewed as a cynical attempt to garner support from the Black community, rather than a genuine act of justice. These pardons are seen as a calculated move to appeal to famous, wealthy Black individuals who seek to ingratiate themselves with those in power. Despite widespread disapproval of Trump among Black voters, some Black celebrities continue to support him, highlighting a divide within the community. This action is perceived as a superficial gesture that ignores the systemic issues and needs of Black Americans.</p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, reports that Iran has significantly increased its production of highly enriched uranium, now possessing over 400kg enriched to 60% purity, a near 50% increase in three months. This level is well above civilian use and close to weapons grade, making Iran the only non-nuclear armed state producing uranium at this level, although Iran maintains its program is peaceful. The IAEA cannot confirm whether it remains so, and the increased production rate is equivalent to roughly one nuclear weapon per month. Israel has accused Iran of being "totally determined" to acquire nuclear weapons, while Iran maintains that it considers nuclear weapons "unacceptable."</p>
