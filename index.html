          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:43:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following intense public interest and pressure from conservatives, the U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested a court to unseal the grand jury records related to the federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. The move was announced by President Trump, who directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release, stating that transparency is of utmost importance. This decision comes after the DOJ initially stated no further disclosures were warranted, and amid Trump's own legal threats against The Wall Street Journal for a separate report about his connection to Epstein. The filing emphasizes that victim-related information will be redacted to protect their privacy during the process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent congressional vote to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting will have a disproportionately severe impact on rural communities across the United States. Tom Michael, the general manager of Boise State Public Radio, explains that smaller stations like his rely heavily on federal funds to operate and provide essential local news and emergency information. Without this support, many rural stations face the threat of service reductions or complete shutdowns. This would leave many Americans in less populated areas without a trusted, non-commercial source of local and national programming, creating significant information gaps.</p>

          <p>U.S. tech company Astronomer has launched a formal investigation following a viral video from a Coldplay concert. The clip, shown on the venue's large screen, captured two people, rumored to be the company's CEO and chief people officer, in an embrace before they abruptly hid from the camera. The incident, amplified by a comment from Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin, sparked widespread online speculation about an affair. While the company has not verified the identities of the individuals, it released a statement affirming its commitment to accountability and professional conduct among its leadership.</p>

          <p>Ten Americans who were being held in Venezuela have been freed and are on their way back to the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Trump's leadership for securing their release, stating that every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free. The release was part of a broader prisoner exchange deal involving El Salvador, which agreed to repatriate hundreds of Venezuelan nationals held in its prisons. The administration reiterated its commitment to bringing home all Americans held hostage or unjustly detained abroad and continues to support the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>A complex prisoner exchange has resulted in the release of 10 U.S. nationals from Venezuelan custody. The deal involved El Salvador repatriating approximately 250 detained Venezuelans, who had been deported from the U.S. to a high-security Salvadoran prison, in exchange for the Americans and a number of Venezuelan political prisoners. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and U.S. officials confirmed the arrangement, which a senior U.S. official described as being "down to the wire." The successful negotiation highlights the warming relationship between the Trump administration and President Bukele, who played a critical facilitating role in the deal.</p>

Initially, President Trump resisted calls for more transparency, frustrated with his base's focus on the issue, but a Wall Street Journal report about a letter he allegedly sent to Epstein forced a change in strategy. The article details the internal White House debates and the president's anger at "disloyal" supporters and media figures who profited from the controversy.

          <p>Microsoft has changed its support protocols to ensure that its engineers based in China will no longer provide technical assistance for the company's U.S. defense and government cloud clients. The move is a response to national security concerns, highlighted in a recent ProPublica report, about the potential cybersecurity risks of having foreign engineers involved with sensitive Pentagon contracts. The report detailed an arrangement where U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervised more technically proficient engineers in China. Microsoft stated it is committed to providing the most secure services possible and will adjust its security protocols as needed.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He also stated that while he is not a "proponent" of agents wearing masks during arrests, he will continue to allow the practice due to a more than 800% increase in attacks against ICE personnel. Lyons attributed the rise in both agent visibility and attacks to an increase in enforcement operations, which he argued are necessary because of "sanctuary" policies limiting local law enforcement cooperation with the agency.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is still in negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs that were announced in April but subsequently paused for 90 days. The administration had slated a 32 percent tariff rate for Taiwan due to its substantial trade surplus with the U.S., a key issue for President Trump. Taiwanese and U.S. officials have met three times since the initial announcement, suggesting a mutual effort to reach a manageable agreement. Analysts believe the absence of a final decision indicates that talks are ongoing, as Taiwan, a critical supplier of advanced semiconductors to American tech firms, hopes to avoid the most severe proposed tariffs.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democratic figures, including Senators Adam Schiff, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, are condemning CBS's decision to cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." They are raising concerns that the move may be politically motivated, coming just days after Colbert criticized the network's parent company, Paramount, for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump. The lawmakers are calling for transparency, suggesting the cancellation could be an attack on free speech, especially given Paramount's pending merger with Skydance, owned by the son of a Trump ally. CBS has stated the decision was purely financial.</p>

          <p>The latest big-screen adaptation of "Smurfs" is described as a messy and strained experience that fails to offer nostalgia or genuine enchantment. The review criticizes the film for its frantic pace, random gags, and an overly complicated plot involving cosmic guardians and multiple dimensions, which feels beholden to current superhero trends. Despite a talented voice cast including Rihanna and John Goodman, the story is deemed incoherent and the humor feels forced. The film's ultimate message of togetherness is lost amidst the chaotic, attention-driven wackiness, making it a disappointing entry in the franchise.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that members of Congress, particularly Republicans, are increasingly abdicating their legislative responsibilities by voting for bills they privately oppose or hope will be changed later. The article cites examples like Senator Josh Hawley voting for Medicaid cuts he publicly criticized, and others supporting measures while pleading for the other chamber to fix them. This behavior of "voting yes and hoping no" is seen as a surrender of congressional power to the executive branch. The author contends that this "preening cowardice" allows President Trump to seize more authority, a strategy outlined in plans like Project 2025.</p>

Despite no fundamental improvement in Opendoor's business, which remains unprofitable, Jackson's growing social media influence appears to have fueled a speculative frenzy.

While the fee may be reimbursed if visa holders comply with all restrictions, such as timely departure, the mechanisms for collection and reimbursement have not yet been established.

Linear television viewership is declining, production costs are high, and the cultural power of talk shows has waned in the age of streaming and social media.
