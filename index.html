          <p>Despite ongoing prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles targeting cities across Ukraine, marking the fourth consecutive night of large-scale attacks. Ukraine's air force reported neutralizing a significant number of the incoming projectiles, but strikes were reported in multiple regions, causing casualties, including children. Poland, a NATO member bordering Ukraine, scrambled its fighter jets in response to the Russian activity. Ukrainian leaders have condemned the attacks, citing them as evidence that Moscow is not genuine in its appeals for peace. The strikes occurred even as a multi-day prisoner exchange process, the largest since the conflict began, commenced. Optimism remains low as the conflict continues. </p>

          <p>A Kyodo News poll indicates that 59.8% of respondents in Japan expect rice prices to decrease following the appointment of a new farm minister. This expectation comes after the previous minister's sacking due to a gaffe concerning rice prices. The poll reflects public sentiment regarding the potential impact of governmental changes on the agricultural sector and the cost of essential goods. It is expected that the new farm minister will address public concerns and work towards stabilizing rice prices. The appointment of a new minister has been met with general optimism by the public.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government in the UK, marking a significant shift in the country's rail policy. The government has stated that the move is intended to improve services and reinvest profits into infrastructure. While the government has refrained from promising lower fares, unions have voiced concerns about potential outsourcing of staffing to private companies. The renationalized SWR trains will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. This event is seen as a potential turning point for the future of the rail system.</p>

          <p>Five years after the surge of racial justice protests in 2020, a panel discusses the changes and lack thereof around the world. Osita Nwanevu notes that while many reform bills were drafted, momentum has stalled in the US, and police funding has often increased. Fabiana Moraes highlights the continued killings of Black people in Brazil and the fear of anti-racist movements. Adam Elliott-Cooper points to modest gains in Britain that were short-lived, while Zanele Mji observes a disparity in support between US and African struggles. Abeo Jackson notes little meaningful change in Trinidad and Tobago. Overall, the panel suggests that much work remains to achieve lasting systemic change.</p>

Experts emphasize the need for closer cooperation between the government and businesses to enhance cybersecurity and resilience.
