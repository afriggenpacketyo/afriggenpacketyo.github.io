          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator reported that President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum was not raised during recent talks with U.S. officials in Washington. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister in charge of economic policy, met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent amidst Trump's announcement on social media regarding the tariff increase, citing national security concerns. Akazawa stated that the Japanese government would closely monitor the specific details of the measures, and he was instructed to continue negotiating with the highest priority of reaching an agreement. Akazawa also expressed optimism regarding Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp. and mentioned arrangements for a meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit.

          <p>A Chinese scientific team has traced the origins of modern Tibetans' "ghost ancestors" to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. Scientists have determined that around 80% of the genetic composition of Tibetan Plateau populations originates from northern Chinese populations dating back 9,500 to 4,000 years ago. This research fills a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia and identifies one of the Tibetan Plateau‚Äôs ‚Äúghost ancestors‚Äù.</p>

          <p>Aviation reporter Darryl Campbell discusses the systemic issues contributing to the air travel crisis, exemplified by problems at Newark Liberty International Airport. Newark has experienced radar outages and staffing shortages, leading to near misses and increased stress for air traffic controllers. These issues are not isolated to Newark but are indicative of broader problems facing airports nationwide, including aging infrastructure, staffing challenges, and funding shortfalls. While short-term fixes have been announced, long-term solutions require addressing the root causes of these problems, such as increasing air traffic controller pay and consistent funding for maintenance and upgrades.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough choices are unavoidable as the government finalizes spending plans, with health spending levels dictating potential cuts to other areas. While funding increased sharply in 2024 for various sectors, it will no longer increase year-on-year, prompting concerns about maintaining services like policing and capping bus fares. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's stance on borrowing and taxes has fueled speculation about spending cuts, with the IFS suggesting a huge amount depends on the generosity of NHS funding.

          <p>Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back argue that lessons from past poor people's movements are crucial for resisting Donald Trump's policies. They highlight the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as a model for building popular power. The authors emphasize the importance of uniting across differences, assuming strong leadership, building visionary projects of survival, and using these projects as bases for broader organizing. They propose the Johnnie Tillmon model as a strategic framework for transforming growing indignation into lasting power.</p>

          <p>Some Social Security beneficiaries may see smaller checks in June due to the resumption of student loan garnishments. The Trump administration announced that the U.S. Department of Education would resume collection activity on defaulted student loans. Over 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default and likely to receive Social Security benefits, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. There are options for borrowers to stop the payment offsets, including exploring multiple repayment plans and rehabilitation programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Republican-led budget bill proposal restricting graduate federal student loans could worsen the national doctor shortage, according to experts.

Medical students rely heavily on federal loans to finance their education, and advocates warn that these changes could deter low-income students from pursuing medicine. These changes could also exacerbate the flight of doctors from lower-paid specialties, especially family medicine, primary care, and pediatrics.</p>
