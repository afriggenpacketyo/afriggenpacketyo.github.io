          <p>An investigation reveals that ticket touts, who resell tickets at inflated prices, allegedly received assistance from staff at major ticketing firms. These touts exploited loopholes and used fraudulent practices to bypass ticket limits, generating millions in profits. Former employees claim they worked closely with touts, offering financial incentives and developing software to facilitate bulk ticket sales on resale sites. Ticketmaster denies current involvement in uncapped resale markets and asserts its commitment to fair ticketing, stating the allegations pertain to companies dissolved in 2018 and events from over a decade ago. The situation highlights the challenges in combating ticket touting and ensuring fair access for fans. </p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border as a goodwill gesture. The decision, initiated by President Lee Jae-myung, aims to foster trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which included K-pop songs and messages critical of the North Korean regime, were resumed last year in response to North Korea's balloon campaign involving trash-laden balloons sent into South Korean territory. While North Korea has not yet responded, this move signals a shift towards reconciliation after heightened tensions fueled by military exercises and nuclear ambitions. </p>

The exhibition aims to provide an opportunity for collective grief and remembrance, addressing the stigma and lack of proper mourning during the 1980s and 1990s.

          <p>Newspaper headlines present contrasting views on the chancellor's Spending Review, with some praising it as a plan for "renewing Britain" while others criticize it as a "reckless splurge." The NHS and defense sectors are highlighted as major beneficiaries, but concerns are raised about potential tax increases and budget cuts for other departments, such as the police. Economists suggest that tax rises are inevitable to balance the books, and military leaders express concerns that the spending plans are inadequate for the Armed Forces. The review is seen as a rejection of austerity, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns of tighter conditions from mid-2026. </p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, revealing a dark chapter of Cold War history. The site, one of four constructed during the U.S. military occupation, housed Mace B cruise missiles capable of striking China and parts of the Soviet Union. The site was made ready for war during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Following Okinawa's return to Japanese rule, the site was purchased by a Buddhist organization and restored to promote awareness of the region's nuclear past. The reopening serves as a reminder of the tensions and fears of nuclear conflict during the Cold War era. </p>

While Japan has improved women's participation in the economic arena, it lags behind in political empowerment.
