        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing historically low approval ratings, prominent Democrats are reassessing their previous support for President Biden's 2024 re-election bid. Some, like Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Ro Khanna, now acknowledge Biden's cognitive decline and unsuitability for office, while others, including Pete Buttigieg and Governor Josh Shapiro, suggest the party could have fared better with a different candidate. Despite these admissions, some Democratic figures defend their past endorsements, highlighting the power of incumbency at the time. This internal reckoning could shape the party's direction and candidate selection for the 2028 presidential primary, especially in light of a new book detailing efforts to shield Biden as his condition worsened.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has encountered significant obstacles within the House of Representatives, as Republicans fail to pass the measure through the budget committee due to internal disagreements over the extent of budget cuts. Primary points of contention include the amount to be cut from the budget, specifically concerning Medicaid, with some conservatives demanding steeper reductions. Lawmakers from states with high taxes also object to the proposed cap on state and local tax deductions, further complicating the bill's passage, highlighting the deep divisions within the Republican Party regarding fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Teachers at Westbourne Academy in Ipswich, England, have initiated a strike due to escalating concerns about student behavior, including incidents of students throwing scissors and chairs. Teachers cite a lack of consistent disciplinary action and inadequate support from senior leadership as contributing factors. Social media and mobile phone usage are also believed to play a role in the disruptive behavior. The teachers hope the strike will prompt meaningful changes and improvements in student conduct, as many consider leaving the profession due to the challenging environment.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UK-EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as critical negotiating points.

Fishing rights are also contentious, with the EU seeking an extension of current post-Brexit arrangements and UK fishing groups pushing for changes.

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a manhunt and raising concerns about security lapses and potential inside assistance. The inmates created a hole in a cell wall and exited through a loading dock, scaling a wall and crossing an interstate. Authorities believe the escapees, including a convicted murderer, are armed and dangerous, and they suspect that jail workers may have aided in the breakout.

          <p>Tesla has amended its corporate bylaws to require shareholders to hold at least 3% of the company's outstanding shares to initiate a derivative lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty. This change, taking advantage of Texas state law, makes it significantly harder for individual investors to sue the company's board or executives. The move comes after a Delaware court decision rescinded Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package, prompting Tesla to move its incorporation to Texas. The bylaw change is seen as a way to shield Tesla's leadership from shareholder litigation.</p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewelry store in Tokyo can be extradited to Japan following a landmark ruling. Kaine Wright and Joe Chappell are accused of stealing items worth £679,000 from a Harry Winston store in 2015. A judge rejected their challenges against extradition, and the case now goes to the home secretary for a final decision. This would mark the first time Japan has successfully received fugitives from the UK, as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura concluded four days of testimony in the criminal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, stating she would give back her $20 million settlement to undo the "humiliating" drug-fueled sex parties, or "freak-offs." She detailed her sex life with Combs, the physical violence she allegedly endured, and the cover-up efforts by his associates. Combs faces charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, pleading not guilty to all accusations. The defense attempted to portray Ventura as financially motivated, but she maintained she would trade the settlement for a life free of abuse and exploitation.</p>

The remarks followed a four-day tour of the Middle East, where Trump engaged in economic deals with Gulf states and pledged to drop sanctions against Syria.

          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising costs of rolling over existing debt. The rating agency expressed concerns about the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. The downgrade is expected to increase the yield that investors demand to buy U.S. Treasury debt and could dampen sentiment toward U.S. assets. Moody's joins Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings in assigning the U.S. a rating below the highest possible.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit aims to prevent the Los Angeles Zoo from transferring its two surviving elephants, Billy and Tina, to another zoo in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Animal-rights advocates, including Cher, are pushing for the elephants to be moved to an animal sanctuary instead. The decision to move the elephants follows the deaths of two other members of the herd, and zoo officials cite the need to maintain a larger herd size for proper socialization. Critics argue that the move could be detrimental to the elephants' well-being, while zoo officials maintain they are acting in the animals' best interest.</p>
