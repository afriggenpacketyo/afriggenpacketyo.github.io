          <p>President Trump announced via social media that he plans to reveal a major trade agreement with a 'big, and highly respected, country' at a news conference in Washington D.C. The announcement comes after Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, which initially sent markets into turmoil before he paused the hikes for 90 days, except for China. The New York Times and Politico reported that the U.S. will strike a trade agreement with the UK, citing people familiar with the plans.</p>

          <p>Several public transportation services and police departments in Japan are implementing AI-driven systems to streamline lost-and-found operations. Find Inc.'s platform uses AI to categorize lost items from pictures taken by workers, allowing owners to inquire via messaging apps by providing descriptions or similar images. Keio Corp, a railway operator, saw its return rate increase from less than 10 percent to 30 percent after adopting the system. Yurikamome Inc., another train operator, has significantly reduced inquiry numbers, while police departments report faster item returns due to the elimination of physical warehouse verification.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters. The missiles, launched from near Monsanto, traveled approximately 800 kilometers before landing in the sea, with South Korea, the United States, and Japan sharing information on the launches. Experts speculate the launches may have been a test of missile performance for potential export, particularly to Russia for use in the conflict against Ukraine.

Xi expressed confidence that the trip would deepen bilateral cooperation and hailed the friendship between China and Russia, describing them as 'good neighbors,' 'true friends,' and 'good partners.' The visit occurred shortly after local authorities reported downing Ukrainian drones near Moscow, causing temporary airport closures.</p>

          <p>Coal miners in West Virginia have lost access to free black lung screenings due to budget cuts mandated by President Trump at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The screenings have stopped because of President Trump's mandated budget cuts, and a scientist at the NIOSH facility in Morgantown, West Virginia, says her job was eliminated, along with over 200 others, and the Trump administration still plans to terminate all staff in the coming months, leaving the future of the health screenings and other programs in doubt.</p>
