          <h2>Tsunami Advisory Issued for Southern Alaska Following 7.2 Magnitude Earthquake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 18:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of southern Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory. Officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but do not expect large, widespread waves due to the quake's shallow depth. The event occurred in the seismically active "Ring of Fire," with multiple aftershocks reported, though major population centers like Anchorage were not in danger. The situation is being closely monitored by authorities.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry walked through a partially cleared minefield in Angola, continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, who famously did the same 28 years prior. Visiting with the HALO Trust, the same organization his mother worked with, he highlighted the ongoing danger of landmines left from Angola's 27-year civil war. Harry emphasized that the remnants of war still threaten lives daily and called for a world where children can play without fear. The charity has destroyed over 120,000 landmines in Angola since 1994.</p>

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for almost 700,000 Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs from model years 2021-2024 due to a cracked fuel injector that could leak fuel into the engine compartment, posing a significant fire risk. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notice specifies the recall affects vehicles with 1.5L engines. While a permanent fix is being developed, Ford dealers will provide a free interim software update to detect the leak and reduce engine power to prevent a fire.</p>

          <p>An NPR analysis revisits the economic impact of broad tariffs on imports implemented by the Trump administration, questioning when American consumers will feel the financial burden. The report notes that despite fluctuating rates, tariffs have remained high on most imported goods, leading to widespread predictions that these costs would be passed on to consumers. The segment explores the timeline and visibility of these price increases, framing the tariffs as a tax that ultimately affects the wallets of everyday Americans. It reflects on the ongoing debate about the policy's effectiveness versus its cost.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic explores how President Trump's dismissal of the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files as a "hoax" creates a conflict with his political identity. For years, Trump cultivated his base by positioning himself as an outsider telling truths the establishment hides, often promoting conspiracy theories. Now, by demanding trust in the government's official narrative on the Epstein case, he is contradicting his core message. This reversal has angered some of his most ardent supporters, revealing a potential vulnerability in his otherwise strong connection with his base.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump offered a positive assessment of China's efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl, stating that Beijing is "making big steps" on the issue. This marks a shift in tone from his previous stance, where he used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump's comments come amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. He was speaking ahead of signing the HALT Fentanyl Act, a bill that permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as highly controlled drugs under U.S. law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that President Trump's strategy of dismissing the Jeffrey Epstein controversy as a hoax could backfire by alienating his own supporters. Trump's political success is built on being an anti-establishment truth-teller, but he is now asking his base to trust the official government narrative and is attacking those who don't. This approach risks undermining his core appeal and creating a rift with loyalists who have been conditioned to be skeptical of official stories. While most Republican officials remain aligned, the grumbling among his base could pose a future political risk.</p>

          <p>A bill to regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, is gaining momentum in Congress with bipartisan support. The Genius Act, which has already passed the Senate, aims to create consumer protections and establish clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially making stablecoins a more mainstream payment method. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for the digital currency to lose its peg to the underlying asset.</p>
