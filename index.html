          <h2>Russian Officials Dismiss Trump's Ultimatums on Ukraine War and Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 06:03:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russian officials have publicly dismissed President Trump's recent threats of severe tariffs and a 50-day ceasefire deadline as a "theatrical ultimatum." Dmitry Medvedev, a top security official, stated that Russia "didn't care" about the announcement, which included plans to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in new weaponry. Despite the Kremlin's dismissive stance, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed cautious optimism, thanking Trump for the support. The plan, which involves European allies providing Patriot missile systems, has raised questions about its implementation and potential to escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new guidance for relationships, sex, and health education, requiring schools in England to teach students how to recognize and combat misogyny. The curriculum will emphasize identifying positive male role models and understanding topics like incel culture, AI-generated sexual imagery, and the link between pornography and misogyny. Unlike previous proposals, the new rules will not impose strict age limits for specific topics, instead providing a framework for what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school. The move aims to address harmful attitudes and behaviors among boys and young men.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently signed tax-and-spending bill extends President Trump's 2017 tax cuts and introduces significant changes affecting charitable donations and university endowments. The legislation increases the tax rate on endowments for universities with over $750,000, potentially impacting about 15 top research institutions. For individual philanthropy, the bill limits deductions for high-income earners by making the first half-percent of their gross income non-deductible. Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office, estimate these provisions will add over $3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite California Governor Gavin Newsom suspending some environmental regulations to expedite recovery, the rebuilding process in Los Angeles following January's catastrophic wildfires remains sluggish. Fewer than 200 of over 800 rebuilding permits have been approved, as homeowners grapple with high construction costs, labor shortages, and insurance claim disputes. While the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is often blamed for delays, experts argue it's a scapegoat for more complex issues. The situation highlights the tension between the urgent need for housing and the risk of rebuilding in fire-prone areas without improved safety standards.</p>

          <p>Amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and a potential shift in U.S. security commitments under President Trump, France is emerging as a potential leader in Europe's push for "strategic autonomy." President Macron has announced significant increases in defense spending, aiming to double the budget between 2017 and 2027. The country's robust defense industry, which has maintained a "war culture" and expertise since the 1960s, is seen as the backbone of the continent's rearmament. However, France faces challenges, including sourcing raw materials, training specialists, and managing high public debt while funding this expansion.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Angola's capital, Luanda, have been holding mass protests in response to a government decree that significantly raised fuel prices, leading to increased transportation and living costs. The demonstrations, which have been met with a harsh police crackdown resulting in injuries and arrests, reflect broader discontent with the ruling MPLA party, which has been in power for 50 years. Protesters, including students, taxi drivers, and activists, are voicing frustration over economic hardship and what they see as government neglect.

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y SUV at a starting price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries like the U.S. The steep price is largely due to India's 70% tariff on EV imports and a luxury tax, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market competitors. Analysts suggest this is a "soft launch" for Tesla to "test the waters" in the world's third-largest auto market without committing to local manufacturing yet. The company's success may depend on future changes to India's EV policies and import duties.</p>

Dawson's selection comes as a reward for outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His inclusion provides England with a like-for-like replacement and strengthens the lower-order batting, offering a crucial option as England leads the series 2-1.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to facilitate a weapons sale to Ukraine through NATO has drawn sharp criticism from some of his most loyal "Make America Great Again" supporters. Prominent figures like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and former strategist Steve Bannon have argued the move betrays Trump's "America First" promise to end involvement in foreign wars. Greene expressed skepticism that U.S. taxpayers would not bear indirect costs and called it a "backdoor deal." The White House has defended the decision, emphasizing that European allies will pay for the U.S.-made weapons, framing it as a successful outcome of Trump's push for NATO members to increase defense spending.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new scheme offering grants of up to £3,750 to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs). The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible cars costing up to £37,000 and are intended to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the government and some industry figures welcome the move, critics and consumers point to the UK's insufficient charging infrastructure as a major barrier to widespread EV adoption.

The fire continues to pose a threat as authorities struggle to contain it, raising serious questions about fire management strategies in one of the nation's most treasured natural sites.</p>

          <p>The nearly two-decade-long public feud between President Donald Trump and comedian Rosie O'Donnell has intensified after Trump suggested he was considering revoking her U.S. citizenship. The threat came after O'Donnell announced her move to Ireland, citing her opposition to Trump's politics and a desire for a safe environment for her family. O'Donnell responded by calling Trump a "criminal con man" and a "danger to women and children." This latest exchange is the culmination of years of public taunts and jabs that began in 2006 when O'Donnell criticized Trump on "The View."</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump that eliminates federal tax incentives for wind and solar projects is projected to significantly increase electricity prices across the U.S. According to analysis, the absence of these credits will make renewable energy projects more expensive, leading to fewer being built and a greater reliance on more costly natural gas plants. The impact is expected to be most severe in Republican-led states like Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Missouri, which lack their own renewable energy mandates. The move has thrown the renewable energy industry into turmoil, creating uncertainty for future investments and projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "The Dry Season," author Melissa Febos chronicles her decision to take a year-long break from sex and dating at age 35 to reset her relationship with intimacy. Initially planned for three months, the period of celibacy helped her realize how much energy she had devoted to romantic pursuits, which she was able to redirect toward her creative work, friendships, and self-discovery. Febos found that withdrawing from sex made other aspects of life more sensual and helped her develop a more authentic connection with herself. She credits the experience with enabling her to build the healthy, honest long-term partnership she is in today.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are advancing legislation that would exclude noncitizens from the U.S. census data used to allocate congressional seats and Electoral College votes. The 14th Amendment currently mandates counting the "whole number of persons in each state," but several new bills seek to change this for the 2030 census by adding a citizenship question and subtracting noncitizens from apportionment counts. This revives a push from the first Trump administration that faced legal challenges and was blocked by the Supreme Court. Critics warn the move would undermine census accuracy and is a partisan effort to reshape election maps.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American families, like the Algers in Georgia with eight children, are choosing to have babies at home due to a deep distrust of hospitals and medical interventions. This trend coincides with a political push for pronatalism but highlights a disconnect, as advocates say the government isn't doing enough to ensure maternal safety, regardless of birth location. Families cite high maternal mortality rates and a desire for autonomy as reasons for avoiding hospitals, even while acknowledging the statistical risks. The situation has led to a "gray market" for midwives in states like Georgia, where licensing is restrictive.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a breakthrough in EU-China trade relations are diminishing ahead of a key summit in Beijing, which China has unexpectedly shortened from two days to one. The EU's primary complaint is its €400 billion trade deficit, which it attributes to China's protectionist industrial policies, state subsidies, and resulting overproduction of goods like electric vehicles. Meanwhile, China's export curbs on rare earth minerals, crucial for European tech and green industries, have further strained the relationship. With Beijing showing limited willingness to engage, some EU officials are calling for a more assertive stance using tools like the Anti-Coercion Instrument.</p>

While the court acknowledged Germany has an obligation to protect human rights even for foreigners abroad, it concluded there was no clear connection to German state authority in this instance.
