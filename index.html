          <h2>China Addresses Property Sector Concerns with Policy Support</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier Li Qiang's recent statements and escalated policy support signal Beijing's ongoing concerns about the property sector, which has been a drag on China's economic growth and consumption. Analysts believe that while there is no immediate solution, Beijing is increasingly aware of the impact on overall sentiment and domestic demand, especially given the external economic turmoil. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies, enhance implementation synergy, stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks. Specific measures include a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving more land supply and financing aid, ultimately aiming to halt the decline and stabilize the sector. Optimism hinges on the effectiveness of these measures in revitalizing the property market.</p>

          <p>Two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses were victims of targeted shootings, with one representative killed and another senator injured. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, was apprehended after a large manhunt, and is facing charges of second-degree murder and attempted murder. Boelter allegedly impersonated a police officer to gain access to the victims' homes and a list of potential targets, including other politicians and Planned Parenthood locations, was found in his vehicle. The shootings are believed to be politically motivated, with Boelter's writings and social media activity indicating strong ideological views.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to return to pitching, starting against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023, after recovering from right elbow surgery. Ohtani's return was expedited due to injuries in the Dodgers' bullpen, and he is expected to pitch short innings. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts noted Ohtani's eagerness to return to the mound, and Ohtani demonstrated his strong batting form, going 3-for-3 with two runs in a recent game. Meanwhile, rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki's return is uncertain due to a right shoulder impingement, leading the team to plan for the possibility of continuing without him this year.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has firmly stated his determination to proceed with plans to cut the benefits bill, despite potential opposition within the Labour Party.

Starmer emphasized that the current system is not functioning effectively for those who need support or for taxpayers, and he believes that reform is necessary and achievable.

          <p>The family members who operate a formerly Michelin-starred restaurant in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, were arrested for violating the Food Sanitation Act after ignoring an order to temporarily shut down following a food poisoning outbreak. Hirokazu Kitano, his son Hirotoshi Kitano, and his wife Noriko allegedly continued to sell bento boxes despite being ordered to suspend business for two days after 33 customers experienced vomiting and diarrhea linked to norovirus. Authorities later ordered the restaurant to close indefinitely after 23 more people fell ill, and investigations revealed that the business had continued to sell bento boxes during the initial suspension period.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland is set to export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England following a ban on landfilling biodegradable municipal waste, which is scheduled to come into effect at the end of the year. Due to insufficient incinerator capacity, a "capacity gap" of approximately 600,000 tonnes is expected in the first year of the ban. This move raises concerns about increased emissions from transporting waste and the environmental impact of landfilling in England, which also aims to eliminate biodegradable waste from landfills. While the ban intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, recycling rates in Scotland have remained relatively stagnant over the past decade, highlighting challenges in waste management strategies.</p>

          <p>Israel's response to the events following October 7, 2023, including its actions in Gaza and recent attacks on Iran, have damaged its international reputation and escalated regional tensions. The article argues that these actions, driven by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political motives, have stretched the justification for Israel's actions beyond plausibility and broken trust with key allies. By opening a new front with Iran, Israel risks further destabilizing the region and diverting attention from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The author suggests that Israel's campaigns are primarily driven by domestic politics and reputation management, rather than genuine security concerns.</p>

          <p>Analysts are warning that Donald Trump's proposed “revenge tax” could deter foreign investment into the United States. This provision within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would allow the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. individuals and companies. Experts fear that this measure could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe haven status, especially given the significant amount of U.S. assets held by foreigners. Some UK companies might consider moving their stock market listing to New York to avoid the tax, further impacting foreign investment.</p>

          <p>Families are grieving as officials begin handing over the remains of victims from the recent Air India crash in Ahmedabad, India. The process of identifying bodies through DNA matching is slow and harrowing, with officials carefully reconstructing fragments to be placed in coffins. The London-bound Boeing 787 crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. The Indian government has launched a high-level committee to investigate the causes of the crash and formulate procedures to prevent future emergencies, as well as inspecting Air India’s fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to expand deportation efforts in America's largest cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This directive follows a week of anti-ICE protests across the country, some of which have turned violent. Trump stated that ICE officers are to do all in their power to achieve the goal of delivering the largest mass deportation program in history. He accused Democrat-led cities of using undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state, while promising that his administration will focus on the remigration of aliens and preventing the admission of anyone who undermines domestic tranquility.</p>

Some shared owners feel trapped, citing that they have the obligations of renters without the rights of homeowners.

          <p>China's retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and a surge in online shopping. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year on year in May, beating analysts' estimates, as the consumer goods trade-in program and increased foreign tourism contributed to the growth. However, industrial output slowed slightly, and fixed-asset investment underperformed expectations, with a deepening contraction in property investment. While the rise in retail sales is a welcome sign, falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment, requiring stronger policy support to sustain the recovery.</p>

The EU's policies on migration, climate, and civil society are converging with those of Trump, while the concentration of power within the European Commission resembles Putin's authoritarian playbook.
