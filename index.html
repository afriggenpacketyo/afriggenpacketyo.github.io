          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth uncrewed test flight of Starship, achieving orbit but encountering issues after entering its suborbital trajectory. An apparent propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin. Consequently, SpaceX lost control, and the vehicle re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a non-ideal angle, leading to its expected disintegration over the Indian Ocean. Despite the "rapid unscheduled disassembly," SpaceX views the test as a learning opportunity to improve Starship's reliability for future missions aimed at making life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million. The pardon is seen as another instance of Trump using his clemency power to address what he views as the political weaponization of the justice system. The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of financial fraud and tax evasion, with prosecutors arguing their wealth was based on fraudulent schemes. Their lawyer connected their prosecution to that of Fani T. Willis, the Georgia prosecutor who brought an election interference case against Trump.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House, which was heavily supported by President Trump. Musk stated that the bill's high price tag increases the budget deficit, undermining the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The legislation, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," includes extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increased border security spending. Musk, who previously reduced his involvement in government, expressed concern that the bill prioritizes size over fiscal responsibility.</p>

The federation will extend access to the championship meet for more "biological female" athletes. This change comes amid a nationwide debate over the rights of transgender youth in sports, with at least 24 states having laws restricting transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a notable decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The study, involving nearly 200,000 mothers, found a sharp decrease in the percentage rating their mental health as "excellent" and an increase in those reporting "poor" mental health. Factors contributing to this decline may include high housing and childcare costs, rising food prices, and the lack of national paid parental leave. Experts suggest the findings highlight a growing national issue and reassure struggling mothers they are not alone.</p>

These changes come during a challenging period for Six Flags, which posted a net loss of $220 million in the first quarter of the year.</p>

          <p>Nitrous oxide, commonly known as "laughing gas," is gaining traction as a dangerous, yet legal, addiction in America, fueled by the rise of vaping. The euphoric effects of the gas, combined with easy access through vape shops and online retailers, have led to increased misuse and related health issues. The Annual Report of America's Poison Centers saw a 58% increase in intentional exposure to nitrous oxide between 2023-2024. While some states have outlawed recreational use, it remains legal for culinary purposes, creating a loophole that contributes to its misuse and tragic outcomes.</p>

Experts have expressed concerns that this change could impact access to vaccines for these groups, potentially increasing out-of-pocket costs. The decision also puts Kennedy at odds with the FDA, which has emphasized the importance of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy.</p>

This depletion is primarily due to overpumping for agriculture, particularly in Arizona, and is exacerbated by the climate crisis.
