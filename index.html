          <p>My Chemical Romance performed their iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety during a sold-out show at Dodger Stadium. This tour marks a new peak for the influential emo band, who reunited in 2019 and are now playing stadiums for the first time without new music to promote. The concert featured elaborate theatrics, including a satirical narrative involving a fictional dictator, but the article highlights that the enduring power of their music was the main draw. The band also played a selection of other hits and a previously unreleased song, demonstrating their lasting appeal and influence on a new generation of artists.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his status among the sport's greats. Despite heavy rain and having already secured a significant lead, Pogačar displayed his characteristic aggressive style by attacking on the final stage in Paris, ultimately finishing fourth for the stage but winning the overall race by a margin of 4 minutes and 24 seconds. The 26-year-old's victory marks the fifth consecutive year that he and Jonas Vingegaard have finished first and second. This win adds to Pogačar's impressive career, which already includes 21 Tour stage wins and a Giro d'Italia title.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be inducted, headlined the 2025 Baseball Hall of Fame ceremony in Cooperstown. He was joined by six-time All-Star pitcher CC Sabathia and dominant reliever Billy Wagner, who was elected in his final year of eligibility. Suzuki, a 10-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner, fell just one vote short of a unanimous selection, a distinction only held by Mariano Rivera. The induction also posthumously honored Dave Parker and Dick Allen. The event celebrated the significant impact of these players on the sport, with Suzuki's enshrinement coinciding with a new exhibit on the connection between Japanese and American baseball.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a significant increase in Americans seeking second passports through citizenship by investment (CBI) programs, which offer citizenship for a real estate purchase or donation starting around $200,000. Real estate agents and investment migration firms report that political and social instability in the U.S. is a primary driver for the surge. These Caribbean passports provide visa-free access to as many as 150 countries, including the UK and Europe's Schengen area. While the programs are a vital revenue source for the small island nations, they face scrutiny from the EU and U.S. over concerns about security and financial crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a major trade deal, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. This agreement averts a threatened 30% tariff that was set to take effect. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy products and investing $600 billion in the American economy, which includes military equipment. The deal, which stabilizes a €1.4 trillion trade relationship, also establishes zero tariffs for key sectors like aircraft, certain chemicals, and critical raw materials, aiming to bring stability and predictability to both economies.</p>

          <p>Following high-stakes negotiations in Scotland, the U.S. and EU have reached a trade agreement framework, setting a 15% tariff on most EU goods. Both President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the outcome as a significant achievement that provides stability. The deal prevents a potential trade war, as Trump had threatened a 30% tariff rate. In return for the moderated tariff, the EU will significantly increase its investment in the U.S. and boost purchases of American energy, a move intended to rebalance the trade relationship between the two economic powerhouses.</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK, citing growing concerns over imported pets. An investigation found that many dogs from countries like Romania and Ukraine are sold online with minimal vetting, leading to issues with aggressive behavior and the spread of diseases like Brucella canis, which can be transmitted to humans. Owners have reported significant difficulties, with some dogs being described as "ticking time bombs." While many rescuers are well-intentioned, experts warn the lack of proper assessment creates a "Deliveroo for dogs" system that puts animals, owners, and public health at risk.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to provide adequate warning for the catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey in 2023, which killed over 55,000 people. The system should have sent a high-level "Take Action" alert to 10 million people near the epicenter, but only 469 such warnings were issued. Instead, it sent a lower-level "Be Aware" notification to about half a million users, which was insufficient to wake people during the early morning disaster. Citing "limitations to the detection algorithms," Google has since updated its system, which a simulation showed would now correctly issue the 10 million high-level alerts.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential and sharp-witted musical satirist, has passed away at the age of 97. Known for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs in the 1950s and 60s, Lehrer tackled controversial subjects like nuclear war, pollution, and religion with clever piano-driven melodies. After achieving fame, he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his other career as a mathematics professor. His work, which included songs like "The Vatican Rag" and "Pollution," had a profound impact on generations of comedy songwriters and is remembered for its subversive intelligence and ahead-of-its-time commentary.</p>

Martinez-Avila was reportedly driving the wrong way on a highway while intoxicated.

The findings, including Tamil Brahmi script inscriptions said to predate the northern Ashokan script, have become a symbol of Tamil pride and identity. This has fueled tensions between the state and the federal government, with accusations that the national archaeological body is deliberately downplaying the significance of the southern site.</p>

Investigators have not been able to establish a definitive motive for why he targeted the four students, and the murder weapon, believed to be a Ka-Bar knife, has never been recovered.

Rescue operations are ongoing, and many of the injured have been transported to a nearby university hospital for treatment.</p>

          <p>England's players and manager Sarina Wiegman are celebrating their Euro 2025 title, which they secured after a dramatic penalty shootout victory over Spain. Captain Leah Williamson acknowledged that the team "rode their luck" through the knockout stages, which saw all three of their matches go to extra time, but insisted they were deserving champions due to their resilience and fighting spirit. In contrast, Spanish players felt that luck was the deciding factor, stating they had more control and created more chances in the final. The article highlights England's ability to win late in games, with substitutes making a remarkable 10 goal contributions throughout the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Financial Analyst Recommends Buying Honeywell Stock Despite Recent Price Drop</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 18:31:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This financial article analyzes the recent drop in Honeywell's stock price, which occurred despite the company reporting positive earnings and raising its guidance. The author attributes the sell-off to investor impatience with the company's complex, long-term plan to split into three separate entities and a perceived lack of exposure to the booming data center market. Arguing that the market is overlooking the company's strong fundamentals in aerospace and automation, the author expresses strong conviction that the stock is undervalued. The piece concludes that the current discouragement presents a significant buying opportunity for patient investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man, Bradford James Gille, is facing terrorism charges following a mass stabbing at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, that left 11 people injured. The victims, five men and six women aged 21 to 84, were attacked with a folding knife in what investigators believe was a random act. All victims are expected to survive. Authorities stated that the terrorism charge is justified because the attack was intended to instill fear in the entire community. When police arrived, armed citizens were already confronting the suspect in the parking lot, preventing him from causing further harm before he was taken into custody.</p>

          <p>North Korea has dismissed recent peace overtures from South Korea's new liberal President, Lee Jae Myung, calling them a "great miscalculation." In a statement from Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, Pyongyang stated it has no interest in Seoul's proposals for reconciliation. She argued that President Lee's commitment to the South Korea-U.S. security alliance proves he is no different from his hardline predecessor. The rejection comes despite gestures from Seoul, such as suspending anti-North propaganda broadcasts, which Pyongyang dismissed as insignificant reversals of hostile policies that should never have been started.</p>

          <p>The latest attempt to bring Marvel's first family to the big screen, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," has debuted with a strong $118 million at the North American box office. This opening makes it the fourth-largest of the year and the biggest for a Marvel film since last summer's "Deadpool & Wolverine." The film, directed under the supervision of Kevin Feige, also garnered $100 million internationally, for a total global launch of $218 million. Analysts suggest that the success of this film, along with DC's recent "Superman" movie, indicates that audiences are tired of bad movies, not necessarily superhero movies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Greater Bay Area, encompassing Hong Kong, Macau, and cities in Guangdong, is well-positioned to become a global leader in sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already investing in green infrastructure, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system. The author suggests creating a low-carbon tourism corridor that links the region's cities through clean and smart travel options. To achieve this, the article emphasizes that hardware alone is not enough; it must be supported by coordinated policies, industry partnerships, and experiences that cater to the evolving priorities of environmentally conscious travelers.</p>

Harris then engaged in a gunfight with other responding officers before barricading himself inside the home. After about an hour of negotiations, the suspect, who was wounded in the exchange, surrendered to police.
