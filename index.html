          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a retrial in Massachusetts. The jury, after four days of deliberations, convicted Read of driving under the influence of alcohol. The defense argued that Read was framed and that O'Keefe was involved in a fight inside Brian Albert's home, where he was allegedly beaten and left outside. The case has been marked by contentious courtroom battles, allegations of a cover-up, and scrutiny of evidence and law enforcement conduct, leading to a mistrial in the first trial. The timeline of events includes the night of O'Keefe's death in January 2022, Read's arrest, and subsequent legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>The principal of Dundee University and two senior members of its governing body have resigned following a report into a financial collapse that resulted in a £22m government bailout. The report cited poor financial judgement and weak governance as primary causes, noting that nearly £40m of ringfenced money was spent elsewhere. A significant drop in international student recruitment also contributed to an £8m deficit, which was not adequately addressed. The report criticized a lack of openness and challenge within the university's leadership and an overbearing leadership style of the former principal, leading to the crisis. The Scottish government expressed serious concerns about the findings, and the university is working to appoint a new principal.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering military action against Iran's Fordo nuclear site, citing the risk of weapons production, but has not made a final decision. He has been briefed on potential risks and benefits of such a strike and is aware of ongoing diplomatic efforts by the UK, Germany, and France to negotiate with Iran. The president has approved attack plans but is waiting to see if Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. Meanwhile, Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign, raising the stakes of potential escalation.</p>

          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, which could lead to a reduction in monthly benefits by approximately 20%. The updated projection is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act and a surge in early benefit claims. Lawmakers are being urged to take swift action to address the program's financial challenges, with potential solutions including raising revenue by lifting the income cap or adjusting benefit levels. The report also noted that Medicare is facing a financial crunch in 2033, potentially affecting its ability to cover 100% of benefits.</p>

          <p>International calls for restraint are unheeded as tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, with the world bracing for a more intense conflict. President Trump is weighing direct military strikes on Iran, a move that would significantly deepen U.S. involvement. The Kremlin warns that U.S. intervention would trigger a "terrible spiral of escalation," while the U.K. convenes an emergency meeting and withdraws families of embassy staff from Tel Aviv. Diplomacy efforts continue, but chances for de-escalation appear bleak as both sides trade increasingly deadly blows and leaders show no signs of backing down.</p>

United Airlines came in second place, aided by an improved onboard experience, while Southwest Airlines moved up to third due to its low flight cancellation rate.

The new guidance comes after a series of tense visits by Democratic lawmakers to detention centers, with some being turned away, arrested, or manhandled. Critics argue the policy violates federal law and is an attempt to conceal conditions within the facilities. Several lawmakers have condemned the policy, citing concerns about transparency and the treatment of migrants, while DHS defends the changes as necessary for operational and security reasons.</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" strips away traditional war film elements to focus on the existential drama of soldiers during the Civil War. The film emphasizes the minutiae of military life and the characters' inner thoughts over combat, creating a pensive atmosphere. Minervini's naturalistic style and close relationships with the cast result in a series of episodes that subtly pinpoint the economic inequalities, senseless brutality, and thwarted masculinity that have bedeviled the nation for over a century. The film can be considered an origin story for Minervini's exploration of an America still in conflict, rather than a traditional anti-war film.</p>

          <p>Manchester City has been fined over £1 million by the Premier League for repeatedly starting or restarting matches late during the previous season. Nine of City's matches experienced delays, with the longest delay occurring before the second half of the Manchester derby in December 2024. The Premier League stated that City accepted and apologized for the breaches, resulting in fines totaling £1.08 million. This follows a previous fine of £2.09 million for delaying 22 matches, prompting manager Pep Guardiola to pledge shorter team talks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, aiming to end the conflict in eastern DRC over mineral resources. The agreement, initialed by officials from both countries, is set to be signed in Washington, D.C. The deal aims to end fighting and bring American investment into the region, rich in minerals like coltan, cobalt, lithium, copper, and gold. However, critics are skeptical as the M23 militia, a key player in the conflict, is not a signatory, and Rwanda denies formal links with the group.</p>

          <p>The author advocates for increased investment in public pools, citing their importance for mental, physical, and social health. Swimming boosts moods and provides a unique sense of buoyancy and relaxation. Public pools can serve as social hubs, but many have been neglected due to historical racial tensions and the rise of private pools. Revitalizing public pools would promote health, happiness, and community engagement, especially during increasingly hot summers.</p>

          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes from December 2026 to reduce environmental harm, becoming the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The ban, passed in the Senedd, makes it an offence to supply wet wipes containing plastic to customers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business supply. The move is intended to encourage manufacturers, retailers, and consumers to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products. Research has highlighted the significant risk wet wipes pose to the environment, contributing to sewage blockages and river pollution.</p>

The funding pause is part of larger friction between New Zealand, Australia, and smaller Pacific island nations that China is approaching with partnership agreements.

The annual Pride march has been in doubt since Orban announced in February that it would not take place this year, and a law was then passed restricting gatherings if they broke child protection laws on public promotion of homosexuality. Under the new law on gatherings, all those identified by the police as participants using facial recognition software could be fined between £14 and £420.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Iran and Israel escalates, questions arise about the UK's potential involvement. Britain, as America's closest ally, is likely to be affected by the situation. The UK has called for de-escalation, but Israel is unlikely to be listening, as Israel reportedly did not inform it in advance of its attack on Iran, considering it "not a reliable partner". The UK still has a diplomatic role to play, together with its European allies who helped draft the 2015 JCPOA Iran nuclear deal. The UK also has military and strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean.</p>
