            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that security issues would not be discussed in upcoming trade talks with the United States, despite President Trump's calls for Japan to reduce the U.S.'s defense burden. Meanwhile, train services in central Tokyo resumed after a suspension affecting 550,000 people due to track-switching work for improved Haneda airport access. Organizers of the Osaka World Expo are preparing for hot weather and hoping for increased daily visitors to meet the target of 28.2 million attendees, as attendance figures currently range from 40,000 to just under 80,000 on weekdays.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>As the trade war between the US and China escalates, one opinion suggests that China should require bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. Given the impact of Trump's tariff policy, international capital would reassess the risks of operating in the US, signaling to global investors that China's economic fundamentals are strong. This could increase capital inflows to China and outflows from the US.</p>

He reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days, emphasizing that their actions would depend on the actual situation on the ground. Russia's Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of launching attacks in the Donetsk region, resulting in civilian casualties.</p>

            <p>This article discusses how Adolf Hitler's government, from almost the moment he took office as chancellor of Germany, tariffs were at the top of his government’s economic agenda. High on Feder’s agenda for a Hitler economy were tariffs. Even though Hitler’s own foreign minister, Konstantin von Neurath, was concerned that the strategy would spark a trade war, and could drive up the price of imported eggs by 600 percent, Feder’s tariffs fit into Hitler’s larger vision for “liberating” the German people from the shackles of a globalized world order.</p>

It suggests that the US's dependence on Chinese goods is a weakness, not a strength, and that China has been preparing for economic conflict for years. The article explores the potential consequences of a Chinese victory, including a shift in global alliances and emboldened aggression. It concludes that the US could still win if it built a coalition of allies, but that Trump's current approach is counterproductive.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, cautioned against repeating the tariff mistakes of the Great Depression era amid the escalating trade war between the two countries. Drawing on ancient Chinese philosophy, Xie called for joint efforts to grow the global economy rather than fighting over existing spoils. He specifically cited the Smoot-Hawley Act, a protectionist policy that worsened the Great Depression, as a cautionary tale for the current trade dispute.</p>

            <p>New figures indicate a rise in abortion travel in the US, with approximately 155,000 people crossing state lines for abortions in 2024, double the number in 2020. This data comes as the Trump administration effectively dismantled the CDC team responsible for tracking abortion provision in the US, raising concerns about the ability to monitor public health outcomes and assess the impact of abortion bans. While some states have become major hubs for abortion access, researchers emphasize that travel is costly and that many people are still unable to obtain abortions due to bans.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. Economic optimism following his reelection has waned, with more Americans anticipating a worsening economy. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are significantly more negative, and even blue-collar workers show increased disapproval. The public disapproves of tariffs and inflation, with many believing a recession is imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>This article analyzes Vladimir Putin's announcement of a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, questioning whether it represents a genuine step towards ending the war or is simply a public relations move. It notes that Ukraine has expressed skepticism, reporting continued attacks despite the ceasefire, while Russia accuses Ukraine of violations. The article suggests that the truce may be aimed at maintaining good relations with the Trump administration and shifting blame for the conflict onto Ukraine.</p>
