          <p>A 42-year-old man stabbed eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, before being apprehended by authorities. The attack, described as a "brutal act of violence," appeared to be random and occurred near the store's checkout area. Six victims are reported to be in critical condition, with five others in serious condition at a local medical center. Law enforcement, who arrived within minutes, credited citizen involvement in helping to detain the suspect and prevent further injuries during the chaotic incident.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. The victims, aged 7 to 16, were allegedly kept in plywood cages, beaten, and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. Authorities noted that the four adopted children in the home were treated unfairly compared to the biological children and were ordered to lie about the abuse. The investigation began after a legally mandated reporter from a local church raised concerns about the children's welfare.</p>

          <p>A top official in China's Jilin province has called for a more assertive presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, referring to them by their Chinese names. This has reignited a long-standing historical dispute with South Korea, which knows the kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae by their Korean names and considers them part of its own history. The official's comments emphasize a narrative tied to China's "century of humiliation," potentially straining diplomatic ties by reasserting contested historical claims over the region's heritage.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing news coverage of mass casualty events, such as recent incidents where drivers struck pedestrians. Authorities often issue brief, vague statements and scrub more detailed reports and images from the internet, a practice that has intensified since a particularly deadly attack in November. This information control, aimed at preventing copycat crimes and unrest, has led to public pushback online, with citizens demanding transparency. Experts suggest the censorship reflects the Communist Party's broader strategy under Xi Jinping to manage public discourse and prevent local failures from gaining national attention.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly escalates the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation. This development, rooted in a power struggle that derailed Sudan's democratic transition, threatens to fragment the country further and complicate diplomatic efforts to resolve a conflict that has already displaced millions and caused widespread famine.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The prosecution argued the killing was the culmination of a bitter custody battle, while the defense claimed it was self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The trial detailed their turbulent relationship, which included accusations of poisoning, a controversial ballet company, and numerous police reports. Benefield, who was convicted of the lesser charge instead of second-degree murder, faces up to 30 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Emerging scientific research is highlighting the potential long-term health risks associated with nanoplastics, microscopic particles that originate from degrading plastic waste. A University of New Mexico lab has found these particles in human brain tissue for the first time, with higher concentrations observed in the brains of dementia patients. Other long-term studies are tracking the impact on children, linking plastic exposure to issues like hormonal problems, cognitive abnormalities, and cardiovascular disease. Experts suggest the particles themselves can act as "toxic drug delivery systems," emphasizing the need to reduce plastic use.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were stuck inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The incident left the train without power, causing the air conditioning and lights to fail, trapping travelers in the heat and dark. The evacuation was delayed when some passengers reportedly left the train on foot, forcing a power shutdown for safety reasons. All passengers were eventually evacuated through emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus, with two people receiving on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge is heading to the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ulnar collateral ligament injury that could have required a long-term absence. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis after Judge experienced difficulty throwing, prompting him to receive a platelet-rich plasma injection. The team expressed relief that the injury was not worse, and Judge hopes to return in 10 to 14 days, initially serving as a designated hitter while his throwing arm recovers.</p>
