          <p>Newspaper headlines on Tuesday focus on Sir Keir Starmer's new trade deal with the EU, promising economic boosts but facing criticism over fishing rights and youth visas. The article also highlights Donald Trump's phone call with Vladimir Putin, proposing a trade deal in exchange for ending the Ukraine war. Additionally, the UK, France, and Canada jointly condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions in Gaza, citing concerns over aid denial and forced displacement. Starmer's deal is described as an attempt to drag Britain back into the EU by some critics, while others focus on the practical benefits such as faster passport checks and less red tape for businesses.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. CATL's IPO raised $4.6 billion, making it the largest global listing in 2025, and the funds will primarily be used to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition in China, CATL's global expansion faces challenges, including tariffs on Chinese EVs and U.S.-China trade tensions, with the Pentagon placing it on a watchlist over suspected military links.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working long hours to pass President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction package, facing internal divisions and tight deadlines. The House Budget Committee convened late at night to advance the bill, and the Rules Committee scheduled a meeting at 1 a.m. to prepare it for the floor. The late-night sessions are driven by parliamentary procedure and the need to accommodate Democratic input, but also serve to diminish attendance and expedite the process.

          <p>Richard Grenell, appointed by President Trump as the president of the Kennedy Center, accused the center's previous management of "criminal" financial mismanagement, including $26 million in "phantom revenue."

The upcoming season will feature both union and nonunion casts for Broadway shows, a shift touted as providing more options for audiences. Artists have been divided about performing at the center since Mr. Trump became its chairman, with some major performances canceled in protest.</p>

In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the leaders of offering a "huge prize" for Hamas. The joint statement also reiterated support for a ceasefire and a two-state solution, while Netanyahu urged European leaders to follow Trump's vision for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world's largest maker of batteries for electric cars, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were blocked from participating due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. The stock sale, the largest globally this year, raised $4.6 billion but was structured as a Reg S offering to exclude U.S. investors. This move highlights the growing financial decoupling between the two countries, with the U.S. government targeting Chinese companies over national security concerns. Experts suggest this trend may extend to other Chinese hardware and software producers, limiting U.S. investor access to potentially profitable opportunities.</p>

          <p>A fraternity trip to Lake Havasu ended in tragedy when 18-year-old Cal State Fullerton student Simon Daniel drowned in swift-moving waters. Daniel disappeared while swimming in the Copper Canyon area, and his body was found the next morning. The Sigma Pi fraternity described Daniel as "the heart of the fraternity" and said he "brightened every room with his brilliant smile." Recent rainfall had created hazardous swimming conditions, including strong currents, crosswind, and swells, which the group was unaware of. More than 200 students attended a candlelit vigil for Daniel.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization. The study, commissioned by the Environment Ministry, will involve the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Eneos Corp., and others. The research will assess the behavior of seaweed at considerable depths and the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>A report by the Cato Institute found that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had entered the U.S. legally. The report analyzed available immigration data for a portion of the men who were deported to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), challenging the administration's claim that only undocumented people were deported. The report says that 21 men were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, 24 were granted parole, four were resettled as refugees, and one entered the U.S. on a tourist visa.</p>

          <p>China's central bank cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, in an effort to stimulate its economy. The 1-year loan prime rate was reduced to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This decision follows earlier moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce their deposit rates, aiming to protect their net interest margin. Analysts expect further policy easing, with forecasts of additional rate cuts by year-end, supported by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions.</p>
