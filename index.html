          <p>A coalition of UK security agencies, including MI5 and Counter Terrorism Policing, has issued an unprecedented joint warning to parents about the risk of children being radicalized online during the summer holidays. The agencies report an increasing number of children are being exposed to extreme content, including violence and terrorist material, leading to desensitization. The statement urges parents to discuss online safety and use parental controls, noting a deeply concerning rise in terrorism-related arrests among minors.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama's office issued a rare and forceful statement responding to President Donald Trump's accusation of "treason." Trump had claimed Obama led a "coup" against him related to the 2016 Russia investigation, citing a recent intelligence report. Obama's spokesperson called the allegations "outrageous," "bizarre," and a "weak attempt at distraction," affirming that the report does not undercut the established conclusion that Russia interfered in the election. The exchange marks a significant escalation in political rhetoric.</p>
