          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges detailed in an indictment unsealed on Friday. The indictment charges Abrego Garcia with conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia to face the charges after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney asserts that the charges are an abuse of power and that his client will not be convicted. His arraignment is scheduled for June 13.</p>

          <p>Liam Dawson's recent performance highlights what England has been missing, as he returned to the team after two years and six months. Despite being consistently overlooked, Dawson's absence was a topic of discussion among county fans, especially given his leading role as a spinner in the County Championship. England's managing director previously noted Dawson's reluctance to be a reserve player, but now, under captain Harry Brook, his dependable nature is seen as a strength. Dawson's return marks a shift towards valuing consistency and reliability in the team.</p>

          <p>After initially refusing to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the United States, the Trump administration has flown him back from El Salvador to face federal human trafficking charges. This decision comes after the Supreme Court ordered the administration to facilitate his return, addressing constitutional concerns about his due process rights. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that the administration was "playing games with the court all along," and that standard legal procedure involves filing criminal charges before deportation.

The AP filed the lawsuit after being informed it would be excluded from certain areas until it changed its Stylebook to use the name Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico.

          <p>Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman advises that when facing difficulties, engaging in something even more challenging can help break through the slump. Huberman explains that doing something harder deploys dopamine at a higher level, leading to a more effective bounce back. He suggests that this approach, based on the dynamics of dopamine, can help people overcome mental roadblocks. This mindset focuses on taking on anything that's considered "harder," even if the project isn't directly related to the initial challenge.</p>

          <p>Visitors attending the UK-wide Open Farm Sunday event are being warned about the risk of cryptosporidium, a parasitic infection that causes gastrointestinal illness. There were multiple outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis linked to farms in England and Wales in 2024. Inspection reports reveal that some farms repeatedly ignored health inspectors' advice and allowed children to handle sick animals in unsanitary conditions. Organizers of Open Farm Sunday emphasize that participating farms adhere to high health and safety standards.</p>

          <p>Welsh rarebit, a beloved Welsh dish of toasted bread covered in a seasoned cheese sauce, has varied origin stories, with some suggesting it began as a joke by the English. While some believe it was a clever substitute for meat used by poor farmers, others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves associates rarebit with Welsh culture, noting cheese's importance in European diets, especially in Wales. The name "Welsh rarebit" appeared later, with early English cookbooks using terms like "Welsh rabbit" for similar recipes.</p>

          <p>The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) has rejected measures aimed at reducing air pollution by imposing surcharges on gas-powered appliances. The decision followed concerns that the rule would penalize people by raising the cost of household appliances. A U.S. attorney had warned that any action impeding domestic energy resources would face a legal challenge. Environmental advocates argued that the measures were needed to improve air quality, while opponents claimed they would burden low-income residents and stress the electrical grid.</p>
