          <p>A large gorse fire near the Mourne Mountains in County Down, Northern Ireland, is being treated as arson after forcing residents to evacuate. Over 100 firefighters tackled the blaze, which stretched for approximately two miles and threatened nearby properties. Chief Fire Officer Aidan Jennings condemned the deliberate act and praised the dedication of the firefighters. The fire service had received over 700 calls in recent days, prompting a warning for the public to remain vigilant about fire risks, but normal service delivery is being maintained.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel while attempting to visit the West Bank, sparking criticism from Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to spread hate speech, a charge the MPs vehemently denied, stating the trip was organized with UK charities to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand. The incident has ignited a debate about the freedom of parliamentarians to speak truthfully without fear of being targeted. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch supported Israel's right to control its borders, while Labour's Emily Thornberry called the action an insult to Britain and Parliament.</p>

          <h2>Doctor Explains Causes and Remedies for Chronic Throat Clearing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 05:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Laryngologist Dr. Inna Husain explains that chronic throat clearing, a common reflex, can damage vocal cords over time, potentially leading to lesions and voice problems. One cause is laryngeal pharyngeal reflux (LPR), or silent reflux, where stomach contents irritate the throat without heartburn symptoms. Other causes include allergies, sinusitis, vocal cord issues, aging, and certain medications. Recommended remedies include identifying the root cause through an ENT exam, staying hydrated, avoiding irritants like smoking and acidic foods, and practicing alternate behaviors like swallowing or sipping water to allow the throat to heal.</p>

The review challenges myths about the white working class, particularly regarding immigration, noting that age is a more significant predictor of attitudes than class.

          <p>Will Hutton argues that Britain should not be cowed by Trump's tariffs but should instead seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond to create a new global trade order. He criticizes Trump's economics as based on a flawed understanding of trade and advocates for Britain to combine with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to sustain a rules-based, open global trading and financial system. Hutton suggests Mark Carney's leadership in Canada could be pivotal in re-orienting the country around a new global trade order, with Britain playing a key role. He emphasizes the need for Britain to avoid making damaging concessions to secure a deal with Trump and instead focus on building alliances with like-minded nations.</p>

The Shandong appears to have bypassed the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, transiting via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. This new route could give the PLA alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, a strategic chokepoint.

          <p>Donald Trump's 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries, including the UK, has taken effect, triggering a "seismic" shift in global trade.

          <p>China is facing an obesity crisis, with forecasts predicting that over 65% of adults will be overweight or obese by 2030. This has prompted warnings about the increasing pressure on the country's healthcare system due to chronic diseases. The government has launched a three-year plan and introduced "weight management clinics" at hospitals to tackle the problem. Studies show that the number of overweight or obese adults in China has surpassed 400 million and is projected to rise to 630 million by 2050.</p>

Cuban did not expand upon why he sees the sweeping cuts to the federal workforce led by the DOGE office as related to the nation's economic health. He suggested the combination of policies may lead the country to "a far worse situation than 2008."</p>

          <p>Tim Tszyu has restored his reputation and reignited his international career with a brutal beatdown of American Joey Spencer in Newcastle. The referee stopped the fight two minutes and 18 seconds into the fourth round after Australia’s former WBO world champion battered Spencer with a stunning blitz to the head and body. The desperately needed victory was Tszyu’s first in 18 months, following damaging world-title defeats in the US last year to Sebastian Fundora and Bakhram Murtazaliev. The impressive victory set up a likely blockbuster with Keith Thurman after the pair were scheduled to fight in Las Vegas last March, before the American great withdrew with a torn biceps muscle.</p>
