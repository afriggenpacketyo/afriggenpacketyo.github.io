          <p>President Trump has announced that the 2026 Group of 20 (G20) summit will be hosted at his Trump National Doral Miami resort. The White House stated the event would be held "at-cost," with the resort receiving no profit from the U.S. government or foreign delegations. This decision revives a plan from his first term that was abandoned in 2020 due to ethical concerns and criticism over potential conflicts of interest. The G20 is a major economic forum representing the world's largest economies, and the U.S. plans a "back-to-basics" approach for its host year.</p>

          <p>AI startup Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged the company illegally used their copyrighted books to train its AI models. According to the court filing, the settlement includes payments of approximately $3,000 per book and requires Anthropic to destroy the datasets containing the pirated material. This case has been closely watched as a precedent for copyright infringement in the age of artificial intelligence. If approved, it would represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to begin renaming the Department of Defense back to its pre-1940s name, the Department of War. The order allows the agency to immediately start using "Department of War" as a secondary title, with the defense secretary permitted to use the title "Secretary of War." The White House argues the change conveys a stronger message of military readiness and resolve, with Trump calling the current name "woke" and "too defensive." The order directs the department to recommend legislative actions to make the change permanent, though cost concerns have been raised.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, falling drastically short of the 80,000 forecasted by analysts and pushing the unemployment rate to 4.3%. Economists attribute the faltering job market to factors like the Trump administration's tariffs and the rapid corporate adoption of artificial intelligence. The weak hiring data, including downward revisions for previous months, has intensified concerns about potential stagflation and makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September highly probable. This report suggests a significant loss of momentum for the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, a former Alaska Airlines pilot, has pleaded guilty to federal charges of interfering with a flight crew after attempting to disable a passenger plane's engines in October 2023. Emerson, who was off-duty in the cockpit's jump seat, admitted to pulling the fire extinguisher handles, believing he was in a dream and trying to wake up.

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was unlawful. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen prevents the administration from ending the legal protections and work permits for these individuals, barring a successful appeal. The judge's ruling stated that the Department of Homeland Security's action to revoke TPS was unprecedented in its speed and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. This provides temporary relief for the affected migrant communities facing potential deportation.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are remembering Giorgio Armani not just for his iconic designs but as a masterful business leader who built a global empire. Armani was praised for maintaining creative control and brand consistency by never selling his company, allowing him to expand into diverse markets like cosmetics, home furnishings, and even chocolates. His introduction of the softly tailored "power suit" for both men and women in the 1970s and 80s redefined professional attire. Furthermore, his strategy of dressing celebrities for films and red carpet events was a pioneering marketing move that elevated his brand's global prestige.</p>

Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per person annually on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 a year, which may be linked to fewer purchasing opportunities in rural areas.

The legal dispute centers on whether a single committee has the authority to block gubernatorial appointments or if the full General Assembly must vote.

According to FBI data from 2024, Chicago's violent crime rate was down 11% from the previous year and ranked 29th out of 37 large U.S. cities, lower than New York and Los Angeles. While the city recorded the highest total number of homicides, its homicide rate per 100,000 people placed it tenth among major cities. Experts caution against city-by-city rankings due to differing methodologies and geographical boundaries, suggesting that perception is often shaped by concentrated spikes in violence.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. tech companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion this week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. The surge was largely driven by a favorable court ruling in Google's antitrust case, which imposed limited penalties and allowed its lucrative search deal with Apple to continue, boosting both companies' stocks. Another major gainer was Broadcom, whose shares rose after announcing a new $10 billion contract with a major AI client. This growth highlights the increasing market concentration, with these few megacap companies now accounting for approximately 36% of the S&P 500's total value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign, a landmark at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport for 25 years, is being temporarily taken down. The removal is necessary to accommodate a major reconfiguration of the surrounding roadways aimed at improving traffic flow and accessibility. The project is part of a broader modernization effort to prepare the airport for major upcoming events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics. The letters will be stored safely and reinstalled in a new location compatible with the redesigned entrance once construction is complete.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, dropped over 10% following a report that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may link autism to acetaminophen use during pregnancy. The Wall Street Journal reported that a forthcoming HHS study, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is expected to suggest this connection. Kenvue stated that it has continuously evaluated the science and maintains there is no causal link, a position supported by the FDA and leading medical groups. This development reflects Kennedy's focus on investigating potential environmental causes of autism.</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point drop represents the largest one-day decrease in over a year, providing some relief to prospective homebuyers facing high housing prices. For a buyer of a median-priced home, this rate reduction could translate to a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains uncertain whether this decline will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as overall mortgage demand has remained sluggish.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, though the dismissal was based on a technicality and allows for an amended complaint to be filed. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled the suit was an impermissible "shotgun complaint" because multiple counts improperly incorporated all allegations from the first count. Newsmax, which accused Fox News of monopolistic and anticompetitive behavior in the conservative media market, stated it would refile the lawsuit to correct the technical issue. Fox News has characterized the lawsuit as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own competitive failures.</p>

The shake-up includes new appointments to two of the highest offices of state: Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary.

The report also included a major downward revision for June, which now shows a loss of 13,000 jobs—the first monthly decline since 2020. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%, with a widening gap for Black Americans, whose unemployment rate hit 7.5%. This continued slowdown has intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, while the White House has continued to attack the central bank for its policies.</p>

The document outlines a future of "sustainable abundance" driven by AI, with little mention of developing new consumer cars. This pivot comes as Tesla's auto sales have slumped amid growing competition and as CEO Elon Musk's compensation plan is tied to ambitious targets in robotics and autonomy. The plan suggests Tesla, the country's largest EV maker, increasingly sees its future outside of the traditional car manufacturing business.</p>
