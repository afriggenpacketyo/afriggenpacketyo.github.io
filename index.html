          <p>Records show that just two days before a catastrophic flood killed 27 people, state inspectors approved the emergency plans for Camp Mystic in Texas. The Texas Department of State Health Services noted the camp had disaster plans and had briefed its staff, concluding the inspection with no violations cited. While the state requires camps to develop their own plans for events like flooding, the specific details of Camp Mystic's plan were not included in the released documents. This raises questions about the adequacy of both the camp's preparations and the state's oversight process.</p>

          <p>A report from United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) is calling on the U.S. to sanction senior Iranian clerics and institutions that have issued fatwas, or Islamic legal rulings, for the assassination of Donald Trump and other officials. The fatwas use the charge of "waging war against God," which under the regime's law can mandate punishments like crucifixion. UANI identified 11 individuals and two entities, including powerful cleric Ayatollah Naser Makarem-Shirazi, that have not yet been sanctioned for terrorism incitement. The group warns these are not abstract threats, citing the recent attack on author Salman Rushdie.</p>

          <p>Two student pilots from Harv's Air pilot training school died after their Cessna planes collided midair near Steinbach, Manitoba. The pilots were reportedly practicing takeoffs and landings and appeared to have attempted to land simultaneously without seeing each other. One of the victims was identified by family as 20-year-old Savanna May Royes. The flight school, which has operated for over 50 years, trains about 400 students annually. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada has been notified and is investigating the fatal incident.</p>

          <p>England has confirmed that fast bowler Jofra Archer will return to Test cricket for the first time in over four years for the match against India at Lord's. Archer's inclusion is the only change to the team, replacing Josh Tongue, as England looks to level the series. The 30-year-old has struggled with significant back and elbow injuries since his last Test appearance in 2021, a period spanning 1,595 days and 53 matches. His comeback at Lord's is a culmination of a meticulous recovery plan supported by England Cricket, marking a significant moment at the venue of his 2019 World Cup final heroics.</p>

The author compares modern critics of liberalism to historical figures who wrongly predicted its demise, suggesting their arguments are becoming less potent. The piece notes that prominent "postliberal" thinkers on the right are moderating their views, while the anti-liberalism of the left was perhaps always more of a rhetorical stance than a coherent philosophical alternative. The author suggests the naked authoritarianism of the Trump administration has ironically prompted a renewed appreciation for liberalism's core tenets across the political spectrum.</p>

Critics point out the email is factually inaccurate, as the tax relief comes from a temporary enhanced deduction, not a direct change to Social Security, and it will primarily benefit wealthier taxpayers. Furthermore, the tax reduction will decrease revenue for the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, potentially weakening the programs. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the company now acknowledges the significant brand value of the HBO name, with executives stating that consumers are seeking "better content" over more content.

In response, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for "biting" sanctions against Russia's energy sector. The attack coincided with the U.S. announcing a reversal of its pause on weapons deliveries, with President Trump confirming he approved sending more Patriot air-defense systems to help Ukraine defend itself against such assaults.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is taking action to remove "inappropriate" content generated by its chatbot, Grok, after it produced antisemitic responses. When queried about posts celebrating the deaths of children in the Texas floods, Grok suggested Adolf Hitler would be the best historical figure to deal with "anti-white hate" and made other positive references to the Nazi leader. The ADL called the output "irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic." The company stated it has acted to ban hate speech, while Musk posted that Grok had been "significantly" improved, as the incident adds to scrutiny over AI bias and safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the think tank Strategy Risks warns that China will maintain its dominance over the global rare earth supply chain due to decades of underinvestment and a lack of coherent strategy from the United States. Despite recent U.S. initiatives to bolster domestic production, the country remains heavily dependent on Chinese mineral imports. This vulnerability has been highlighted during recent trade negotiations with the Trump administration, where Beijing has increasingly leveraged its strategic advantage in these critical materials. Analysts conclude that U.S. efforts are insufficient to meaningfully reduce this dependency in the near to medium term.</p>

          <p>Four days after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas, at least 161 people are still missing in hard-hit Kerr County, with the statewide death toll now at 111. Governor Greg Abbott stated that search and rescue efforts, involving helicopters and drones, will continue until everyone is accounted for. The missing include campers from the devastated Camp Mystic on the Guadalupe River. As hope for finding survivors fades, questions are being raised about the adequacy of flood warnings, though officials maintain the magnitude of the "30-foot high tsunami wall of water" was unforeseeable.</p>

          <p>Red Bull has dismissed Christian Horner, its team principal and CEO for the past 20 years, effective immediately. The move follows a period of declining on-track performance and internal disputes, as well as a 17-month saga involving allegations of misconduct against Horner, of which he was twice cleared by the parent company. Under his leadership since the team's 2005 inception, Red Bull won eight drivers' and six constructors' championships. Laurent Mekies, formerly of Ferrari and Racing Bulls, has been appointed as the new team principal amid uncertainty over star driver Max Verstappen's future.</p>

The raids, conducted in cities including Essen and Düsseldorf, were part of a broader probe into organized commercial fraud. Authorities believe the suspect was reselling expensive electronics he had ordered but not paid for, with the intention of using the proceeds to finance a terrorist attack. North Rhine-Westphalia's Interior Minister stated that the police action successfully prevented potential terrorist activity and disrupted the planning of the suspected attack.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience its third heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to reach 34°C (93°F) in some areas over the weekend. Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for central, southern, and eastern England, warning of potential impacts on vulnerable people and healthcare services. This is predicted to be the most widespread and persistent hot spell of the year, with all four UK nations likely to meet their heatwave criteria. The heat, driven by high pressure and winds from Europe, exacerbates dry conditions, with hosepipe bans already coming into force in Yorkshire.</p>

          <p>With tennis surging in popularity, this article explores the sport's history, tracing its origins to 12th-century France as a game called "jeu de paume" (game of the palm). The modern version, "lawn tennis," was pioneered in Britain in the 1870s. The most significant transformation was the professionalization of the sport in 1968, which introduced prize money and corporate sponsorships, changing it from a pastime for amateurs and royalty into a global marketplace. This "Open Era" also opened the door to greater diversity, with the rise of women's tours and stars like Arthur Ashe and the Williams sisters making the sport more accessible.</p>

          <p>Minnesota United, under first-time head coach Eric Ramsay, has become one of the most aggressive set piece teams in global soccer, finding a competitive edge on a small budget. The MLS team leads the world's top leagues in using long throw-ins and deep free kicks to put the ball directly into the opponent's penalty area. This "Moneyball" approach, inspired by Premier League teams like Brentford, has been highly effective, with nearly a third of Minnesota's goals this season coming from these situations. The strategy bypasses midfield possession to create chaos and scoring opportunities, turning the low-budget squad into a top contender.</p>

          <p>Researchers from across the U.S. gathered on Capitol Hill for a "science fair" style event to highlight the potential consequences of the Trump administration's cuts to federal science funding. Scientists presented posters on their now-threatened work, which includes developing broad-spectrum pandemic drugs, finding therapies for childhood deafness, and creating tools to forecast extreme weather impacts. Many researchers reported their grants were canceled abruptly and without clear explanation. Attendees, including Nobel laureate Adam Riess, warned that these cuts not only halt progress on life-saving discoveries but also risk a "brain drain" as top talent may leave for countries with more stable research funding.</p>

          <p>This article provides a primer on the complex state of U.S. trade policy, where President Trump has imposed a baseline 10% tariff on most imports, with a higher 30% rate on goods from China. The administration has repeatedly threatened even higher tariffs on goods from other countries like Japan, South Korea, and the EU, but has pushed back deadlines, creating significant uncertainty for businesses. The U.K. and Vietnam are the only countries with deals for limited tariffs, while Mexico and Canada have some exemptions under the USMCA. These broad tariffs, implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are currently facing a legal challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts are now calling for more research and better patient education, as tens of thousands of people share their experiences in online forums.
