          <p>The chief executive of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), Karen Kneller, has resigned following intense criticism over the organization's handling of wrongful conviction cases. Her departure comes after the CCRC admitted to failing Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. The Justice Select Committee had called for her resignation, citing the organization's inability to learn from its mistakes, and advocates are now demanding a completely new leadership team to restore confidence in the crucial justice body.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has significantly curtailed the power of federal district judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block presidential policies. In a 6-3 decision, the conservative majority ruled that judges can generally only halt a policy for the specific plaintiffs in a lawsuit, not for the entire country. Dissenting justices warned that this decision dangerously weakens the judiciary's ability to act as a check on executive overreach and effectively allows the president to enforce unconstitutional policies across most of the nation.</p>

          <p>This first-person article recounts a journalist's decision to get their blood tested for lead after covering the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles. The experience explores the anxiety and confusion that residents face regarding invisible health threats from contaminants released by urban fires, a risk very different from the immediate danger of flames. The account highlights the broader challenge for communities in understanding and navigating the long-term health consequences of environmental disasters, even when initial test results appear reassuring.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly criticized the Trump administration for what he describes as a failure to provide adequate resources for wildfire prevention on federal lands. With California's fire season intensifying, Newsom urged the White House to match the state's investments in forest management, using the slogan "Make America Rake Again" to turn one of Trump's past criticisms back on him. The White House responded by blaming Newsom for state-level funding cuts, continuing the political feud over fire management.</p>
