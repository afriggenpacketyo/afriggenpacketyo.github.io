          <p>Three contract workers have been safely rescued after being trapped for two days in a collapsed copper and gold mine in northern British Columbia. The men, who had access to supplies in an underground refuge chamber, were found to be in good health following the rescue operation. The mine operator, Newmont, has suspended production at the Red Chris mine pending a full investigation into the incident. The rescue was accomplished by clearing the original access tunnel that had been blocked by debris.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 05:39:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are observing a rise in sinkhole occurrences globally, linking the phenomenon to the effects of climate change. Extreme weather patterns, such as prolonged droughts followed by intense rainfall, weaken the ground and can trigger collapses, particularly in areas with soluble bedrock. Experts point to regions like Turkey's Konya Plain, where sinkhole events have dramatically increased alongside falling groundwater levels. While technology like ground-penetrating radar can help detect risks, experts stress that managing groundwater use and implementing better infrastructure are crucial for prevention.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Mexico have signed a memorandum of understanding to combat the decades-long issue of sewage and toxic waste flowing from the Tijuana River into Southern California. The agreement establishes a new timetable and allocates $93 million from Mexico for infrastructure projects through 2027 to address the pollution, which has caused beach closures and health concerns. This accord follows renewed commitment from both nations, with officials highlighting the cooperation of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's new administration. The plan aims to provide a durable, long-term solution to the environmental and public health crisis.</p>

          <p>Doctors and humanitarian organizations in Gaza are reporting a severe and escalating hunger crisis, with a significant rise in deaths from malnutrition, particularly among children. Aid groups like MSF and MercyCorps describe overwhelmed medical facilities, a tripling of severe malnutrition cases in children under five, and families going days without food. While aid organizations warn of mass starvation, the Israeli government denies limiting aid, attributing shortages to Hamas. The dire situation highlights the immense struggle for survival faced by civilians and the challenges in delivering sufficient humanitarian assistance.</p>

          <p>Several Venezuelan men, recently released in a prisoner swap, have alleged they endured severe physical and psychological abuse after being deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's CECOT prison. The men, who were deported under the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties which they deny, claim they were beaten, humiliated, and denied legal access. A DHS spokesperson stated the men were sent to CECOT so they would "no longer pose a threat to the American people," without addressing the abuse allegations. The men have since been returned to Venezuela.</p>

          <p>A panel of doctors has strongly urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its most severe "black box" warning labels from low-dose estrogen treatments for menopause symptoms. Experts argue the current warnings, which list risks like cancer and dementia, are unsupported by science for these localized therapies and unnecessarily scare women away from beneficial medication. The push, championed by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, reflects a significant shift from the medical consensus of the early 2000s. However, some critics view the panel as "theater" and worry it bypasses more rigorous scientific evaluation processes.</p>

          <p>Pediatricians across the U.S. are reporting increased anxiety from parents about future access to routine childhood immunizations, particularly for those on Medicaid. This concern has been fueled by policy shifts under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including the replacement of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee (ACIP). Since ACIP's recommendations determine insurance coverage requirements, any changes could force families to pay out-of-pocket for shots. Doctors are now urging parents to vaccinate their children as soon as they are eligible, fearing that potential coverage gaps could lead to a decline in vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>The founder and CEO of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, Wang Ning, has stated the company's ambition to become a global brand, shifting from its original goal of being "China's Disney" to becoming "the world's Pop Mart." The company has experienced explosive growth in international revenue, largely driven by the popularity of its Labubu dolls, which have gained a following among global celebrities. Wang predicts that overseas sales will likely surpass domestic sales this year, reflecting a broader strategic trend of Chinese consumer companies exporting their own brands and intellectual property.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have signed a free trade agreement (FTA) expected to boost their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually in the long term. The deal, finalized after three years of negotiations, will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and scotch whisky. Under the agreement, 92% of UK exports to India will see reduced or eliminated tariffs, while up to 99% of Indian goods shipped to Britain will become tariff-exempt. Leaders from both nations hailed the pact as a "historic" move for shared prosperity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England is underway, with Health Secretary Wes Streeting promising to minimize disruption to NHS services. In a shift from previous walkouts, NHS England has instructed hospitals to maintain non-urgent services where possible, with senior doctors covering for their striking colleagues. The British Medical Association (BMA) warned this could stretch staff too thin and reiterated that the strike could have been averted if the government had negotiated on pay. The dispute centers on pay restoration, with the BMA claiming pay has fallen by a fifth since 2008.</p>

          <p>Despite its growing popularity, the Tour de France Femmes continues to highlight significant disparities in professional cycling, particularly in prize money and salaries. The female winner of the Tour receives €50,000, just a tenth of the €500,000 awarded to the male champion. While the race director defends the gap by pointing to the men's race being longer, top female cyclists express disappointment. Although a minimum wage has been introduced for top-tier female riders and media coverage is improving, a vast gap remains, underscoring the ongoing fight for equality within the sport.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to immediately recognize a Palestinian state, following France's recent commitment to do so. A report from the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, backed by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, argued that statehood is an "inalienable right" and should not be conditional. While Starmer has called statehood a right, his government's official position is to grant recognition when it can have the "greatest impact." This issue is creating a divide, with Conservative MPs on the committee echoing the government's more cautious, process-driven approach.</p>

A former senior prosecutor and financial researchers claim the schemes persist due to legal loopholes, under-resourced authorities, and intense lobbying from the financial industry. The fraud involves complex share-lending deals around dividend payout dates to claim multiple tax refunds on a single tax payment. Experts argue that until legal loopholes are closed, these schemes will continue.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is holding an unprecedented mass recall vote targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The recall, organized by pro-DPP civic groups, accuses the KMT legislators of being too close to Beijing and "selling out Taiwan." The outcome is seen as a crucial test for the ruling DPP's "resist China, protect Taiwan" campaign and could significantly shape the island's political dynamics. The vote occurs amid heightened military pressure from Beijing, which views the self-governed island as a part of China, making the political stakes exceptionally high for all parties involved.</p>

          <p>This article examines key narratives surrounding the WNBA in 2025, fueled by the arrival of star Caitlin Clark and the league's growth spurt. It assesses the debate over Clark's status, noting that while fans voted her a top All-Star, her on-court effectiveness and player votes place her behind established veterans. The piece argues the league is not overly dependent on Clark, with rising attendance also driven by expansion teams and other young stars. It also pushes back on criticisms about a lack of dunking and suggests that refereeing is a point of contention, but not uniquely problematic.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.9% in June, a rebound driven by a spell of hot weather, according to the Office for National Statistics. The sunshine prompted consumers to buy more fuel as they traveled more, and also increased sales of drinks and summer clothing at supermarkets. However, this rise follows a larger-than-expected 2.8% drop in May, and the overall trend for the second quarter shows that growth in retail spending has lost momentum.

The article suggests England can learn from Germany's semi-final performance by exploiting Spain's high defensive line with connected forward play. A critical challenge will be neutralizing Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot Patri Guijarro and containing Ballon d'Or winners Bonmati and Putellas. While Spain is expected to dominate possession, England may be better suited to a transitional game, but will need to maintain defensive concentration to secure a victory.</p>
