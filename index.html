        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a discussion, President Trump conveyed to Apple CEO Tim Cook his preference for the company to manufacture its products within the United States rather than expanding production in India. Trump referenced Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and expressed his desire for Apple to prioritize domestic production, while also acknowledging the company's previous investments in China. Apple has been increasing its production in India to reduce its reliance on China, aiming to manufacture around 25% of its global iPhones in India over the next few years, as approximately 90% of its smartphones are assembled in China.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. This has become a major obstacle for Republicans attempting to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal that extends President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Some Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California are threatening to vote against the package unless the cap is raised or eliminated. A House committee approved raising the cap to $30,000, but disagreements persist, highlighting the political challenges of balancing tax relief with federal revenue concerns, as voters express frustration over high local taxes.</p>

          <p>Four rock climbers were descending a steep gully in Washington's North Cascades Range when a piton anchor failed, causing them to fall approximately 400 feet. Three of the climbers, Vishnu Irigireddy, Tim Nguyen, and Oleksander Martynenko, died in the fall. Anton Tselykh, the sole survivor, was knocked unconscious and awoke hours later in the dark. Despite head trauma and internal bleeding, Tselykh managed to extricate himself from the ropes, trek to his car, and drive 40 miles to call for help, leading to a search and rescue operation to recover the bodies of his companions.</p>

The fires, including the Jenkins Creek Fire, Camp House Road Fire, and Munger Shaw Fire, have collectively spread across more than 37,000 acres. The Eastern Area Complex Incident Team is managing the Jenkins Creek and Camp House fires as the "Brimson Complex," while the Camp House Road Fire has already destroyed numerous structures.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only about 20% of listed homes in March were affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pricing middle-class households out of the market, with the affordability gap worsening in cities with restrictive zoning regulations. The lack of affordable homes is driving up prices, as buyers compete for limited inventory, impacting careers such as nursing, teaching, and plumbing.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent agreement between the U.S. and China to pause tariff increases, touted by the White House as a “historic win,” validates Beijing’s strategy of resisting “economic bullying.” Diplomatic observers believe the deal, which involves rolling back tariffs on each other’s goods by 115%, provides early insights into dealing with President Trump’s combative approach. However, they caution that the 90-day truce will not prevent long-term confrontations, urging preparations to address persistent sticking points and structural divides in bilateral ties. The reciprocal tariff imposed on Chinese products after April 2 significantly hampered trade between the two nations.</p>

He cautioned that the economy may face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for central banks. While he did not directly mention President Trump's tariffs, Powell acknowledged that tariffs could slow growth and increase inflation, making policy decisions more complex.</p>

          <p>Walmart warned that it may soon be forced to raise prices, even with softer tariffs on China, due to the ongoing impact of President Trump's trade levies. CEO Doug McMillon stated that the company would do its best to keep prices low, but the magnitude of the tariffs makes it difficult to absorb the pressure, given narrow retail margins. The price hikes are expected to take effect later this month, and Walmart has pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty. The company remains cautious as consumers adjust their spending in response to economic volatility.</p>

          <p>Japan is considering expanding the scope of industries eligible for the Specified Skilled Worker visa to address a severe labor shortage. A draft presented to a ruling Liberal Democratic Party committee proposed increasing the number of eligible industries from 16 to 19, newly including warehouse management, waste disposal, and linen supply. The Specified Skilled Worker visa, created in 2019, allows foreigners to work in sectors facing workforce challenges, such as construction, nursing care, and agriculture. As of the end of 2024, there were more than 280,000 holders of this visa, with the No. 2 visa offering a path to permanent residency.</p>

          <p>The UK economy has demonstrated unexpected resilience, with growth figures for the first three months of the year exceeding expectations at 0.7%. While this growth may be influenced by erratic trade war factors and a bounceback from previous stagnation, it signifies a return to healthier economic levels. Despite concerns about the cost of living squeeze and pressures on small businesses, the UK is currently the fastest-growing economy among the G7 nations. The impact of interest rate cuts and relative political stability may have played a more significant role, with real incomes rising and businesses accommodating rising National Insurance contributions through profit margin and wage adjustments.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether federal judges can issue nationwide injunctions blocking Trump administration policies, a practice that has frequently impeded President Trump's agenda. The case stems from an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which was quickly blocked by federal judges. The debate over these injunctions has intensified, with some justices expressing concerns about their scope. A decision limiting nationwide injunctions could significantly alter how federal courts handle challenges to Trump's policies, potentially boosting executive power and requiring opponents to pursue individual claims or class-action lawsuits.</p>

He stressed the importance of maintaining inflation expectations at 2% and highlighted the need to convey the uncertainty surrounding the economy.

This move is seen as prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, as the bird's habitat overlaps with drilling areas. If successful, it would signal that no endangered species is safe, particularly those living where fossil fuels are located, despite the species facing a population crash.</p>
