          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett casts doubt on Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India, arguing it won't significantly reduce costs due to continued reliance on Chinese components and potential trade war impacts. He emphasizes that tariffs and decelerating consumer demand pose bigger challenges for Apple, and carriers are unlikely to absorb tariff costs. Moffett also highlights the backlash against Apple in China, with consumers favoring local competitors. Moffett has had a 'sell' rating on Apple since January 7th. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters perceive President Trump's expansion of executive power as overreaching and express concerns about his agenda.

          <p>Critics argue that President Trump's policies and actions are inadvertently benefiting Vladimir Putin's agenda, citing pressure on Ukraine, potential sanctions relief, and rifts with traditional allies. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine, which involves Russia retaining seized territories and preventing Ukraine from joining NATO, aligns with Moscow's interests. Additionally, Trump's actions on other fronts, such as strained relationships with allies and changes to the U.S. government, are seen as advantageous to Russia.</p>
