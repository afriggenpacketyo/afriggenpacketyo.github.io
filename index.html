          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop since last October and indicating that government stimulus efforts may be insufficient. This data follows other mixed economic signals, including strong retail sales but weaker industrial output. While some economists believe this might reduce the urgency for further stimulus, others caution that growth could soften in the second half of the year due to deflationary pressures and trade tensions.

          <p>A large and exceptionally bright meteor, known as a fireball, was witnessed across the southeastern U.S. during daylight hours on Thursday. According to NASA, the space rock was about three feet in diameter and weighed over a ton before it exploded 27 miles above Georgia. The explosion released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT, creating a pressure wave that resulted in sonic booms heard by many residents in the area.</p>
