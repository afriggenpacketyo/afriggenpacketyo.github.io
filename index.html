          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, it remained stranded in Earth orbit for 53 years and is now predicted to return on Friday or Saturday. Experts believe the spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, has a good chance of surviving its re-entry and potentially reaching the surface partly intact. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit is between 52 degrees north and south latitude, posing a low risk of injuries on the ground.</p>

          <p>A recent terrorist attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, resulting in 26 deaths, has triggered a military conflict between India and Pakistan, highlighting a dangerous shift in their rivalry. India, now a geopolitical and economic powerhouse under Prime Minister Modi, views Pakistan as a threat to its rise, while Pakistan, facing economic and security crises, is unwilling to back down on issues like Kashmir. The traditional equilibrium maintained by Indian restraint has changed, with India now pursuing a strategy of international isolation and covert operations against Pakistan, leading to escalating tensions and the erosion of crucial guardrails that once prevented conflicts from spiraling. The article suggests that the United States and global partners should intervene to de-escalate the situation and prevent a potential nuclear catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A new study by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in China raises concerns about the vulnerability of Chinese nuclear power plants during wartime. With China rapidly expanding its nuclear power infrastructure, the PLA warns that these reactors could become targets, leading to catastrophic consequences. The study, prompted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, urges enhanced defenses and emergency response strategies to protect these facilities. The project argues that nuclear plants would inevitably become high-value targets for adversaries in war, armed conflict or terrorist attacks, posing grave threats to lives and property.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., to discuss city priorities and thank the president for his past support during his federal corruption case. Documents related to Adams's case were released, revealing an F.B.I. investigation into witness tampering, though he was never charged. The Justice Department's decision to drop the case against Adams led to resignations within the department. The meeting occurred amidst sensitive issues between the city and the Trump administration, drawing criticism from mayoral candidates who view Adams's relationship with Trump as detrimental to New York City.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled potential openness to lowering tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. He emphasized that China should open its markets to the U.S., noting that "closed markets don't work anymore." The upcoming talks are the first publicly announced meeting since the trade war began, with investors closely watching for a resolution to reduce market volatility. Analysts suggest that tariffs may ultimately settle around 34% as both sides show openness to de-escalation and negotiation.</p>

The quarantine, running through October 31, warns against eating sport-harvested mussels off the West Coast due to the risk of paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. These toxins occur during algae blooms and accumulate in shellfish, with no known antidotes for the poisoning. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine, as they undergo frequent testing.</p>
