            <p>A plane carrying six individuals crashed in an open field near Copake, New York, resulting in fatalities. The NTSB is leading the investigation into the cause of the crash, noting that the aircraft was intact before a high-speed descent. Air traffic control attempted to contact the pilot after a low altitude alert, but received no response and there was no distress call. The passengers were family members and partners traveling for a holiday celebration, making this tragedy particularly poignant. </p>

            <p>Amidst stock market panic and treasury bond yield surges, experts recommend a bond ladder strategy for investors seeking stable income. This involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, providing regular income through principal and interest. An ETF like the LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers a similar approach, investing in treasuries with a fixed monthly income distribution. While no strategy is without risk, experts suggest that a bond ladder can offer peace of mind during volatile times, and protect against buying power erosion. (not investment advice)</p>

The DOJ argues that the requests by Abrego Garcia's attorneys involve interactions with a foreign sovereign and potential violations of that sovereignty. The DOJ's filing underscores the complexities of navigating international law and sovereignty in immigration cases.</p>

            <p>Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies, argues that China's military-industrial complex is reshaping geopolitics. Countries worldwide are increasing defense budgets and pursuing economic security to strengthen defense-critical industries. The global military-industrial complex is tightening its grip on geopolitics, with more than 110 armed conflicts underway. China, like other countries, is adapting to this shift by investing in defense technologies and challenging established spheres of influence.</p>
