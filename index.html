            <p>President Trump has implemented significant tariffs against numerous U.S. trading partners, including a substantial 104% tariff rate on China, effective Wednesday. Trump defends these tariffs as a necessary correction to trade imbalances that have persisted for decades, asserting that the U.S. has been economically disadvantaged. He believes the tariffs will incentivize countries to negotiate favorable trade deals with the U.S., ultimately boosting the American economy. However, the announcement of these tariffs has already led to considerable losses in the stock market, indicating investor concerns about potential economic repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The small country of Liechtenstein is facing significant economic challenges after President Trump imposed a 37% tariff on its exports to the U.S., nearly double the rate applied to its European neighbors. This tariff, affecting Liechtenstein's power tools, cables, connectors, and dental products, is seen as a punishment for the country's trade surplus with the U.S. Locals express confusion and concern, with some fearing the unpredictable nature of Trump's trade policies more than the COVID-19 pandemic. The tariffs are causing a crisis in Liechtenstein, creating uncertainty and anxiety about the future of its trade relations. </p>

            <p>Influential Chinese commentators suggest China may consider targeting the U.S. services sector in response to increased tariffs imposed by Washington. This could involve restricting U.S. firms from government procurement processes or limiting cooperation between Chinese companies and U.S. law firms and consultancies. Other potential countermeasures include increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, suspending cooperation on fentanyl control, and investigating US companies in China over intellectual property issues. These measures aim to counter U.S. trade pressure and address the trade imbalance in the services sector.</p>

            <p>Cambodia faces an existential crisis for its manufacturing sector due to a 49% tariff imposed by the Trump administration.

The Cambodian government is exploring fiscal policies to mitigate the impact, but uncertainty prevails as companies pause new orders.

The move has drawn criticism from environmental groups, who argue that it will harm border communities and ecosystems. The construction is part of a larger effort to build an uninterrupted border barrier, with the goal of completing about 1,400 miles.</p>

Despite a court order for his return, the Trump administration argues it cannot compel El Salvador to release him. Immigration experts say this case could undermine due process for immigrants, as the administration's stance could allow for arbitrary deportations. Lawyers argue that the US has the power to facilitate Garcia's return, given its financial agreement with El Salvador to house prisoners.</p>
