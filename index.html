          <p>French police rescued the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur in a nighttime raid after he was taken hostage for ransom. The man was kidnapped in Paris, and the police located him in a house south of Paris. Five people were detained, and the police are investigating possible criminal charges, including kidnapping with torture. This incident follows a similar case in January, where a co-founder of a French crypto-wallet firm was also kidnapped with his wife.</p>

          <p>Amid rising mortgage rates and a sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds, concerns are growing that China may retaliate against U.S. tariffs by selling off its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Such a move could drive up mortgage rates and negatively impact US homeowners. While Chinese officials have stated they have no immediate plans to radically alter their foreign reserves, the possibility of future actions remains a concern. Foreign countries hold a significant portion of U.S. mortgage-backed securities, making the market vulnerable to large-scale sell-offs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of US arts organizations have received notices that their government grants have been terminated, following President Trump's proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The NEA is updating its grant-making policy to focus funding on projects that "reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the president." These changes come after both the NEH and NEA moved to cut costs and staffing in compliance with earlier directives to reduce the federal workforce and shut down diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Democrats and arts unions condemned the cuts, saying they would be disastrous for public access to creative expression.</p>

          <p>Victims of sexual assault gangs have criticized Labour minister Lucy Powell for describing the issue as a "dog whistle." Sarah Wilson, a survivor of sexual abuse, said Powell's comment dismissed the experiences of abuse survivors. Powell's remarks came during a radio program, where she interrupted a discussion about grooming gangs. The controversy has reignited calls for a statutory inquiry into historical sexual abuse cases. Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, said Powell would continue in her role and that she felt “mortified”.</p>

          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a major relationship killer. This comparison, the psychologist argues, communicates that a partner is not enough and someone else could do a better job. Over time, this type of comparison can lead to insecurity and questioning of one's worth. The psychologist suggests that this phrase is often a symptom of a deeper issue: a fear of openly communicating needs and frustrations within the relationship.</p>
