          <p>A Scottish archivist spent 30 years uncovering the theft of thousands of historical documents by a professor who had a particular interest in stamps.  The professor, David Stirling Macmillan, removed items from the National Records of Scotland between 1949 and 1980, and many ended up in Canadian archives.  The scale of the theft is unprecedented, and the documents are now being painstakingly returned to their rightful places.</p>

          <p>The Golden State Warriors, despite their aging core, are experiencing a resurgence, fueled by the trade of Andrew Wiggins for Jimmy Butler.  While Butler's shooting has been inconsistent, his defense has significantly improved the team's performance.
