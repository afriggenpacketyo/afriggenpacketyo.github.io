          <p>The Sunday Times Rich List 2025 reveals a decrease in the number of UK billionaires, attributed to criticism of tax changes implemented by the new Labour government, while King Charles' personal wealth has increased significantly. The number of billionaires in the UK has fallen from 165 to 156, marking the sharpest decline in the list's history, with concerns raised about the impact of tax changes on both homegrown and overseas entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, King Charles' wealth grew by ¬£30 million to ¬£640 million, elevating his rank to 258 alongside Rishi Sunak and his wife. The Hinduja family remains at the top of the list with a fortune exceeding ¬£35 billion. </p>

          <p>Former F.B.I.

Comey later took down the post, explaining that he was unaware of the violent connotations associated with those numbers. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserted that Comey had called for the president's assassination, prompting an investigation by D.H.S. and the Secret Service, while F.B.I.

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a political crisis as far-right candidate George Simion is likely to become the country's next president, following a comprehensive win in the first round of elections. The article argues that Simion's rise is rooted in decades of economic failure, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, which have fueled anti-establishment anger. The author criticizes both Simion and his opponent, Nicusor Dan, for failing to address the country's broken economic model and socioeconomic injustices. The author warns that Simion's policies, which include cutting welfare benefits and catering to the domestic business class, are unlikely to improve the lives of poor Romanians, drawing parallels to Viktor Orban's Hungary.</p>

          <p>The Scotland women's cricket team, named team of the year in December 2024, faces an uncertain future due to a lack of scheduled fixtures and financial constraints. Despite their recent World Cup appearance, the team has not played at home since 2023 and struggles to secure funding for hosting matches, with costs ranging from ¬£75,000 to ¬£100,000 per series. This situation has left players frustrated, as they lack opportunities for development and feel helpless without adequate financial support. Cricket Scotland receives approximately ¬£1.3m annually from the ICC, but the board has reportedly never made a profit, making it difficult to sustain the women's program.</p>

          <p>Japan witnessed record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, driven by investors seeking refuge from U.S. markets amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows since 1996. The shift was largely driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers, who aggressively bought equities, while bond purchases were fueled by reserve managers, life insurers, and pension funds. As the U.S. softens its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, potentially impacting the future appeal of Japanese assets.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, due to the state's strict abortion ban, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected. The family is upset that Georgia's law doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support. Doctors have told the family that they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected ‚Äî generally around six weeks into pregnancy. The situation raises complex ethical and legal questions about fetal rights, personhood, and the rights of families to make medical decisions for incapacitated loved ones.</p>

While acknowledging Dubai's imperfections, Tice argues that politicians are neglecting valuable lessons from countries that are "getting it right."

          <p>Japan has enacted a law allowing preemptive acts of cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law mandates key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches to the government. The government aims to be fully operational with these measures by 2027, reflecting its ambition to enhance cybersecurity capabilities to levels comparable to the United States and major European nations. An independent panel will be established to provide prior approval for data acquisition, analysis, and actions to neutralize hostile servers, while specific provisions in the law aim to uphold personal rights.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted for the first time in a year, shrinking by 0.2% in the March quarter due to a sharp decline in exports, according to preliminary government data. The contraction was more significant than economists had anticipated, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. However, domestic demand provided a positive offset, growing by 0.6% and contributing 0.7 percentage points to the GDP. Despite the weak yen providing a competitive advantage, Japan's exports were overshadowed by China's machinery and tool exports. While improvements in jobs and wages are expected to support a moderate economic recovery, risks remain in consumer sentiment and consumption due to sustained price hikes.</p>

Her attorney argues that she is eligible for U.S. residency due to her long-term residence and the hardship her deportation would cause her U.S. citizen children. This case reflects an enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which has historically been rarely enforced.</p>

The union said its members will start picketing at 4 a.m. on Friday, while NJ Transit‚Äôs statewide bus system continued to operate as scheduled.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting and deleting an Instagram photo featuring seashells arranged to spell "86 47", which some interpreted as a threat to President Trump. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has stated that Comey "just called for the assassination" of Mr. Trump and that her agency and the Secret Service are investigating the matter. While Comey has said he didn't realize the numbers were associated with violence and opposes violence of any kind, the post has drawn strong criticism from the Trump administration. The Secret Service has confirmed they are taking the matter seriously and are investigating any potential threats against their protectees.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are on strike as of 12:01 a.m. Friday, halting train service and inconveniencing over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike is the result of failed negotiations between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) over pay raises. NJ Transit has suggested people work from home if possible and has implemented a contingency plan that includes additional bus service. The agency warns the plan can only handle about 20% of daily train riders, but commuters can also take Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, light rail, or ferry service. The strike also impacts concertgoers heading to MetLife Stadium for the Shakira concert Friday night.</p>

          <p>During the Karen Read murder trial, a medical examiner testified that John O'Keefe's cause of death was a head injury and hypothermia, but the manner of death remained undetermined. The medical examiner found multiple skull fractures and brain bleeding, with a body temperature of 80.1 degrees upon arrival at the hospital. While the defense argued that the injuries were consistent with a fall on frozen ground, the medical examiner also noted the absence of grass on the back of O'Keefe's head. The defense also questioned the hypothermia finding, suggesting internal injuries could have been caused by factors other than freezing temperatures.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a ‚Äúshock absorber‚Äù of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances. While the climbdown in superpower tensions following talks in Geneva has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs, economists say that Europe will face a bleak outlook if it fails to quickly adapt to Washington‚Äôs efforts to reorder trade with China and the rest of the world. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.</p>

The struggling company, which employs thousands of people in the UK, said it could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally." Nissan's latest job cuts came on top of 9,000 layoffs announced in November as it faces weak sales in key markets such as the US and China. This week, Nissan also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.6bn; ¬£3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the struggling firm.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their political views, a practice known as venue shopping. Conservatives suing the Biden administration often file cases in small Texas courts with Republican appointees, ensuring initial rulings align with their views. Similarly, liberals challenging the Trump administration have favored courts in the 9th and 1st Circuits, known for their liberal leanings. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single judge should have the power to issue nationwide injunctions, potentially limiting the impact of venue shopping.</p>

The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include 'to reject' or 'to get rid of', according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which also notes that it has more recently been used as a term meaning 'to kill'.
