          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released more than 33,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, provided by the Department of Justice following a subpoena. While the committee chair vows to expand the investigation for transparency and accountability, some Democratic members have noted that the vast majority of these files were already in the public domain. The release follows a meeting between committee members and Epstein's victims, with the chair promising to pursue new witness testimony. This development occurs amid ongoing public and political pressure to reveal more information about Epstein's network and activities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a market decline where major indexes fell, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain confidence in the strong companies they own for long-term gains. He attributed the drop to seasonal profit-taking in September by large institutions, particularly in leading tech stocks, rather than fundamental issues with the companies themselves. Cramer also cited investor concerns over a recent court ruling on tariffs and the upcoming labor report as contributing factors to market anxiety. He recommended holding onto Big Tech growth stocks, suggesting they are resilient enough to weather such pullbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The election of Zack Polanski as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales signals a significant shift in the UK's political landscape, particularly for the left. His blunt, digitally-savvy communication style presents a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other left-wing figures and independents. Polanski's victory raises questions about the Green Party's future direction and whether it will focus on deepening its urban, left-wing support at the risk of alienating more moderate, rural voters. The development could lead to either collaboration or competition among the various factions on the British left.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B of assault and battery in a civil trial. The lawsuit was filed by a security guard who alleged the rapper attacked her with a fingernail and spat on her outside a medical office in 2018, seeking $24 million in damages. Cardi B admitted to a heated verbal exchange but denied any physical contact, a claim supported by testimony from her doctor's receptionist. The jury deliberated for about an hour before finding in favor of the musician, concluding a trial that had generated significant public attention.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has maintained a lower court's injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. The ruling allows the Biden-appointed commissioner to continue her work, affirming that the president's attempt to remove her without cause was inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. The case is a significant test of a president's authority to remove members of independent federal agencies.

          <p>Film director Woody Allen described President Donald Trump as "polite" and "a pleasure to work with" as an actor during an appearance on Bill Maher's "Club Random" podcast. Allen, who cast Trump in a 1998 film, stated he was surprised Trump entered politics but found him professional on set, comments which Trump later shared on social media. The article critiques both Allen and Maher for what it describes as normalizing Trump's controversial presidency, contrasting their remarks with the administration's actions. Allen did clarify that he disagrees with nearly all of Trump's political policies and voted for Kamala Harris.</p>

Prosecutors allege Bolsonaro was part of an "armed criminal association," and if convicted, he could face a prison sentence of over 40 years.

          <p>President Donald Trump has recently claimed to have ended six or seven wars, suggesting he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for these efforts. A White House official listed conflicts involving Israel-Iran, Rwanda-DRC, and India-Pakistan, among others, as evidence. However, foreign policy experts interviewed for this article state that while the administration has helped broker some ceasefires, many of these situations were not full-scale wars and several conflicts remain unresolved. For example, tensions between Israel and Iran persist, and violence has continued in the Democratic Republic of Congo despite a peace deal, suggesting the president's declarations of success may be premature.</p>

The article argues that his arrest is symptomatic of overly broad hate speech laws that are selectively enforced, creating a chilling effect on expression.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a "kinetic strike" in the Caribbean Sea, killing 11 people aboard a vessel he claimed was transporting illegal narcotics from Venezuela. The operation comes amid heightened tensions, as the U.S. recently deployed warships to the region for what it terms a counter-narcotics mission, which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro views as a threat. The administration accuses Maduro of leading a drug cartel and has sanctioned him, though some experts are skeptical that a full military intervention is planned. This strike is seen by some as a signal to factions within Venezuela and a political move for Trump's base.</p>

The ruling mandates that Google cannot have exclusive default search engine contracts but will not be barred from paying partners to preload its products.

This situation reflects broader challenges in the downtown office market, which is grappling with high vacancy rates due to the rise of remote work and elevated interest rates making refinancing difficult.

He warns that these troops are not trained for de-escalating urban crises involving mental illness or homelessness, creating a high risk of tragic miscalculations.

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The ban would apply to all retail points, including shops, cafes, vending machines, and online sales, addressing concerns from parents and health experts about the drinks' impact on children's health. Popular drinks can contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee, and excessive consumption in young people is linked to headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. The proposal, which has entered a 12-week consultation period, aims to formalize a voluntary ban already adopted by most major supermarkets.</p>

          <p>Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington, D.C. lawyer, is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in her lawsuit to block President Donald Trump from firing her. Known for representing high-profile clients from both political parties, including Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner, Lowell has a long history of challenging what he describes as federal government overreach. In Cook's case, he is at the forefront of a legal battle over the president's authority to remove a Fed governor, a move unprecedented in U.S. history. Lowell argues the administration is weaponizing the Justice Department for political retribution, a theme consistent with his defense of other clients targeted by the administration.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed federal charges against a tow truck driver for allegedly stealing a government vehicle during the arrest of a TikTok influencer in Los Angeles. The driver, Bobby Nunez, is accused of hooking up and driving away with an agent's car while officers were arresting Tatiana Mafla-Martinez on immigration-related suspicions. The arrest of Martinez, who was livestreaming at the time, went viral and drew criticism for the agents' tactics. Authorities allege Nunez interfered with the arrest and was seen laughing and recording an officer who chased him on foot, leading to a charge of theft of government property.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a federal judge has ordered Google to implement significant changes to its business practices but stopped short of breaking up the company. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google must end its exclusive contracts that make it the default search engine on many devices and must also share some search data with competitors. However, the judge rejected the Department of Justice's more severe proposal to force Google to sell its popular Chrome web browser, deeming the measure a "poor fit for this case." The decision aims to increase competition in the search market while avoiding what the judge called a "messy and highly risky" divestiture.</p>

          <p>Authorities have released a 699-page document containing evidence photos from the apartment of Bryan Kohberger, who was convicted for the murder of four University of Idaho students. The images provide a glimpse into his life, showing academic materials alongside personal items, including two birthday cards he received just over a week after the November 2022 killings. One card appears to be from his parents, while another contains a humorous, annotated illustration of Theodore Roosevelt riding a dinosaur. Kohberger was a Ph.D. student in criminology at nearby Washington State University at the time of the murders and was later sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted a hold on a contract that will provide U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with access to Graphite, a sophisticated spyware tool capable of hacking into mobile phones and encrypted apps. The spyware, developed by the Israeli-founded company Paragon, gives users the ability to track locations, read messages, and access data on targeted devices. Civil liberties groups have expressed alarm, as the powerful surveillance technology is now in the hands of an agency frequently accused of due process violations.

In an open letter, they condemned his policies, such as restricting vaccine access, cutting research funding, and firing thousands of healthcare workers, including the recent removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez. Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, defended his actions by stating the CDC had lost public trust due to "politicized science" and needed reform.

          <p>U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff have formally requested that the Department of Defense provide a detailed breakdown of the recent deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles. In a letter to the Defense Secretary, the California Democrats are seeking specifics on the missions, costs, and any law enforcement activities undertaken by the troops, who were sent over the objections of state and local officials. The request comes as a federal judge ruled the deployment likely violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The senators argue the deployments were inappropriate and harmful to public trust.</p>
