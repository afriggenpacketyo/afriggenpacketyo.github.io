          <p>Catastrophic flooding across Central Texas has had a severe impact on the region's agricultural sector, destroying crops, washing away equipment, and killing livestock. Farmers and ranchers are now assessing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and facing a difficult cleanup and recovery process. The article highlights the particular vulnerability of smaller, specialized farms and agritourism businesses, which often lack the insurance or resources to withstand such extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Butler," veteran political reporter Salena Zito analyzes what she believes the media misses about Donald Trump's political appeal. Drawing from her experience, including being present at the 2024 assassination attempt, Zito argues that Trump connects with voters through a unique authenticity and focus on Americanism. She observes that his rallies attract an enthusiastic and patriotic community, including many young people, who feel seen by his approach.</p>

          <p>Virginia has fallen from first to fourth place in CNBC's annual 'Top States for Business' ranking, its lowest position since 2018. The primary cause for the decline is a weakening state economy, heavily impacted by the Trump administration's plans to slash the federal workforce. With a significant portion of its population employed by the federal government or its contractors, the state is forecast to lose tens of thousands of jobs, raising concerns about its economic resilience.</p>

          <p>According to CDC data, emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. are at their highest point in six years, with a notable spike in the Northeast. Experts attribute this rise to larger tick populations and extended seasons driven by a warming climate, which allows the insects to be active for more of the year. Health officials are concerned about the corresponding increase in tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease and are urging the public to take preventive measures.</p>

By delaying claims until age 70, beneficiaries can increase their monthly payments by up to 77% compared to claiming at 62. To make this feasible, individuals can use other assets, like investment portfolios or annuities, to fund their living expenses during the interim years, thereby managing longevity risk and securing a higher, inflation-protected income stream for life.

          <p>Rupert Lowe, an independent Member of Parliament, is the subject of an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The inquiry is reportedly focused on his alleged failure to properly declare over £600,000 in donations raised through a Crowdfunder for his private "Rape Gang Inquiry." Lowe maintains his innocence, stating that he has followed all parliamentary rules, which provide a 28-day window for registration after funds are received, and has demonstrated his compliance to the commissioner.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study analyzing 23 years of data has found that emergency vaccination programs for five major diseases, including Ebola and measles, reduced both deaths and infections by approximately 60%. The research, which covered 210 outbreaks in 49 countries, also calculated an economic benefit of $32 billion from averting wider health crises and lost productivity. These findings highlight the critical, life-saving value of rapid and effective vaccine deployment in response to outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Denim giant Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after delivering second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company's growth was driven by a strong performance in its direct-to-consumer channels and a 14% increase in its women's apparel category. While Levi's is working to absorb costs from new tariffs, its positive outlook reflects confidence in the resilience of its brand and consumer demand.</p>

          <p>A new CDC analysis estimates that nearly one in three U.S. adolescents had prediabetes in 2023, a condition that increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. However, some health experts are raising concerns about the finding, as the agency changed its methodology and released only a brief summary without a full, peer-reviewed paper.

          <p>An analytical article explores why the United States has not developed a sustained, mass political movement for childcare reform, despite the issue causing immense financial and logistical stress for a majority of families. The author points to a combination of historical factors, including a cultural view of childcare as a private family matter, and a lack of political salience compared to other issues. However, the piece notes that a recent increase in parent-led advocacy groups could signal a potential shift.</p>
