          <p>A 25-year-old man from New York, visiting Puerto Rico for a Bad Bunny concert, was fatally shot at a nightspot in La Perla, San Juan. Police state the victim, Kevin Mares, was an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire of an argument between other individuals. Two other local men were also injured in the incident, which highlights ongoing safety concerns in the historically volatile neighborhood despite its recent rise in tourism. The investigation is in its early stages, and authorities have not yet established a definitive motive for the shooting.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major European leaders has issued a joint statement asserting that any peace negotiations concerning the war in Ukraine must directly involve Kyiv. This comes as President Trump prepares for a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, a summit that currently does not include Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. While welcoming efforts to end the conflict, the European leaders stressed that Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected, with the current line of contact serving as the starting point for talks. The White House has indicated openness to a three-way meeting, but Putin reportedly requested the one-on-one format.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose won his first PGA Tour title in over two years, defeating American JJ Spaun in a three-hole sudden-death play-off at the St Jude Championship. Rose clinched the victory with a birdie on the third extra hole after both players matched scores on the first two. The win was a significant moment for the 45-year-old, who had a mixed final round before a late surge of four straight birdies forced the play-off. Meanwhile, England's Tommy Fleetwood, who held the lead entering the final round, finished tied for third, extending his long wait for a maiden PGA Tour victory.</p>

          <p>Bobby Whitlock, the influential singer-songwriter and keyboardist who co-founded the rock band Derek and the Dominos with Eric Clapton, has died at age 77 from cancer.

His wife, Coco Carmel Whitlock, and former bandmate Eric Clapton were among those who paid tribute to his legacy.

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old man who was reportedly fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. The incident resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, and the suspect also died at the scene. White, who was heavily armed, had previously told his father and a neighbor he believed the vaccine was harmful. The attack has prompted a union representing CDC workers to demand federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, stating it creates a climate of hostility that endangers scientists.</p>

          <p>Trey Lance made a strong case for the backup quarterback role in the Los Angeles Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes, seemingly closing the gap with competitor Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty. The Chargers' defense also shined, with undrafted rookie Eric Rodgers securing two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, before leaving with an injury. The game provided a crucial opportunity for depth players to prove their value as the regular season approaches.</p>

          <p>Surveillance footage captured a bizarre incident in University Place, Washington, where a DIY towing attempt went disastrously wrong. A man trying to tow a broken-down sedan with a white Honda Pilot and a tow strap saw the strap snap multiple times. Each time the strap broke, the runaway sedan rolled back and crashed into the same Pho and Teriyaki restaurant, causing significant damage. After several failed attempts, the driver and a passenger abandoned the damaged car in the parking lot and fled the scene. Police are investigating the incident as a hit-and-run.</p>

          <p>Congratulations are being shared for President Trump after he won his sixth club championship of 2025 at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. The White House announced that the president shot a gross score of 69, which adjusted to a net 67 after his handicap, implying a low single-digit handicap. The win is another notable achievement in the 79-year-old president's active golf career. Since taking office, President Trump has played dozens of rounds and is known for his passion and skill in the sport, often more so than any previous U.S. president.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked a Trump administration move that would have allowed commercial fishing in the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument. The ruling overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to reverse protections established by the Obama administration. The court stated that the agency violated federal law by attempting to change the rules without the required public notice and comment period. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, who filed the lawsuit, celebrated the decision as a major victory for protecting the monument's vulnerable ecosystems and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's revamped lineup under new manager Arne Slot had a mixed debut in their Community Shield loss to Crystal Palace, showcasing both spectacular attacking potential and clear defensive vulnerabilities. Four new signings started, with Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike impressing in attack, but the team twice surrendered a lead to finish 2-2 before losing on penalties. The performance highlighted a need for defensive reinforcement, particularly at centre-back, and time for the new players to adapt to the system. While the loss was disappointing, the match provided an early look at the team's strengths and weaknesses.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed was the star performer as Trent Rockets maintained their unbeaten start in the men's Hundred, securing a five-wicket victory over the Northern Superchargers. The 20-year-old first took two wickets to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase, which the Rockets completed with four balls remaining. Despite a mid-innings wobble against the Superchargers' spin bowlers, the Rockets' depth proved sufficient to see them over the line in a controlled, if occasionally tense, run chase.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has pushed back against allegations from Chinese state-affiliated media that its H20 artificial intelligence chips represent a national security threat to China. An article on WeChat claimed the chips were not advanced and contained a hardware "backdoor" or "kill switch" that could allow for remote shutdown. Nvidia issued a strong denial, stating its chips do not have backdoors and that cybersecurity is a critical priority. The dispute marks an escalation in tensions over U.S. semiconductor export controls, even as Nvidia has resumed sales of the H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market.

However, he credits the patience learned from breaking and tending to his horse, Danger, for his on-field discipline. This grit was on display in his preseason debut, where he impressed coaches with a hard-fought 11-yard gain, showcasing the focus he hopes will earn a spot in the running back rotation.</p>
