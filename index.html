          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley anticipates a 50% drop in electric vehicle sales next month, from a record 10-12% market share to 5%, following the cessation of federal tax incentives. He suggested that "partial electrification" like hybrids are currently more palatable to consumers due to high EV costs. The company will need to adapt its battery plant and EV production capacity to these changing market dynamics, reflecting a shift in policy impact on the automotive industry.

          <p>The potential U.S. government shutdown hinges on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which currently assist 22 million Americans with health insurance costs. These subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025, potentially causing an average 75% increase in premiums and leading 4 million people to drop coverage. Democratic lawmakers are making the extension a condition for a funding deal, highlighting the significant financial impact on low- and middle-income households.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown, if it occurs, will not interrupt monthly Social Security payments for 74 million Americans, as these benefits are covered by mandatory spending. However, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacement Medicare cards could be temporarily halted. The Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement, typically in October, might also be delayed. Around 90% of SSA employees are deemed essential and would continue working without pay.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly declined in September, reaching its lowest point since April, according to the Conference Board. This drop, coupled with a ninth consecutive monthly fall in job availability perceptions, precedes an anticipated data blackout from the looming federal government shutdown. The weakening labor market and growing pessimism about personal finances are key concerns for Federal Reserve officials as they consider future interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Harris criticized the Biden administration's priorities, stating she would have focused on "kitchen table issues" like affordable childcare and tax credits first. She also expressed disappointment in civic and corporate leaders for capitulating to Trump.</p>

          <p>The Nottingham Post has launched a legal challenge against Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton, who banned the newspaper's reporters from speaking to him and receiving press releases since August. The ban, prompted by an article, was partially lifted for BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists but remains for the Post's other reporters. The newspaper's law firm argues the ban lacks legal basis, breaches freedom of expression, and violates local government regulations and the council's code of conduct.</p>
