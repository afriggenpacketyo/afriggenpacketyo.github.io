          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has received a substantial fine of nearly £31,500 ($42,500) following his dramatic first-round exit from the tournament. The penalty was imposed for unsportsmanlike behavior during his match against Benjamin Bonzi, which included a visible meltdown reportedly sparked by a photographer's presence on court. Medvedev was specifically fined for his general conduct and for destroying a racket against a chair, leading to the forfeiture of approximately 40% of his first-round prize money. The tennis player had anticipated a significant punishment, choosing to refrain from further comment on the incident due to potential additional repercussions, highlighting the strict disciplinary measures in professional tennis.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is reportedly replacing his principal private secretary, Nin Pandit, after just ten months, marking the third senior staff change in his Downing Street office within a year. This follows the earlier departures of his chief of staff and director of communications, raising questions about internal stability and leadership effectiveness. While No 10 contests concerns over Ms. Pandit's performance, stating she is expected to transition to another government position, the move signals ongoing adjustments within the Labour leader's inner circle. This development unfolds as Sir Keir is also anticipated to conduct a broader reshuffle of his junior ministers, reflecting efforts to strengthen his government amidst recent parliamentary challenges and to control information flow more effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK is increasingly seen as an existential threat to the Scottish Conservatives, with recent polls showing Reform consistently leading the Tories in Holyrood voting intentions. This shift is highlighted by the defection of Graham Simpson, the third MSP to quit the Tories for Reform in four months, following others who joined the Liberal Democrats or became independent. The article suggests Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay faces immense pressure, as aligning with Reform's right-wing policies risks alienating moderate voters, while failing to do so could further erode support. This political upheaval echoes past realignments in Scottish politics, signaling a potentially significant change in the upcoming Holyrood election.</p>

          <p>A heavy Russian bombardment on Kyiv overnight has tragically killed eight people, including two children, and injured at least 38 others, as reported by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The "massive" drone and missile attack targeted over 20 districts, causing widespread damage, including a kindergarten catching fire. Zelenskyy condemned the assault, asserting that the Kremlin chose "ballistics instead of the negotiating table" and reiterated his demand for new, tough sanctions on Russia. This devastating attack follows earlier drone strikes on energy infrastructure and occurs amidst ongoing international efforts, including US President Donald Trump's initiatives, to broker a peace deal and establish security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, is reviewed as a bruising and energetic crime caper set in 1998 New York City. Austin Butler stars as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player who inadvertently gets entangled with various criminal factions after agreeing to watch a cat, leading to a violent and chaotic pursuit. The article praises Aronofsky's affectionate portrayal of a grimy, pre-millennial New York and the film's vibrant soundtrack. It highlights Butler's performance as a self-loathing protagonist grappling with squandered potential, emphasizing the director's recurring thematic interest in characters at risk of failing to achieve greatness.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will attend China's "Victory Day" military parade in Beijing next week, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War Two surrender, alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin and 26 other heads of state. This landmark visit signifies a key diplomatic achievement for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who seeks to project Beijing's influence on a new world order. The event is expected to showcase China's latest weaponry and its military's new force structure. Kim's attendance, his first in six years, will provide a significant photo-op and strategic briefing opportunity for Xi ahead of potential meetings with US President Donald Trump, while Western leaders are largely expected to boycott due to Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Europe is currently enduring its worst wildfire season on record, with an unprecedented one million hectares burned across the European Union this year, an area equivalent to half the landmass of Wales. Spain and Portugal have been particularly hard-hit, accounting for over two-thirds of the total area scorched, a figure dramatically exceeding their historical averages. Experts directly attribute the intensification of these fires to climate change, which generates more extreme heat and dries out vegetation, significantly increasing flammability. Beyond the immediate devastation, these wildfires release record amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing to a detrimental climate feedback loop. Rural depopulation also exacerbates the problem by leaving agricultural land abandoned and overgrown, further increasing fire risk.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense in a civil lawsuit alleging assault received a boost from witness testimony in a Beverly Hills court. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, is being sued by a security guard, Emani Ellis, over a 2018 incident. A receptionist and the obstetrician testified they saw Ellis initiate physical contact and cause an injury to the receptionist, but never saw Cardi B strike Ellis. Cardi B herself denied touching, scratching, or spitting on Ellis, whom she believed was recording her. The rapper argued she was pregnant and smaller than the guard, making a physical confrontation unlikely, as the defense concluded its presentation.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old New Orleans boy with autism, Bryan Vasquez, who had been missing for nearly two weeks, likely died from an alligator attack, police confirmed. His body was discovered in a New Orleans canal after a drone search. The Orleans Parish Coroner determined his cause of death as "drowning with blunt trauma consistent with an alligator attack." The case, now an unclassified death investigation, follows a massive search effort that drew criticism for the New Orleans Police Department's delayed response. City officials described Bryan as a "bright, charismatic, and energetic young boy," and the police chief has requested the removal of "nuisance" alligators from the area.</p>

Monarez and her lawyers assert she has not resigned and has not been formally fired by the President, arguing she is being "targeted" for her pro-science stance against HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine policy changes. The White House, however, maintains she was "terminated." This standoff has triggered a wave of resignations from senior CDC officials, who cite the "weaponization of public health" and express alarm over the "systematic dismantling of public health institutions" and the politicization of science, leaving the nation unprepared.</p>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has urged caution regarding the global surge in stablecoin interest, advocating for a "multidimensional assessment" of their utility and potential systemic risks. Speaking at a closed-door seminar, Zhou warned against stablecoins being excessively used for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and financial instability. He highlighted concerns that some industry players might exploit hype to boost valuations rather than focusing on business profitability or sustainability, deeming this detrimental to the healthy development of the financial system. His comments come as the US and Hong Kong develop stablecoin regulatory frameworks, prompting speculation about China's future approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese envoy has issued a strong warning to the United States against fostering "fear and hostility" as the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes significant new visa restrictions impacting Chinese journalists, students, and scholars. The proposed rule aims to cap stays for mainland Chinese journalists at 90 days and implement a four-year limit for all international students and scholars on F and J visas. The envoy urged both nations to encourage and facilitate travels and people-to-people exchanges instead of erecting barriers and pursuing decoupling. DHS justifies these changes by citing a substantial increase in entries on F, J, and I visas, which it claims poses a challenge to its ability to monitor and oversee non-immigrants while they are in the US.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly told Denmark to "calm down" after its top diplomat in Copenhagen was summoned over allegations of covert American influence operations in Greenland. Danish public broadcaster DR reported that individuals with connections to former President Trump were allegedly attempting to infiltrate Greenlandic society to promote its secession from Denmark to the US. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen declared any attempt to interfere in the Kingdom's internal affairs "unacceptable," while Danish intelligence warned that Greenland is a target for "various kinds of influence campaigns." This diplomatic spat highlights persistent tensions since Trump's past proposals to annex Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, and underscores the strategic importance of the Arctic region amidst international competition.</p>

          <p>Nevada's state government systems were severely crippled by a "sophisticated ransomware-based cybersecurity attack," with officials now revealing that personal information may have been compromised. Initially, Governor Joe Lombardo had stated no personal data was stolen, but the state's chief information officer later confirmed evidence of data exfiltration by malicious actors. The attack brought numerous essential state services to a standstill, including DMV offices and law enforcement access to state records, with some state police dispatch phone lines experiencing outages. Cybersecurity experts emphasize that state and local governments are increasingly becoming prime targets for such cyberattacks, a trend observed over the past 12-18 months, highlighting the critical vulnerability and urgent necessity for enhanced defenses across smaller government agencies nationwide.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang expressed confidence in continued record-breaking years, citing massive capital expenditures by cloud providers and a projected $3-4 trillion AI infrastructure spend by decade-end.

His expenditures reportedly included luxury cars, mortgage payments, home renovations, and even covering costs for surrogacy and private school tuition. Brown, who had produced indie films, is accused of actively concealing his checkered past and using a company he controlled to bill for services that were never rendered or already paid for.
