          <h2>Harvard Challenges Trump's Restrictions on Foreign Students</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has filed a complaint against President Trump's action to block foreign students from attending the school, calling it retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The complaint argues that Trump's action circumvents a previous court order that prevented the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard's ability to host foreign students. Harvard contends that Trump's legal justification for the action is invalid and that the measure is intended to punish the university for exercising its First Amendment rights. If the measure stands, it would impact thousands of international students scheduled to attend Harvard. The school argues that it is being punished for First Amendment-protected speech. Optimism is tempered by the university's defense against the government's actions.</p>

          <p>The Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed former President Joe Biden's White House physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, to testify before the panel. The committee is seeking details about O'Connor's assessment of and relationship with Biden, specifically regarding his fitness to serve. Comer stated that the committee seeks to understand if O'Connor contributed to hiding Biden's fitness from the American people. This inquiry has expanded recently due to emerging reports on Biden's mental acuity and the circumstances surrounding his withdrawal from the 2024 election. The investigation also includes an inquiry into whether Biden's aides conspired to use an autopen to conceal his cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>Boxer and influencer Jake Paul weighed in on the public dispute between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, suggesting it reflects a broader issue within the Republican Party. Paul described the issue as a problem with 'alpha male egos' and leaders who aren't mature enough to work together. He called for Trump and Musk to collaborate for the benefit of America, not to make the country look bad. Paul has been a vocal supporter of Trump, endorsing him prior to the election and citing statistics about the economy under the Biden-Harris administration. He has also addressed issues such as women’s reproductive rights and transgender athletes in women’s sports.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control has sanctioned six accused drug traffickers allegedly using boats and "narco subs" to traffic cocaine. The sanctioned individuals include four Guyanese nationals and two Colombians who are accused of trafficking tons of cocaine from South America to the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean. Daby Jr. and Duncan are said to operate the largest drug trafficking operation in Guyana, utilizing "narco subs," airstrips, and various individuals. Guyana has become a major hotspot for cocaine trafficking due to its proximity to the Caribbean and alleged corruption at its ports and borders.</p>

          <p>A new travel ban implemented by President Trump is causing fear and frustration among immigrants from the targeted countries. Immigrants are expressing concerns that the ban will disrupt their lives and create uncertainty about their future in the United States. One Haitian asylum seeker stated that they do not understand why the president has to target them nonstop. The travel ban is built on lessons learned from first-term fights, and the addition of visa overstays as a rationale could provide an opening for new legal challenges, according to migrant advocates.</p>

          <p>Chinese students in the United States are facing uncertainty about their future in the country following the State Department's announcement that it would aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students and enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong.

The presidential proclamation cited Harvard's links with China as a particular cause for concern. Students are expressing concerns about discrimination and the potential impact on their academic careers, and some are considering studying in other countries instead.</p>

Brooks contends that Democrats must adapt to a new historical era characterized by a comprehensive sense of social distrust and a conviction that societal systems are rigged.

          <p>The bromance between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump has ended with public disagreements and personal attacks. After Trump threatened to cut off federal subsidies to Musk's companies, Musk claimed that Trump appears in government documents about convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The feud marks the end of an alliance that saw Musk become a major Republican donor and a member of Trump's inner circle. The relationship began to sour after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to a series of escalating exchanges on social media.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is doubling down on claims, without evidence, that former President Joe Biden's aides illegally used an autopen to enact policies he didn't support. Trump has ordered the Justice Department to investigate the claims, which Biden denies. Trump claimed he could tell which of Biden's executive orders were signed with an autopen and that aides used it to enact "open borders" and transgender rights policies. He also stated that "radical left, horrible people" worked around Biden without his knowing consent.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the nation’s anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of whether those complaining of bias are white or Black, gay or straight. The justices rejected the view that "members of a majority group" must show more evidence of discrimination before they can sue and win. The ruling revives a discrimination lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who said she was demoted and discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated that the law "draws no distinctions between majority-group plaintiffs and minority-group plaintiffs."</p>
