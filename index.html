          <p>The US has imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, bringing the total to 50%, in response to India's oil purchases from Russia. This move threatens India's $87 billion export market to the US, its largest trading partner. Economists warn the tariffs could significantly reduce India's GDP growth, with sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics being the most vulnerable. The article notes that while some products like electronics are currently exempt, the overall competitiveness of Indian exports is at high risk compared to regional peers who have secured lower tariff rates.

The Times highlights an Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis suggesting potential council tax hikes under Labour's funding reallocation plans. Other major stories include an international call to reverse the UK's ban on the activist group Palestine Action and criticism of a "British guilt" seminar offered to civil servants.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong growth, with exports increasing by 7.2% year-over-year, significantly beating economists' forecasts. Imports also saw their largest jump in a year, rising 4.1%, which suggests a potential recovery in domestic demand. This economic performance comes as a US tariff truce deadline of August 12 approaches, with analysts suggesting some of the export strength may be due to businesses front-loading shipments to avoid future duties. Despite the positive trade figures, China's factory activity unexpectedly contracted, indicating underlying weaknesses in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute reveals that the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is America's most-stolen vehicle, with a theft rate 39 times higher than the average car. The analysis, which covered 2022-2024 models, found that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks are common targets for thieves. The Camaro's vulnerability is heightened by an easily accessible on-board data port that thieves can exploit to steal the vehicle. In contrast, electric and hybrid vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in secure garages for charging.</p>

          <p>A wide-ranging set of "reciprocal" tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on dozens of countries has officially come into effect. The levies range from 10% for the UK to 41% for Syria and are applied on top of existing duties, creating significant economic pressure on US trading partners. Several nations, including Switzerland and India, are actively trying to negotiate reversals or reductions to the new taxes, which they fear could harm their economies. While some countries like Vietnam and Thailand secured lower rates through deals, the broad implementation marks a significant escalation in global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis for the BBC reveals a widening gap between mental and physical healthcare in England, with patients waiting for mental health treatment facing significantly longer delays. The article profiles a young woman named Amy, diagnosed with complex PTSD, who has only seen a psychiatrist once in ten years despite multiple crises. This reflects a systemic issue where the mental health backlog remains stubbornly high while physical health waiting lists are declining. Experts warn that these delays worsen patient outcomes and increase long-term costs, while a new walk-in hub in London offers a potential but hard-to-scale model for better care.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced it will increase its investment in US manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic commitment to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House alongside President Trump, who praised the move as a step toward ensuring iPhones sold in America are also made in America. This commitment comes as Apple seeks to mitigate the impact of threatened tariffs on its international supply chain. The new investment will focus on bringing more of Apple's component production to the US and is expected to create 20,000 new jobs.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has implemented an indefinite fishing ban on several major rivers in Yellowstone National Park, including the Madison and Firehole rivers. The closure is a protective measure for the park's native trout population, which is under extreme stress from unusually high water temperatures and low river flows. Officials noted that water temperatures have recently exceeded 68 degrees Fahrenheit, a level that can be fatal to fish. The ban highlights the broader impact of warming waters on ecosystems, a global issue that threatens marine life and contributes to extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The United States has threatened to levy an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, which would bring the total rate to 50%, one of the highest imposed by the US. The executive order cites India's continued purchases of Russian oil as undermining US foreign policy efforts related to the war in Ukraine. The new tariffs are set to take effect in 21 days, giving India a window to respond. India's foreign ministry has called the move "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," noting that its imports of Russian oil increased after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe.

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetics industry to protect consumers from dangerous practitioners. The new regulations will introduce a licensing scheme for clinics offering procedures like Botox and dermal fillers, requiring them to meet strict safety and training standards. For the most high-risk treatments, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), only qualified health professionals will be permitted to perform them. The move, which also includes age restrictions, has been welcomed by industry safety advocates following a rise in complications and at least one death from unregulated procedures.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has expressed concern over the latest US jobs report, stating that the significant downward revisions for previous months could signal an economic "turning point." The July report showed weaker-than-expected job growth and revised the hiring numbers for May and June down by a combined 258,000 jobs. Cook noted that such large revisions are often typical during periods of economic inflection and suggested that uncertainty is acting like a "tax" on businesses.

Trump claimed the BLS released "phony" strong job numbers just before the 2024 election and revised them down afterward, but the facts show the opposite. A major downward revision of over 800,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, months before the election. Furthermore, the final jobs report before the election showed a dramatic slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used to criticize his opponent at the time, contradicting his current claims of pre-election manipulation.</p>
