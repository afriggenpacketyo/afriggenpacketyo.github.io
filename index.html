          <h2>Federal Court Rejects Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:46:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs without congressional approval. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties. The ruling, which caused Dow futures to jump 500 points, has been swiftly appealed by the Trump administration, which claims the tariffs are necessary to address a national economic emergency caused by foreign countries' nonreciprocal trade practices. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a lead plaintiff in the case, hailed the ruling as a victory for working families and small businesses, arguing that the tariffs inflated prices and burdened Americans.

          <p>Golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from southern Scotland, raising hopes that they may nest in the area. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has translocated juveniles and sub-adults from the Scottish Highlands since 2018. Satellite tagging confirms that some eagles are exploring Northumberland and other areas, marking a potentially significant milestone. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th century due to persecution, and the project aims to reestablish a population in the region, with conservationists expressing hope that the birds will settle in areas like the Lake District and Northumberland Uplands.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing, a strategy that has long been criticized by the U.S. and its major trade partners. This push for manufacturing-led growth could put China and the U.S. on a collision course, as Trump seeks to reduce trade imbalances and end state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts suggest there is little room for China to scale back its manufacturing strategy, which is closely tied to Beijing's drive for self-reliance, especially in high-tech sectors.</p>

The nonprofit is demanding a full refund and is prepared to pursue legal action. Fortunately, the students still made it to prom after parents ordered Ubers for the group.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration would "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is also revising visa criteria to "enhance scrutiny" of all future applications from China, including Hong Kong. This move has sparked anxiety across university campuses in the United States, as many universities rely on Chinese and other international students for a substantial part of their annual revenue. The phrase “critical fields” most likely refers to research in the physical sciences.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided seemingly strong guidance, but the market response was muted. Revenue in the first quarter rose 8% year over year to $9.83 billion, and adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.58, beating expectations. However, investors discovered that the improved outlook was partly driven by a weaker U.S. dollar, rather than solely by improvements in the underlying business. Despite this, the company is seeing progress on AI, with combined annual recurring revenue for Data Cloud and Agentforce exceeding $1 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has stated that the Trump administration’s bid to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist, is likely unconstitutional. Judge Michael Farbiarz wrote that the government’s justification for removing Khalil—that his beliefs may pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy—could lead to vague and arbitrary enforcement. However, the judge stopped short of ordering Khalil's release, citing concerns about the completeness of his residency application. Attorneys for Khalil argue his detention is part of a broader attempt by the Trump administration to suppress free speech.</p>
