        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Trump's suggestion of Canada becoming the 51st state, stating that Canada is "not for sale ever." Trump responded with "never say never," indicating his continued interest in the idea despite Canada's stance. The exchange occurred amidst discussions on trade relations, which Trump described as unfairly subsidizing Canada. Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration between the two countries, but reiterated Canada's unwavering position on maintaining its sovereignty, with the talks occurring due to Carney's anti-Trump platform which propelled him to power.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, significantly jeopardizing Martin's confirmation. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants involved in the January 6th Capitol riot, a move seen as controversial given that the D.C. Attorney's Office prosecuted those cases. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination faces an uphill battle in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where a tie vote would prevent the nomination from advancing. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire soon.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled for the second time that the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport alleged gang members is unlawful, specifically in the case of two individuals suspected of affiliation with the Tren de Aragua gang. Judge Alvin Hellerstein granted a preliminary injunction, stating that the AEA was "not validly invoked" and that the individuals were not given adequate due process. This ruling follows a similar decision in Texas, where a judge permanently blocked the administration from using the AEA for deportations, highlighting ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Tesla's vehicle registrations in key European markets like Germany and Britain have plummeted to their lowest levels in over two years, despite increasing demand for electric vehicles in the region. Analysts suggest this decline is due to a combination of factors, including the backlash against President Trump’s tariffs, which is fueling a European push to shun U.S. products, and anger towards Tesla CEO Elon Musk for his political endorsements. While deliveries of the newest Model Y version may also be a factor, experts believe the issue is more deeply rooted in anti-Musk sentiment and increased competition from European and Chinese EV manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the world's largest international organization fighting hunger, is facing a projected 40% reduction in funding due to dwindling donations and cuts from the Trump administration.

The U.S. State Department cited concerns about funds ending up in the hands of terrorist groups as the reason for cutting aid to some regions, leading to warnings from WFP that these cuts could amount to a "death sentence for millions of people."</p>

          <p>Yair Wallach argues that Benjamin Netanyahu's announced plan for an intensified military offensive in Gaza, dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariots, may be driven more by political considerations than military strategy. With increasing public pressure and scandals, Netanyahu's government is determined to pursue an open-ended war, making the Gaza Strip increasingly uninhabitable. The long-term horizon is the ethnic cleansing of the strip and its reoccupation by Israel, as part of a vision for a Jewish-exclusive state between the river and the sea. Meanwhile, the starvation of Gaza intensifies as Israel has not allowed any food to enter the strip since March 2.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above target levels, some sectors of the U.S. economy have recently seen price declines, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline.

However, economists warn that these lower prices are unlikely to last due to potential tariff increases and other factors that could put upward pressure on consumer prices. Therefore, consumers should enjoy these lower prices, because they're not here to stay.</p>

The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export products like whisky and cars to India, while cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. UK consumers are expected to benefit from lower tariffs on goods coming from India, and some Indian and British workers will gain from a three-year National Insurance exemption.

Merz frequently makes a point of mentioning that, for several months now, he has been in regular contact with European heads of government. Merz raised the prospect of Germany delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv, positioning himself in direct opposition to Scholz, who consistently opposed Taurus deliveries and warned against any further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Coterra Energy is cutting back on its oil drilling in response to sagging crude prices and spending more on natural gas production, leading to a stock sell-off. While executives explained their plan to fix the issue on Tuesday's earnings call, some operational issues in a certain part of the company's Texas acreage are getting a lot of attention and are likely among the biggest drivers of the steep stock decline. Coterra is still worth owning as our only oil-and-gas play, providing a solid dividend payout, acting as a geopolitical hedge and offering some exposure to long-term trends that could drive increased natural gas demand. However, investors might be questioning what these changes mean to Coterra's production levels in 2026 and 2027.</p>

          <p>Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark led a predawn protest outside an immigrant detention facility on Tuesday, trying to keep the jailhouse from becoming a critical part of the Trump administration’s ability to enact mass deportations. The mayor has been trying to stop the facility, which is expected to hold up to 1,000 migrants a day, from operating. In court, the city has argued that the detention center’s owner, GEO Group — one of America’s largest private prison companies — had begun operating without the required permits. The early morning public pressure led to a tense, hourslong standoff, resulting in the Newark fire officials issuing the prison company three citations for code violations.</p>

          <p>The Trump Administration resumed collection efforts on defaulted student loans Monday after a roughly five-year hiatus. The Treasury Department will send notices to 5.3 million defaulted borrowers about the collection activity of their wages "later this summer," and federal benefits could be garnished by June. The Trump administration's aggressive collection activity is a sharp turn away from the Biden administration's strategy of extending relief measures to struggling borrowers. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport temporarily lost radar and communications with aircraft, their union said, detailing an equipment failure that led to massive flight delays. Staffing shortages followed the incident, which was so severe that some of the controllers involved "have taken time off to recover from the stress of multiple recent outages," the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday. The FAA partially blamed the runway construction for the delays, but the construction project has been long running and airlines have factored that in. In a note to customers, CEO Scott Kirby said that last week's "technology issues were compounded as over 20% of the FAA controllers for EWR walked off the job."</p>

The situation is compounded by looting and violence, with the UN's humanitarian director calling the Israeli blockade "a cruel collective punishment" on civilians.

The attack comes two days after the Iran-backed Houthis fired a missile that landed near Israel's main airport, forcing it to close briefly. On Monday, Israel responded by striking the Yemeni port city of Hudaydah. The Houthis warned that the Israeli "aggression will not pass without a response, and Yemen will not be discouraged from its stance in support of Gaza".</p>
