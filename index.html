          <p>Opening statements are set for the trial of Ryan Routh, who is accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at a golf course last year. Prosecutors claim Routh had a detailed plan, while Routh, who is representing himself, intends to focus on his peaceful character. The trial is being overseen by Judge Aileen Cannon, who has limited the scope of Routh's defense, barring arguments of justification or First Amendment protection. Routh faces multiple criminal counts that could result in a life sentence if convicted.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, has dismissed Peter Mandelson, the Ambassador to the United States, following the release of new documents detailing his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The documents, including a letter where Mandelson called Epstein his "best pal," revealed a depth to the relationship previously unknown at the time of his appointment. The British Foreign Office stated that Mandelson's suggestion that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful was new information that prompted the immediate withdrawal.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical view on the integration of artificial intelligence in universities, arguing that its widespread use for cheating degrades the educational experience and subverts institutional goals. The author contends that current university policies are inadequate and proposes radical solutions to preserve academic integrity, especially for liberal-arts colleges. These measures include eliminating Wi-Fi in favor of Ethernet, banning laptops and smartphones on campus, and requiring in-person, proctored exams. The author suggests such a "de-teching" would create a more focused and intellectually vibrant campus culture.</p>

The meeting comes amid ongoing treatment for the King's cancer and a period of strained relations within the royal family since Harry and Meghan's move to California. While details of the private tea meeting were not disclosed, Harry later commented that his father was "doing great." The visit did not include a meeting with his brother, Prince William, with whom relations reportedly remain non-existent.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 31, was fatally shot by a single bullet while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. The shooting, which authorities are treating as an assassination, occurred in front of a crowd of 3,000 and has sparked a massive manhunt for a suspect believed to have fired from a nearby rooftop. Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and a close ally of President Trump, was a highly influential but divisive figure in youth politics. The event has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, while also intensifying partisan divisions.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down a law that prevented husbands from taking their wives' surnames, declaring it a form of gender-based discrimination. The landmark ruling was a victory for two couples who had challenged the law as archaic and patriarchal, arguing it violated the equality rights in the country's post-apartheid constitution. Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the judgment. The case was supported by legal bodies who argued the old law perpetuated harmful stereotypes by denying men a choice available to women.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature has attributed over 200 severe global heat waves, including the deadly 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome, directly to the greenhouse gas emissions of major fossil fuel producers. The research quantifies the responsibility of specific companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP, finding that their pollution made these extreme weather events substantially more likely and intense. Some of the heat waves were found to be "virtually impossible" without the emissions from these "carbon majors." This research adds to a growing body of evidence used in litigation against oil companies for climate-change-related damages.</p>

With an estimated investment of 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), the project is described as the largest integrated initiative on the river since the original dam's construction.

          <p>A proposal by Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, to annex a large portion of the West Bank is creating a significant foreign policy challenge for the Trump administration. This move directly threatens the Abraham Accords, a signature achievement of President Trump's first term, which saw several Arab nations normalize relations with Israel in exchange for a halt to such annexation plans. The United Arab Emirates has already warned that annexation is a "red line," forcing a planned Israeli cabinet discussion to be postponed. The situation forces President Trump to decide between supporting his Israeli allies' domestic agenda and preserving his own foreign-policy legacy.</p>

          <p>This article presents a photographic look back at the world-changing polio vaccination campaign in the United States during the 1950s. At its peak in 1952, polio outbreaks caused tens of thousands of cases of paralysis and thousands of deaths annually. The introduction of the vaccine, which became widely available in 1955, marked a monumental public health achievement. Within a decade, the campaign successfully reduced the number of new polio cases in the U.S. to fewer than 100 per year, demonstrating the profound impact of mass vaccination.</p>

          <p>At least 19 people have died and several others are missing after severe flash floods and landslides struck two islands in Indonesia. The tourist destination of Bali was heavily affected, with 14 confirmed deaths, while five fatalities were reported on the island of Flores. Rescue operations are ongoing as authorities search for the missing, and over 500 people have been evacuated to makeshift shelters. While Indonesia's monsoon season regularly brings such events, officials note that climate change has been altering storm patterns, leading to heavier rainfall and more severe flooding in recent years.</p>

          <p>David Coote, a former Premier League referee, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of making an indecent image of a child. The 43-year-old was charged in August following a Nottinghamshire Police investigation related to a video file recovered in February. Coote, who was previously dismissed by the referees' governing body (PGMOL) for unrelated comments, appeared in court and was granted conditional bail. His case is scheduled to be heard at Nottingham Crown Court in October. The charge pertains to activities such as downloading or saving child sexual abuse material.</p>

          <p>The Angolan Student Movement (MEA) is threatening further protests against the government, citing a severe crisis in the country's education system. Students and teachers point to rising tuition fees, a lack of basic resources like desks and books, and a shortage of over 86,000 teachers as evidence of the government's neglect. Despite recent government promises of increased funding, the MEA and the national teachers' union remain skeptical, warning of potential nationwide strikes. Critics argue the political elite has no interest in improving public education, creating a system that disadvantages the poor.</p>

          <p>Attendees at the Utah Valley University event where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot have described scenes of mass panic and confusion immediately following the attack. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a single loud bang before seeing Kirk fall from his stool, which prompted the crowd of 3,000 to drop to the ground and then scramble for safety. Some attendees expressed surprise at the lack of security measures, such as bag checks, at the outdoor event. The shooting, which law enforcement believes came from a shooter on a nearby roof, has left many of the young attendees traumatized.</p>

          <p>This article explores the growing trend of pro-Palestinian faculty at U.S. universities facing formal complaints and lengthy investigations for alleged antisemitism, often under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. As the Trump administration uses the legislation to scrutinize universities, some schools are responding to pressure by investigating faculty over speech that might have been dismissed in the past. The article details the experiences of several professors, including one who resigned after an eight-month ordeal, arguing that these actions create a chilling effect on academic freedom and critical dissent. The investigations have come at a great professional and personal cost for the targeted educators.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah is facing backlash for his response to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While Lee quickly condemned the shooting as a "cowardly act of violence," critics on social media pointed to his very different reaction to the fatal shooting of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota just months earlier. Following that incident, Lee had posted misinformation and conspiracy theories suggesting the shooter was a "Marxist," posts he later deleted. This perceived hypocrisy has drawn sharp criticism, with many accusing the senator of applying a partisan standard to tragedies involving political violence.</p>

While imprisoned, he unknowingly became a symbol for the movement to free the detainees.

The deal, brokered by Governor Newsom, would streamline the approval process for up to 2,000 new onshore oil wells per year in Kern County to address concerns about refinery closures and rising gas prices. Concurrently, the bill makes future offshore drilling more difficult by tightening safety and regulatory requirements for pipelines. The package attempts to balance the interests of the fossil-fuel industry and climate activists, though both sides have expressed reservations.</p>

The governor had sought to fast-track the project's legal and environmental reviews, but the effort died in the final days of the session amid opposition. Supporters argue the tunnel is crucial for modernizing the state's water infrastructure against climate change, while opponents, including environmental and tribal groups, contend it would devastate the Delta's ecosystem and harm endangered fish populations.

The bill was inspired by students like TJ McGee of UC Berkeley, who faced disciplinary action after his friends called for help during his overdose. If signed by the governor, the law will require schools to offer rehabilitation options instead of punishment, extending "Good Samaritan" protections to campus environments.</p>

This article analyzes the current climate, linking the rise in violent acts to factors like intense economic inequity, deep political divisions, and hyperbolic rhetoric from leaders that demonizes opponents. Experts suggest that a sense of "democratic despair," where people feel the political system is broken, can lead individuals to believe violence is the only solution.

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used the improved sensitivity of LIGO detectors to confirm a key theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. By analyzing the waves from a collision of two black holes, researchers verified Hawking's area theorem, which states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. The analysis showed the final merged black hole had a larger surface area than the sum of the two initial black holes. This observational proof marks a significant milestone in physics, validating a foundational concept of black hole mechanics.</p>

They warn that these chatbots can "hallucinate" or produce inaccurate information, which can be difficult for non-medically trained individuals to spot.
