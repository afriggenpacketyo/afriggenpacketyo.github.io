            <p>The U.S. Naval Academy canceled a planned speech by author and podcaster Ryan Holiday due to concerns about its potential political content, particularly a reference to the academy's decision to remove books from its library following President Trump's order to eliminate "un-American" theories. Holiday, who intended to discuss the pursuit of wisdom, refused to omit the reference, leading to the cancellation. The Navy emphasized its commitment to remaining apolitical and focusing on developing midshipmen for service. This decision highlights the ongoing tensions between academic freedom and political sensitivities within military institutions, especially concerning discussions of current events.</p>

            <p>An article discusses the negative stereotypes of stepmothers in popular culture, tracing them back to myths like Medea and fairy tales like Snow White. A recent survey reveals that many single mothers are deterred from dating parents due to fears of being perceived as a wicked stepmother. The piece argues that these stereotypes, often rooted in anxieties about inheritance and the disruption of family dynamics, are outdated. It suggests that stepmothers, like biological mothers, are often unfairly hated, and that true love and connection are still possible in blended families.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point amid concerns about tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey indicates a decline in economic optimism since his reelection, with more Americans believing the economy will worsen. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are increasingly negative about his economic policies. The public disapproves of his handling of inflation and federal spending, but immigration remains a strong point for the president.</p>
