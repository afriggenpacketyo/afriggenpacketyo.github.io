          <p>The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation into Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, following accusations of lying to Congress about his pandemic decisions as governor, according to this New York Times article. This action comes after the Justice Department dismissed corruption charges against current Mayor Eric Adams. The investigation is fueling criticism that President Trump is using the Justice Department for political gain. Cuomo's spokesperson questions the investigation's basis, calling it election interference, while Trump administration officials insist they are establishing a 'one-tier' justice system. The investigation could impact Cuomo's chances in the upcoming primary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration will not finalize a rule allowing Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, despite some states like South Carolina choosing to cover these weight loss drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. GLP-1s are a pricey class of drugs that have shown promise in treating obesity, but access remains limited due to cost concerns among insurers. South Carolina Medicaid requires beneficiaries to meet stringent prerequisites, including documented efforts to lose weight through diet and exercise. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests future coverage may be possible as costs decrease. The state anticipates that only a small fraction of obese adults will access this benefit due to rigorous approval processes.

The lawsuit coincides with reports of a trans softball pitcher's success, sparking debate, and Ellison is also suing President Trump to ensure trans athletes' continued participation.

          <p>Under increasing pressure from allies, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has permitted limited aid into Gaza for the first time in over two months, acknowledging concerns about famine conditions. This action follows rising death tolls and international outcry over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Despite allowing a few trucks to enter, the UN's World Food Program emphasizes that much more aid is needed to address the vast and urgent needs of the population. Leaders from the UK, France, and Canada have issued a joint statement condemning Israel's denial of humanitarian assistance and threatening further action, including targeted sanctions.

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for a budget package, facing resistance from conservatives demanding steeper spending cuts and moderates opposing changes to the state and local tax deduction. Speaker Mike Johnson is working to build consensus, but factions threaten to derail the plan. Conservatives want Medicaid work requirements implemented sooner and the elimination of clean energy subsidies, while moderates resist cuts to Medicaid. Trump opposes raising the SALT cap and reiterated his support for cutting waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the original bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>A new analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reveals that red meat studies with industry funding are more likely to report favorable health results compared to independently funded studies. The analysis examined 44 clinical trials and found that industry-funded trials often neglected to compare red meat to heart-healthy foods like whole grains and plant-based proteins. Experts express concern that these biased results can confuse consumers and undermine nutrition science.

          <p>Representative Chip Roy of Texas is leading a group of right-wing holdouts pushing for substantial changes to the House's spending bill, arguing it would add too much to the national debt, according to this New York Times article. Roy, known for his combative style and fiscal conservatism, has long had a fraught relationship with President Trump. He is pressing for deeper cuts to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. Whether Roy will relent or dig in could determine the fate of the bill.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration deported two Asian immigrants to South Sudan, defying court orders to halt removals to third countries, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The deportations occurred despite a judge's order requiring due process and notice of removals in the detainees' languages.
