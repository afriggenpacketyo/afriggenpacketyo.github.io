        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly evaluating a broad list of eleven candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve Chair. Among the newly surfaced contenders are prominent financial figures David Zervos of Jefferies and Rick Rieder from BlackRock, expanding a list that already includes several current and former Fed officials. The selection is being managed as a "deliberative process" by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will narrow the field before presenting a final list to the president. This thorough approach indicates a decision may take considerable time, potentially easing concerns about abrupt policy shifts or market instability during the transition period.</p>

Tributes have poured in from across the political spectrum, including from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who called him a "powerful voice for the people of Wales." David was known as a popular and lively backbencher who was passionate about his constituency and unafraid to challenge the party line. Gwent Police stated that the death is not being treated as suspicious, and colleagues have expressed profound sadness over the loss of a dedicated public servant.</p>

          <h2>Weekly Mortgage Refinance Demand Surges by 23% Amid Renewed Interest in Riskier Loans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 08:03:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. mortgage application volume saw a significant increase last week, driven by a 23% jump in refinancing demand as interest rates slightly decreased. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that this surge was the strongest for refinancing since last April, with a notable rise in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are considered riskier loan products. While homeowners are actively seeking savings, demand from potential homebuyers remained sluggish, with purchase applications rising only 1%. This trend suggests borrowers with larger existing loans are more sensitive to rate fluctuations than new buyers facing historically high home prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Mediterranean fast-casual chain Cava dropped over 20% after the company reduced its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth. The new projection is 4% to 6%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%, following a disappointing second quarter where same-store sales grew just 2.1%, far below Wall Street's 6.1% estimate. While the company's revenue and net income showed year-over-year growth due to new store openings, customer traffic was reportedly flat. Cava's CFO attributed the slowdown to the difficult comparison with last year's successful launch of its grilled steak option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sig Hansen, the 59-year-old captain from the show "Deadliest Catch," has opened up about how multiple life-threatening health scares at sea have altered his perspective on life. The veteran fisherman told Fox News Digital that surviving a heart attack and a severe infection has made him more fearful of his dangerous profession but also more appreciative of his family. Hansen stated that these close calls with his own mortality have shifted his priorities, making him want to spend more time with his wife, daughters, and grandchild. He now feels a greater responsibility to be present for his family after decades spent away on the Bering Sea.</p>

An analysis explores the potential dual impact of these cuts, highlighting how they would not only affect food security for low-income families but also threaten the viability of independent grocery stores. These stores, which have already faced significant challenges over the last five years, rely on SNAP-related purchases for a substantial portion of their revenue.

          <p>The domestic abuse charity Refuge has reported a disturbing increase in violent threats and strangulation targeting young women and girls aged 16-25 in Britain. According to their data from the past year, nearly half of the young women reporting physical abuse were subjected to strangulation or suffocation, a 9% rise from the previous year. Furthermore, among those reporting psychological abuse, there was a 4% increase in threats of harm and a finding that 35% had received death threats. The charity is calling for improved education on the signs of abuse and coercive control to address this escalating crisis.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance's summer trip to the picturesque Cotswolds in the U.K. was met with protests, as locals organized a "Vance not welcome party." Demonstrators held signs with messages like "Bullies not welcome here" and others that humorously mocked the Vice President, reflecting local frustration over his visit. The Stop Trump Coalition, which organized the event, cited Vance's past criticisms of the U.K. and the administration's foreign policy positions as reasons for the outrage. The protest, described as a "joyous festival of resistance," garnered significant attention on social media.</p>

          <p>A Catholic priest in Alabama, Robert Sullivan, is under investigation after a woman alleged he began a relationship of "private companionship," including sex and financial support, with her when she was 17. The accuser, now 33, claims Sullivan later paid her hundreds of thousands of dollars in a non-disclosure agreement to ensure her silence, which she supported with financial records. The Diocese of Birmingham has reported the allegations to its independent review board and the Vatican, and Sullivan has been placed on personal leave, prohibited from public ministry.

          <p>The new book "A Marriage at Sea" recounts the extraordinary survival story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, a British couple who spent 117 days adrift on a small inflatable raft in the Pacific Ocean in 1973. After a whale struck and sank their sailboat, the couple endured starvation and illness, surviving on rainwater and turtles. The book explores the dynamics of their relationship under extreme duress, highlighting Maralyn's optimism in keeping her more negative husband's spirits up.

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate in the UK has fallen below 5%. According to data from Moneyfacts, the rate has reached 4.99%, a figure described as a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers that indicates increased competition among lenders. This easing of rates provides some relief for the 1.6 million borrowers whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. However, analysts caution that rates are unlikely to fall substantially further, as inflation is forecast to remain elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London's status as a premier global financial center is facing significant challenges, including persistently high inflation compared to the U.S., ongoing economic friction from Brexit, and uncertainty over tax rules for wealthy foreigners. A CNBC analysis notes that these factors have contributed to a higher cost of living, reduced business investment, and a sharp decline in fundraising from initial public offerings. While recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of England and new trade deals offer some hope, business leaders emphasize the need for stronger growth-focused policies to restore London's competitive edge and attract entrepreneurial talent.

The change follows public pressure and accusations that authorities were withholding details in sensitive cases, such as the alleged sexual assault of a child by two men reported to be asylum seekers.

A new study published in PNAS created a computer model incorporating the Sagaing Fault's history, or "memory effect," to better understand its behavior.

          <p>Canadian farmers are facing a severe crisis after China imposed preliminary anti-dumping duties of 75.8% on canola seed imports, escalating a year-long trade dispute. The move has caused grain buyers to halt purchases, leaving farmers concerned about selling their crops as harvest season approaches. China is Canada's largest market for canola seed, with exports valued at nearly C$4 billion in 2024, and the steep tariffs are expected to effectively end this trade. The timing is particularly damaging for farmers who need to sell their crops quickly to cover significant operational costs incurred on credit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural analysis suggests that modern soccer design, from the 2026 World Cup logo to new club crests, is increasingly losing its unique edge in favor of a bland, corporate look. The article contrasts the generic feel of recent designs with the iconic, culturally-infused work of Lance Wyman for the 1968 Mexico Olympics. While designers like Matthew Wolff have created well-received, elegant crests for many U.S. clubs, the overall trend is influenced by marketing committees and focus groups that push for safer, more adaptable designs. This shift, the article argues, can rob a brand of the distinct character and artistic wonkiness that creates a lasting identity.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel is deliberately targeting and killing journalists in Gaza with impunity, pointing to the recent killing of six media workers in a tent, including Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif. The author contends that Israel has a pattern of baselessly accusing journalists of terrorism to justify attacks, noting that 184 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the war began. The piece criticizes the muted response from the international community and journalism organizations, which it claims has emboldened Israel. This lack of accountability, the author warns, risks closing the world's already limited window into the conflict in Gaza.</p>

Legal experts note that deploying troops for domestic law enforcement without a governor's request or a major crisis is highly unusual and raises concerns about authoritarianism. The issue is particularly salient for Los Angeles, which is preparing to host the 2028 Olympics and has already been a site of controversial federal deployments.</p>
