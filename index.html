          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. Endorsed by prominent progressives, she will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in the special general election on September 23. The district is heavily Democratic, and while the seat will not shift control of the House, its filling is one of three special elections this fall expected to narrow the slim Republican majority. Grijalva's platform focuses on upholding democracy, immigrant rights, and protecting social programs.</p>

          <p>The UK government is under fire for a 2022 data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had assisted British forces. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that previous Conservative ministers have "serious questions to answer" regarding the breach and a subsequent super-injunction that prevented media reporting. The injunction was recently lifted, revealing a secret £850 million resettlement scheme for those affected. While many have been relocated, hundreds of individuals whose data was leaked are believed to still be in Afghanistan, facing potential danger.</p>

Founded in 2021 and backed by major tech conglomerates, the company is considered one of China's "AI Tigers" and holds a valuation of $1.2 billion. The move follows reports of a potential Hong Kong IPO by its rival, Zhipu AI, indicating a trend of Chinese AI firms seeking public listings.

          <p>New data from Germany's Federal Statistics Office reveals a significant increase in the number of people living alone, now accounting for 20.6% of the population, or 17 million people. This figure is up from 17.1% two decades ago and is notably higher than the EU average. The trend is most pronounced among those over 65 and young adults aged 25-34. While single-person households are the most common type in Germany, the report also highlights associated downsides, including higher rates of loneliness, particularly among the young, and an increased risk of poverty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The influencer industry is facing significant challenges due to economic turbulence, as both audiences and brands become more cautious with their spending. Recession fears and declining consumer confidence have led to backlash against ostentatious content and a reduction in brand advertising budgets for creators. This shift is forcing influencers to adapt, with some pivoting towards content focused on underconsumption and financial savviness. Marketing experts suggest that while the industry may shrink, creators who innovate and provide genuine value will likely weather the economic storm and maintain their audiences.</p>

          <p>The article provides expert guidance on choosing between certificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts for savings, especially in a fluctuating interest rate environment. Experts note that CDs are ideal for specific, timed financial goals, as they lock in a fixed interest rate and protect against rate drops, but penalize early withdrawals. In contrast, money market accounts offer greater liquidity and flexibility, making them suitable for emergency funds, though their variable rates can fall. The choice depends on an individual's savings goals, timeline, and need for access to their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professional cycling teams in the 2025 Tour de France are widely adopting heat training as a key strategy to boost performance. This method involves deliberately raising a rider's core body temperature, either actively through intense exercise in warm clothing or passively in a sauna or hot bath. Sports scientists explain that this stressor can increase blood volume and stimulate red blood cell formation, similar to altitude training, but potentially more effective for a wider range of athletes. This technique, once considered unconventional, is now a mainstream tool for gaining a competitive edge in endurance sports.</p>

          <p>Total mortgage application volume in the U.S. plummeted by 10% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The decline was driven by a rise in mortgage rates, which followed an increase in Treasury yields amid renewed concerns over tariffs and the economy's direction. Applications for home purchases dropped 12% for the week, hitting their slowest pace since May, while refinancing applications fell by 7%. The data indicates that higher borrowing costs are significantly dampening activity in the housing market for both prospective buyers and current homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing has condemned Taiwan's tightened residency regulations for mainland-born spouses, vowing to punish those responsible for what it calls "discriminatory treatment." A spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office described the policy as an "illegal abuse of power" and a move by "separatists." The new enforcement under Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te requires mainland spouses who obtained identity cards before 2004 to prove they have renounced their mainland residency. This measure is part of Taipei's effort to counter what it describes as "infiltration" from mainland China.</p>

The recommendation aims to clarify their roles and avoid confusing patients, who sometimes mistake them for fully qualified doctors. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also suggests PAs should only see new patients with minor ailments and wear standardized uniforms to distinguish them from doctors.
