          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. The Chamber argues this fee is unlawful and will significantly harm American businesses, particularly startups and small-to-midsize companies, by increasing labor costs and limiting access to skilled foreign talent. While acknowledging presidential authority over non-citizen entry, the lawsuit contends the proclamation exceeds executive power and contradicts existing congressional fees. The administration defends the fee as a necessary step to reform the H-1B program and prioritize American workers.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Trump, has been indicted on 18 criminal counts, including transmitting and retaining national defense information. Prosecutors allege he shared over a thousand pages of classified "diary-like entries" with two unauthorized relatives via non-governmental email, and stored documents at his home. Bolton's lawyer denies wrongdoing, stating the records are unclassified and known to the FBI. This indictment follows previous scrutiny over his book and comes amidst charges against other Trump critics, raising questions about political motivations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced two new initiatives aimed at expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and lowering its associated costs. This includes a deal with EMD Serono, a major fertility drug manufacturer, to significantly reduce the price of certain IVF medications, which will be available on TrumpRx.gov. Additionally, the administration will issue guidance encouraging employers to offer fertility benefits to their employees, similar to vision or dental coverage. These efforts follow Trump's previous pledges to address IVF costs and accessibility, an issue that gained prominence after a controversial Alabama Supreme Court ruling on frozen embryos.</p>

          <p>Tal Shoham, a former Israeli hostage held by Hamas for over 500 days, shared his experiences, noting that some of his captors were formerly teachers, university lecturers, and doctors, describing them as "normal people becoming terrorists." He recounted instances of cruelty and starvation, surviving on minimal calories while witnessing Hamas guards steal humanitarian aid meant for Gazans. Shoham's testimony highlights the complex motivations of his captors, some driven by popular sentiment rather than religious conviction, and his personal journey of increased gratitude and faith after his ordeal. This article offers a firsthand account of the human impact of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Twenty-three states, led by California and Arizona, are suing the Trump administration over its termination of the $7 billion "Solar for All" grant program. The program, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, aimed to expand solar energy access in low-income communities. States argue the cancellation will disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities, citing a significant increase in energy bills for Arizona households and a loss of hundreds of millions in federal funds for California. The lawsuits contend that the administration's actions are misguided and unlawfully undermine clean energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed authorizing the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, an unusual public disclosure for such sensitive activities. This presidential finding could grant the agency broad authority, potentially including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or actions aimed at destabilizing the Maduro regime. While the exact parameters remain classified, historical precedents suggest such authorizations can lead to significant interventions, from funneling aid to rebels to influencing local politics. The move comes amid heightened U.S. military presence in the Caribbean and follows Trump's justification that "a lot of drugs" are flowing from Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva's swearing-in has been delayed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who cites the ongoing government shutdown. However, critics from both parties accuse Johnson of attempting to prevent Grijalva from becoming the decisive 218th signature on a petition to force a House vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein files. Grijalva, who promised to sign the petition, describes her office as non-functional due to the delay. This article highlights a contentious political standoff, raising questions about transparency and the Speaker's motivations in withholding a new member's oath of office.</p>

          <p>A network of over 340 former U.S. intelligence and national security officials, "The Steady State," has released an assessment warning that the United States is "on a trajectory" toward authoritarian rule. Applying methods used for foreign democracies, the report concludes with "moderate to high confidence" that the U.S. is moving towards "competitive authoritarianism" under the Trump administration. Indicators include expanding executive power, politicization of federal institutions, and undermining civil society and the press. The article highlights concerns about democratic backsliding and a "worrying" shift in public opinion towards strong leaders.</p>

          <p>Henry Dwight Sedgwick's 1904 short story, "The American Coup d’Etat of 1961," offers a "frightening American fable" that eerily parallels contemporary political concerns. The narrative depicts a future America under an imperial president, with a weakened Congress, economic collapse sparked by a trade war, and a chaotic election marred by fraud and violence. The story, originally a critique of early 20th-century American expansionism and corporate power, concludes with a new, equally corrupt order. This article uses the historical piece to reflect on ongoing fears about democratic fragility, executive overreach, and societal divisions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly planning to build a "Arc de Trump" triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., commemorating the country's 250th anniversary. This privately funded project is part of his broader efforts to reshape the capital, which also include a gilded White House makeover and a new ballroom. Modeled after Paris's Arc de Triomphe, the monument would be located on federal land, but faces a complex approval process requiring congressional consent and adherence to strict regulations for memorials. The article notes that such a project typically takes years, making completion by next year's anniversary unlikely.</p>

Claimants, many suffering from cancers like ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, base their case on internal memos and scientific reports.
