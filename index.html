          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain current interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting, but will likely provide updated economic forecasts that could influence market behavior. Investors will be closely watching the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) projections, particularly regarding the potential for future rate cuts and their assessment of inflation trends. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's commentary on softening labor data and the risks associated with tariff-driven inflation will also be closely scrutinized. Despite pressure from the White House for easier monetary policy, the Fed is expected to remain in a "wait-and-see" mode, carefully monitoring geopolitical developments and their potential impact on the economy.

While denying direct contact with Iranian leaders regarding a ceasefire, Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran, cautioning against any harm to U.S. troops in the region.

The agency's Community Relations Service, founded during the civil rights era, is also slated to be shuttered, eliminating all 56 positions.
