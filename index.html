          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high, driven by optimism following the International Monetary Fund's upward revision of the country's 2025 growth forecast. The positive market sentiment was further bolstered by comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary indicating that trade negotiations between the two nations were nearing completion. Gains were led by major corporations in the automotive and electronics sectors, including significant share price increases for Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, and Kia. This economic upswing occurs amidst a backdrop of broader global trade tensions, with investors closely monitoring market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has concluded that the 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible was caused by faulty engineering. The final report states the carbon fiber vessel failed to meet necessary strength requirements and that operator OceanGate did not conduct adequate testing to understand its durability. Furthermore, the investigation found that OceanGate's analysis of monitoring data was flawed, causing the company to be unaware of existing damage from a previous dive. The tragic incident, which resulted in the deaths of all five passengers, was described in a prior Coast Guard investigation as a "preventable tragedy."</p>

          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, have successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their lawsuit against the local public school district. The funds were required for a bond ordered by a federal judge to cover the district's potential legal fees if the parents lose the case. The lawsuit was filed after their sons were suspended for sexual harassment for complaining about a transgender student using the boys' locker room. The case has drawn national attention and support from conservative legal groups, highlighting the ongoing cultural and legal debates surrounding transgender student rights in schools.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given assurances that India will cease its purchases of Russian oil, although a specific timeline for this action remains unclear. Trump stated that the halt would involve "a little bit of a process" but framed it as a significant step in isolating Moscow over its war in Ukraine. India is currently one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, a point of contention in its relationship with Washington. The development, if it materializes, could have a substantial impact on global energy markets and geopolitical alignments.</p>

          <p>China's major airlines, including Air China, have officially filed their opposition to a U.S. government proposal that would prevent them from flying over Russian airspace on routes to America. The carriers argue the restriction would cause significant disruption for thousands of passengers, particularly during the upcoming holiday season. Air China has requested a grace period of at least 60 days if the proposal is enacted to allow for rebooking and operational adjustments. This dispute adds to the escalating trade and geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, impacting international travel and commerce.</p>

The guest list included leaders from top tech firms like Apple, Google, and Meta, as well as representatives from the cryptocurrency, tobacco, and energy industries. The administration has stated the 90,000-square-foot expansion will be funded entirely by private donations rather than taxpayer money. The project is part of a series of renovations Trump has undertaken since returning to office, which have drawn both praise for the upgrades and criticism for the fundraising methods.</p>

          <p>Amid a significant postseason slump, Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice to work on his swing.

Manager Dave Roberts has expressed that the team cannot win a World Series with Ohtani performing at this level. In response, Ohtani acknowledged the pressure, stating his belief that if he improves his hitting, the team will win, signaling his commitment to turning his performance around.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from two major unions after over 4,000 workers received termination notices. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" during a shutdown and cited President Trump's own social media posts suggesting the cuts were politically motivated to target programs favored by Democrats. The decision provides temporary relief for affected workers as the legal battle over the administration's authority continues amidst the government funding impasse.</p>

This widespread evasion raises serious concerns among legal experts about the ability to assemble a jury of one's peers and ensure fair trials.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new policy requiring a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B visa application is causing significant disruption for small businesses and venture-backed startups. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the high cost is slowing down hiring and shrinking the available talent pool for highly specialized roles, particularly in fields like artificial intelligence. While the policy is intended to prioritize American workers, it poses a major hurdle for smaller companies that rely on international talent. As a result, some businesses are exploring alternatives like upskilling their current workforce and building stronger recruiting ties with American universities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of six foreign nationals from different countries for making incendiary social media comments that celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The department stated that the U.S. has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death upon Americans and is continuing to identify other visa holders who praised the killing. This action is part of a broader administration crackdown on such comments, which also includes sidelining military and Secret Service personnel for similar posts. The move raises unresolved legal questions about the government's power to revoke visas based on speech.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A housing association in the UK has proposed a new model to help the government empty expensive asylum hotels by moving applicants into social housing. The plan involves providing funds to councils and housing associations to purchase more properties, which would first be offered to existing social housing tenants. The homes vacated by those tenants would then be used for asylum seekers, a strategy projected to cut accommodation costs from £54,000 to £4,000 per person annually. The proposal aims to create a more sustainable and cost-effective solution while also increasing the nation's overall social housing stock.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is imperative, particularly to protect children online. Her comments come as individual states like California, Utah, and Texas begin to enact their own AI-related safeguards in the absence of a national standard. Blackburn, a proponent of the Kid's Online Safety Act, argued that Congress must act to create a preemptive federal law to ensure consumer privacy and safety. She emphasized the need to protect personal data from being used to train AI models without consent and to establish rules for how AI can use a person's name, image, or likeness.</p>

          <p>A massive legal claim has been filed in the UK against Johnson & Johnson, with 3,000 people alleging the company knowingly sold baby powder contaminated with asbestos, leading to cancer. The lawsuit, which could become the largest product liability case in British history, cites internal documents suggesting the company was aware of the contamination as early as the 1960s but failed to warn consumers. Johnson & Johnson vehemently denies the allegations, stating its talc-based powder was safe, did not contain asbestos, and complied with all regulatory standards. The company stopped selling the product in the UK in 2023.</p>

The group's armed wing claimed that recovering the other bodies from the ruins of Gaza requires significant time and specialized equipment. This development creates a potential complication in the ceasefire deal, which requires Hamas to return all 28 dead hostages in the first phase.
