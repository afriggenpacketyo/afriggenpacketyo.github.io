        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths experienced a significant drop in 2024, with 30,000 fewer fatalities compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded, according to the CDC. While this decrease is a positive development, overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, particularly among individuals aged 18-44. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use patterns, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money. Despite these gains, concerns persist that potential reductions in federal funding and public health workforce could impede further progress in combating the overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior when it was changed to Max. The company cites a focus on quality programming and storytelling as the reason for reverting to the original name, aiming to emphasize high-quality content over a vast quantity. This shift comes as Warner Bros. Discovery seeks to improve profitability in its streaming business, which has seen significant growth in subscribers. The move mirrors a similar strategy by Disney, which is also prioritizing quality content in the streaming market.</p>

          <p>According to a New York Times news analysis, President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials believe they are gaining an advantage in the war in Ukraine, leading them to adopt a more aggressive stance in cease-fire negotiations. Despite costly and incremental gains, Russia is demanding significant concessions from Ukraine, including limitations on its military and control over annexed territories. The Trump administration faces the challenge of convincing Putin that improved relations with the United States would be more beneficial than continued military advances. The article suggests that any progress in negotiations hinges on altering Putin's perception of the situation and potential benefits.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to revise drinking water limits on certain PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," while upholding standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be reconsidered, along with a limit on a mixture of several PFAS types. The EPA will maintain the 4 parts per trillion standards for PFOA and PFOS but extend the compliance deadline for utilities to 2031. While health advocates criticize the move as illegal, water utilities support the decision, citing the high costs of treatment systems and arguing that the EPA lacked authority to regulate PFAS mixtures.</p>

Gold can provide portfolio diversification and stability, acting as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, investors should be mindful of the nuances of each gold type, such as physical gold bars, gold coins, and gold ETFs, and understand their associated risks and tax implications (not investment advice).</p>

The Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) warns that most of the UK will experience below-normal river levels in May, raising the risk of drought and water restrictions for households, farmers, and businesses. Farmers are already irrigating crops earlier than usual, and wildfires have affected a larger area of the UK compared to previous years.

          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Donald Trump's tax bill, including trillions of dollars in tax breaks, through the Ways and Means Committee. The legislation proposes raising the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, but the final limit remains uncertain. While some lawmakers prioritize a higher SALT deduction, the current $10,000 cap helped fund the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The bill could face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The FDA is initiating a scientific review of ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children, aiming to remove them from the market. The agency cites concerns that ingested fluoride may alter the gut microbiome and has been linked to thyroid disorders and decreased IQ, but dental experts largely disagree with this assessment. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has long questioned fluoride's safety, while dental professionals emphasize its effectiveness in preventing cavities. The FDA's action comes after Kennedy's call to end community water fluoridation.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that a growing number of Americans do not earn enough to afford a basic standard of living, which includes not only necessities but also technology, education, and healthcare. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that the bottom 60% of U.S. households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, need $67,000 to afford a minimal quality of life. The report suggests that traditional economic indicators do not reflect the lived reality of many Americans, as the cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001.</p>
