          <p>A senior judge from Uganda's High Court, who also worked for the United Nations, has been sentenced to over six years in prison by a UK court for enslaving a young Ugandan woman. The judge, Lydia Mugambe, was found guilty of exploiting a PhD law student at Oxford University, preventing her from finding work and forcing her to work as a maid and provide childcare. The victim reported living in constant fear and expressed concerns about returning to Uganda due to the judge's influence. The judge showed no remorse and tried to forcibly blame the younger woman, according to the court.</p>

          <p>A ship named Conscience carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, was damaged by explosions and fire off the coast of Malta, with the group suspecting a drone attack. The ship was en route to Gaza to challenge the Israeli and Egyptian blockade and was scheduled to pick up additional passengers in Malta, including Greta Thunberg. The group suggested an Israeli drone strike was responsible, though this could not be independently confirmed. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while the Maltese government confirmed the fire and the safety of the crew after a tugboat extinguished the blaze.</p>

Harry expressed concerns about bringing his family back to the UK due to these security issues, noting the potential risks and impact on his wife, children, and father. He mentioned being cut off from his father, King Charles, due to the security dispute, emphasizing the importance of family and reconciliation, especially considering his father's health. The prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year calls for $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. While budget proposals are essentially wish-list for the administration, they serve to illustrate the president's priorities and what the White House hopes is a jumping off point for negotiations with Congress. The budget also proposes a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion for the southern border. Critics argue that the cuts would severely impact programs relied on by many Americans, while supporters commend the focus on homeland security and veterans.</p>

          <p>Reform UK made significant gains in recent local elections, securing its first Parliamentary by-election victory in Runcorn and Helsby and winning mayoral contests in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull & East Yorkshire. Labour retained mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, though their vote share decreased in these races, with Reform UK emerging as a close second. The Conservatives experienced substantial losses, while the Liberal Democrats increased their overall number of seats and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire councils. These election results reflect a shift in the political landscape, with Reform UK gaining traction and challenging the dominance of traditional parties.</p>

The CDC estimates at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations, and 26,000 deaths overall from the flu this season, and data is still preliminary and may change. Experts attribute the severity of this season to lower flu vaccination rates among children, which have fallen from 64% five years ago to 49% this season.

          <p>TikTok has been fined â‚¬530 million ($602 million) by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for violating EU privacy rules by transferring European users' personal data to China. The investigation found that TikTok failed to ensure that European users' data accessed by staff in China was afforded the same level of protection as guaranteed within the EU. TikTok plans to appeal the fine, asserting that it has never received a request from Chinese authorities for European users' data. This is the second-largest fine ever imposed by the EU under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a surge in measles cases, reaching the highest level in 15 years, with a significant outbreak in West Texas leading to multiple deaths. Cases have been reported in numerous states, and health officials attribute the rise to lower vaccination rates. Measles is highly contagious and can cause severe complications, but the MMR vaccine is considered safe and effective.

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 index has achieved a record-breaking winning streak, rising for fifteen consecutive days, while global markets face turbulence due to U.S. tariff policies. Analysts attribute the rise to the UK's neutral trade status, defensive giants drawing investors, and robust corporate results. The FTSE 100's upward momentum could continue if defensive stocks remain in favor, although risks such as geopolitical hotspots and a firmer pound could impact momentum. However, undervaluation relative to the FTSE 100's global peers combined with expectations of multiple interest rate cuts from the Bank of England this year, could push the index as high as 8,900 points by the end of next month.</p>
