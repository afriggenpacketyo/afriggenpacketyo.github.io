        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological findings in Pompeii reveal that some survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live in the devastated area. Evidence suggests the formation of an informal settlement where people lived in precarious conditions, converting former ground floors into cellars with ovens and mills. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the city was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event. The findings provide a clearer picture of post-eruption life, which had been previously overlooked by researchers.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that Americans derive an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. The study, conducted between August 2021 and August 2023, found that consumption was even higher among young people, at 61.9%. These foods, often low in fiber and high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats, have been linked by previous research to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other adverse health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with earnings per share falling short of Wall Street expectations while revenue exceeded them. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and growth at Tim Hortons, which helped offset a 1.4% decline in same-store sales for its Popeyes brand. Burger King saw modest growth, particularly in its U.S. division, which is undergoing a multi-year turnaround focused on restaurant renovations and marketing.</p>

          <p>One of California's most powerful labor groups, the California Federation of Labor Unions, has endorsed a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts. This move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a strategic effort to counter potential Republican gains in other states, particularly Texas, ahead of the midterm elections. The proposal would temporarily allow state lawmakers to influence district boundaries for the next three election cycles if Texas reconfigures its own maps to favor Republicans.</p>

The author argues that the resulting hunger crisis has failed to weaken Hamas and has instead strengthened the group's negotiating position. Furthermore, the policy has severely damaged Israel's international standing, alienating key allies like the U.S. and prompting some Western nations to support Palestinian statehood, ultimately playing into Hamas's long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>Shares of Eli Lilly plummeted over 14% despite the company reporting strong second-quarter earnings that beat expectations. The sharp decline was triggered by disappointing late-stage trial data for its experimental daily weight-loss pill, orforglipron, which did not meet the high weight-loss benchmarks anticipated by investors. This outcome has clouded the company's outlook, leading to a stock downgrade and renewed concerns among investors about its ability to dominate the competitive GLP-1 obesity drug market.

Over 43% of investors polled now hold a negative outlook on the stock market for the next six months. However, some market strategists interpret this widespread pessimism as a contrarian bullish signal, suggesting that high levels of investor caution mean there is more cash on the sidelines available to fuel a future market rally.</p>

          <p>In Indian-administered Kashmir, police have conducted raids on bookstores after the government banned 25 books, including one by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. The government claims the banned materials promote secessionism and misguide the youth.
