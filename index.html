          <p>Authorities are searching for a 27-year-old man, Anmol Bhatia, who allegedly broke into his former West Hollywood apartment and beat his ex-roommate's dog to death. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department stated the incident, which was captured on surveillance video, occurred after Bhatia had been kicked out of the residence. The footage reportedly shows a masked man entering the apartment and attacking the small dog until it was motionless. Investigators also believe the suspect stole several items from the home before fleeing the scene.</p>

The White House confirmed that the new company's seven-seat board will have six American members and that Oracle will control U.S. data and the app's algorithm, addressing national security concerns that prompted the forced sale.</p>

          <p>A segment on "CBS Sunday Morning" reflected on the historic Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka case, which legally dismantled the doctrine of "separate but equal" in American public schools. The report highlighted Thurgood Marshall's powerful 1953 argument before the Supreme Court, where he asserted that racial segregation was a deliberate system designed to perpetuate subjugation. This landmark decision marked a pivotal victory in the Civil Rights Movement, fundamentally reshaping the legal framework of equality and education in the United States.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has strongly rebuked U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner, calling his public criticism of France's policies "unacceptable" for a diplomat. Kushner had published a letter accusing the French government of insufficient action against antisemitism and linking it to France's pro-Palestinian foreign policy stances. Macron stated that such public interference in domestic affairs is a breach of diplomatic protocol and that a French ambassador would never be permitted to make similar remarks. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned Kushner over the issue.</p>

          <p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland's athletics team concluded the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo without a single gold medal for the first time in 22 years. The team secured a total of five medals, matching their 2019 tally but marking their joint-lowest return since 2005. Head coach Paula Dunn described the outcome as a "mixed bag" with "missed opportunities," citing injuries to key athletes like Josh Kerr and Matthew Hudson-Smith as contributing factors. Commentators noted the disappointment, particularly the failure to win any relay medals for the first time since 2003.</p>

The article posits that as grocery prices rise and job growth stalls, public tolerance for corruption wanes, weakening Trump's hold on power. This creates a difficult calculation for collaborators like Bondi, who must weigh the benefits of pleasing the president against the future risk of prosecution, similar to Nixon's attorney general. The author argues Trump must consolidate power before potential electoral losses in 2026 remove his impunity.</p>

          <p>John Stapleton, a distinguished British television presenter known for his work on shows like the BBC's "Watchdog" and ITV's "GMTV," has died at the age of 79. His career spanned decades, beginning in local newspapers before he became a familiar face in factual and current affairs programming, reporting from global hotspots like the Falklands and Iraq. Stapleton was praised by colleagues as a versatile and brilliant broadcaster. In recent years, he had been public about his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease, which was complicated by pneumonia.</p>

          <p>Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has implemented a voluntary ban on plastic flying rings at its beaches to prevent harm to seals. The toys pose a significant danger to the marine mammals, as young, curious seals can get the hoops stuck around their necks, leading to severe injury, infection, and death. The move follows similar actions by other coastal councils and retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury's. The council is also backing a campaign for a UK-wide legislative ban on the sale of these hazardous toys.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a mutual defense pact, significantly strengthening their long-standing security partnership. Analysts suggest the move reflects a broader trend among Gulf Arab states to diversify their security relationships amid growing uncertainty about the United States as their primary guarantor. For Saudi Arabia, the pact is a way to "put its eggs in different baskets" by securing a defense commitment from Pakistan. The evolving alliance comes as geopolitical tensions rise between the U.S. and China, potentially complicating security dynamics in the region.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a key technology provider, has caused continued flight disruptions for a second day at several major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. The attack affected the company's MUSE software, which is used for passenger check-in and baggage drop systems, forcing airlines to resort to manual processing. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday departures due to the ongoing issues. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to supply chain cyber threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the recent recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada, and Australia is a significant diplomatic step, it highlights the profound challenge of who would lead such a state. Palestinian politics have been deeply fractured for years, with a major division between the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. With no elections since 2006, the current leadership is widely seen as ineffective, and the most popular potential successor, Marwan Barghouti, has been imprisoned in Israel for over two decades, complicating any path to unified governance.</p>

          <p>California's governor has signed a law that will prohibit most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents from agencies like ICE, from wearing face masks. The ban, effective January 2026, was passed in response to federal agents wearing masks during immigration raids in Los Angeles. The law includes exceptions for undercover operations, health protection, and certain tactical gear. Federal officials have criticized the law as an attempt to endanger officers, while supporters, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have framed it as a protection against "secret police" tactics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has upended the long-held theory about the origin of Stonehenge's Altar Stone, suggesting it came from Scotland, not Wales. By creating a chemical fingerprint of the six-ton sandstone block, researchers found its mineral composition matches rocks from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, over 460 miles away. This finding challenges previous research that pointed to a source in southeast Wales. The discovery raises new questions about the advanced transport methods and complex trade networks that must have existed during the Neolithic period to move such a massive stone.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has firmly rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion that the U.S. could retake Bagram Air Base. Trump had recently stated that discussions were underway with Afghanistan regarding the former U.S. military facility, which was abandoned during the chaotic 2021 withdrawal. A Taliban spokesman dismissed the claim, urging the U.S. to adhere to the Doha Agreement, which prohibits threats against Afghanistan's territorial integrity. The spokesman emphasized that the country's independence is of the utmost importance and not open to negotiation.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, showcasing a resurgent pace that could pose a late-season challenge to the McLaren team. The race was disastrous for championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who crashed out on the first lap after an ambitious overtaking attempt. His teammate and main rival, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize, finishing seventh after getting stuck in traffic. The results mean Piastri's championship lead over Norris narrows to 25 points with seven races remaining in the season.</p>

          <p>The Seabed 2030 project, a UN-backed initiative to map the entire ocean floor by the end of the decade, is struggling to meet its ambitious goal. While only 20% of the seabed has been surveyed, completing the map could reveal undiscovered ecosystems and provide vital data on climate change. However, the project faces challenges including high costs, a lack of ships and equipment, and waning political will in a more fractured geopolitical landscape. There are also concerns that a complete map could accelerate resource exploitation in largely unregulated international waters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A historical analysis draws parallels between the role of women in Nazi Germany and the rhetoric surrounding domesticity in contemporary right-wing movements. The article argues that authoritarian regimes often rely on women's unpaid labor in the home to maintain social stability and advance state ideology, framing traditional duties as a source of national strength. It highlights how Nazi Germany promoted "children, kitchen, church" through women's magazines, suggesting a similar dynamic is emerging in the digital "womanosphere," which romanticizes traditional lifestyles while conservative policies roll back women's rights.</p>
