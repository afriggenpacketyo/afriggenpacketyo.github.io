            <p>The U.S. government has unsealed an indictment against Johnny and Jose Hurtado Olascoaga, sibling leaders of La Nueva Familia Michoacana cartel, designated as a foreign terrorist organization. Authorities are offering up to $8 million in rewards for information leading to their capture, accusing them of manufacturing and distributing drugs, including fentanyl, in the U.S. The cartel is also known for using drones to drop bombs on rivals and terrorizing communities through kidnappings, killings, and extortion. The Treasury Department has announced sanctions against the brothers and other alleged cartel leaders.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates have surged to their highest levels since February, causing an overall decrease in demand and prompting homebuyers to seek riskier loan options with lower initial rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Total mortgage application volume has fallen by 8.5%, with applications for home purchases dropping by 5%. The increase in ARM share to 9.6% reflects borrowers seeking to reduce monthly payments amidst economic uncertainty and rising home prices. Experts caution that further volatility in mortgage rates is expected, making it a challenging environment for prospective buyers.</p>

            <p>New and used vehicle supplies in the U.S. are rapidly decreasing as consumers rush to purchase cars and trucks before potential tariff-related price increases take effect. Cox Automotive reports a significant drop in the days' supply of new vehicles from 91 to 70, with used vehicle supply also declining. This surge in sales is driven by concerns over tariffs on imports, potentially leading to a halt in sales once tariff-free inventories are depleted. Auto advisory firm Telemetry anticipates a reduction of up to 2 million vehicle sales annually due to rising costs and prices.</p>

            <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, China appears to be digging in its heels and preparing for a prolonged economic battle. While the U.S. imposes tariffs, China has retaliated by halting some orders with Boeing and restricting rare earth mineral exports. Chinese leaders believe they can withstand economic pain longer than the U.S., focusing on developing advanced technologies and building relationships with other countries. Experts suggest that the trade war may accelerate the shift towards a multipolar world, with China emerging as a more stable partner.</p>

            <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely anticipated to cut interest rates for the third time this year due to global tariff tensions and economic uncertainty in the euro zone. Markets are pricing in a high probability of a quarter-point interest rate cut, which would bring the ECB's deposit facility rate down to 2.25%. While the ECB previously signaled a potential pause in monetary easing, recent tariff policies have renewed concerns about euro area growth, forcing the central bank to consider further rate cuts. The ECB may also adjust its communication to reflect that a 2.25% deposit rate would now be within the range of neutral interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, citing the judge's meticulous approach to the law and appropriate sanction.

Separately, Trump threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status after the administration froze federal funding to the school. The White House claims these actions are meant to root out antisemitism on campus, but college leaders worry about further actions beyond cutting research grants.</p>

            <p>California's state Senate has achieved a majority of women for the first time, with 58 women serving across both chambers, nearing gender parity. This milestone is attributed to targeted recruiting of women for specific districts and personalized coaching. Activists realized that focused recruitment could be a game-changer, leading to a doubling of Democratic women elected to the California Legislature in the past decade. This success story highlights the importance of representation and strategic organizing to achieve parity in politics.</p>

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that the 2010 Equalities Act defines a woman as someone born biologically female. The ruling clarifies that a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate should not be considered a woman for equality purposes under the legislation. However, the court emphasized that transgender people are still protected from discrimination based on gender reassignment. The case stemmed from a 2018 Scottish law that included transgender women in its definition of women for public board representation.</p>

            <p>ASML, a critical chip firm, reported lower-than-expected net bookings for the first quarter, citing uncertainty from new U.S. trade restrictions.

Despite this, ASML maintains its 2025 revenue guidance between €30 and €35 billion. The U.S. Commerce Department is conducting a national security investigation into semiconductor technology imports, potentially leading to additional trade measures.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' unfavorable ratings have significantly increased, likely due to her handling of the January fires. A UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs survey revealed a 17-percentage-point rise in unfavorable views compared to a year ago. While the poll didn't directly link the fires, experts suggest they likely contributed to the decline. Despite the setback, there's an opportunity for Bass to regain public trust through effective recovery efforts.</p>

The disease is similar to chronic wasting disease (CWD) found in deer, raising concerns about potential transmission to humans.</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff proposals and economic uncertainty are casting a shadow over TV networks' annual upfront presentations.

The biggest fear is a potential recession, which could devastate the media business already struggling with shifting consumer habits. With uncertainty ahead, advertisers may opt for more flexible digital platforms over traditional TV's firm commitments.</p>

The move involves placing these individuals' Social Security numbers in the "Death Master File," potentially disrupting their access to financial services and benefits.
