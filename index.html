            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has kept its loan prime rates unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, focusing on stabilizing the yuan amidst trade tensions with the U.S. This decision aligns with better-than-expected economic data from China, including a 5.4% year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter, providing room for steady rates. Retail sales and industrial output numbers for March also surpassed economists' expectations, reinforcing the PBOC's decision to maintain current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," nonsexual unions driven by practical advantages like social security benefits, are gaining traction, as Satsuki and Minato, a couple in their 30s, exemplify this trend. A Tokyo-based agency has facilitated over 300 such marriages in the past decade, reflecting a growing acceptance of alternative partnerships. Despite contradicting traditional sexual orientations, these marriages offer companionship and family stability, with couples often choosing to raise children and navigate societal expectations together. This trend highlights evolving values in Japan, where same-sex marriage remains unrecognized, leading some to seek unconventional solutions for partnership and social acceptance.</p>

NHS data reveals fewer men attempt to contact their GP, register at dental practices, or use pharmacies. Concerns about appearing weak and appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns contribute to this reluctance, and a survey indicates that nearly half of men feel pressured to "tough it out" when facing health issues.</p>
