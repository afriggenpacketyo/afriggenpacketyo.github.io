          <p>In response to an extreme heatwave with temperatures expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius, German education unions are demanding uniform heat protection measures in schools nationwide. Proposals include infrastructure modernization, a universal supply of free drinking water, and specialized first aid training to handle heat-related emergencies. Concurrently, the German Hospital Federation is requesting additional funding to retrofit clinics, citing a lack of air-conditioned rooms which poses a risk to both patients and staff. These calls for action highlight the growing challenges posed by climate change on public infrastructure and safety in Germany.</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cultural relevance. This involves creating AI systems tailored to local languages and contexts, rather than relying on English-based models from major tech companies. Experts highlighted open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing as key tools for democratizing AI and empowering nations to build their own technological infrastructure. The discussion pointed to the digitally savvy ASEAN region as particularly well-positioned to pioneer this movement, fostering inclusive growth and local innovation.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers saw a surprising return to growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, largely driven by a boost in production and new orders from promotional activities. This result contrasts with the official government PMI, which indicated a third consecutive month of contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey timing and company focus. Despite the production growth, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, signaling potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats are using the "vote-a-rama" to force votes on controversial amendments, while GOP leadership works to secure support from holdouts for the final passage.

          <p>Two tropical systems have developed on Mexico's coasts, bringing heavy rainfall to the region. In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Flossie strengthened into a hurricane on Monday night but is expected to remain offshore, moving parallel to the coast while still causing significant rainfall in several states. Meanwhile, on the Atlantic coast, Tropical Storm Barry made landfall as a tropical depression and was rapidly weakening as it moved inland over eastern Mexico. Forecasters warned that both storms would continue to produce drenching rains and potential flooding across large areas of the country through the beginning of the week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to withhold an estimated $6.8 billion in federal education funds that Congress had already appropriated for the current fiscal year. The freeze impacts programs supporting teacher training, after-school activities, English learners, and children of migrant families, with California alone set to lose over $800 million. State education officials expressed alarm, stating the sudden halt to funding is illegal and will cause immediate harm to students and school systems that have already hired staff based on these expected funds. The administration's justification aligns with its budget proposal to eliminate or slash these same programs, citing a need to restore state oversight.</p>

The lawmakers argue that recent widespread ICE raids are creating fear and disrupting key industries like construction and hospitality by targeting non-criminal workers. They contend that these tactics are exacerbating labor shortages and harming local economies and communities. The letter also calls for an expansion of legal guest worker programs and a modernized immigration system to provide a legal pathway for long-term, non-criminal residents.</p>

The sanctions, which bar Tolentino from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, were enacted in response to what China called his "egregious conduct on China-related issues." Tolentino was a principal author of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, which formally asserts Manila's claims in the disputed South China Sea.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law major housing legislation designed to accelerate construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews and also streamline the process for other developments like health clinics and child-care facilities. Newsom forced the legislation through by tying its passage to the state budget, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor groups. Experts believe these are the most significant reforms to CEQA in decades and could unlock numerous stalled housing projects across the state.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers along the coast of northern and central Portugal were treated to a rare and spectacular weather phenomenon on Sunday amidst a regional heatwave. Many observers captured images and videos of a massive, tube-shaped "roll cloud" stretching across the sky. This type of low-level, horizontal cloud is formally known as an arcus cloud and is relatively uncommon. It typically forms along the leading edge of a thunderstorm or cold front, creating a dramatic visual display for those fortunate enough to witness it. The event provided a surprising and amazing sight for people seeking relief from the high temperatures.</p>

The two deceased firefighters were identified as Battalion Chief Frank Harwood and Battalion Chief John Morrison. The suspect's body was later found at the scene with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and while a motive remains unknown, the sheriff noted Roley had previously expressed interest in becoming a firefighter.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a significant internal rebellion over its proposed changes to the welfare system, particularly concerning the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) disability benefit. Despite holding a large majority, the government is engaged in a major persuasion effort to win over dozens of its own MPs who are concerned the reforms will harm vulnerable people. Critics argue that a planned review of the benefit will conclude too late to influence the new, stricter eligibility criteria set to take effect in late 2026. The controversy highlights deep divisions within the party over balancing fiscal responsibility with social support.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a key messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms that link physical exercise to longevity. The study suggests that it may be possible to develop anti-aging strategies that simulate the beneficial effects of exercise by targeting this pathway.</p>
