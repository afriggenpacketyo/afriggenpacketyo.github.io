          <p>A man shouting "free Palestine" attacked a pro-Israel gathering at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, injuring six people with Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower. The FBI is investigating the incident as a suspected act of terrorism, identifying the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, sustained burns, some serious, during the weekly demonstration held by Run for Their Lives, a group supporting Israeli hostages in Gaza. Footage showed a chaotic scene with smoke, people running, and injuries on the ground as the suspect was taken into custody.</p>

          <p>Despite projections of slowing global GDP growth, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts improved profitability for the aviation industry in 2025. Revenue, operating profits, and net profits are all expected to increase, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. The industry's net profit margin is projected to rise to 3.7%, with total revenues reaching a record high of $979 billion. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high of 84%, although fleet expansion faces challenges due to aerospace sector supply chain issues. (not investment advice)</p>

The election results mark a turnaround from initial exit polls, which had projected Trzaskowski as the winner. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. This outcome is likely to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, giving them renewed hope for the 2027 parliamentary elections.</p>

This term is used by investors to describe Trump's tendency to announce tariffs, causing market fluctuations, and then retract them. Enten noted that the rising association of 'TACO' with Trump is "troubling" for the president, as it undermines his image of decisiveness.

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with illegal voting at the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote in the 2024 general election while attending the university. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different Chinese passport. He is now federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, although the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the distribution of bonuses from participating in the Club World Cup, wearing shirts reading "Club World Ca$h Grab." The MLS Players Association expressed solidarity, stating that FIFA's new tournament increases player workload without regard to their well-being. FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts to participate, but the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team.</p>

          <p>A report by Universities UK warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as financial challenges lead to course cutbacks. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recognizes the financial problems facing universities and aims to support collaboration where possible. The report suggests greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient. However, legal advice has prevented universities from consulting each other on the impact of course closures, hindering collaboration.</p>
