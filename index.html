        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the price of package holidays increasing, many UK travelers are finding innovative ways to save money. The article highlights several personal stories, including booking last-minute deals, traveling off-peak, and finding "kids go free" packages to significantly cut expenses. Other methods discussed include home-swapping for accommodation, using credit card loyalty points for flights, and opting for house-sitting to eliminate lodging costs entirely. These strategies demonstrate a shift towards more resourceful travel planning to combat rising costs.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 05:24:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Health Secretary and the British Medical Association (BMA) are scheduled to meet next week to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The dispute centers on pay, with doctors arguing that a proposed 5.4% increase is insufficient to restore real-terms pay levels from 2008. While the government states it cannot improve the offer, it is reportedly open to discussing better working conditions. The potential strike raises concerns about its impact on patient care and NHS waiting lists, as public support for the industrial action has reportedly declined.</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, marking a tragic development in a recent surge of the virus. The hospital has seen a significant increase in children seriously ill with measles, with 17 treated since June. Health officials attribute the spike to a decline in MMR vaccine uptake, emphasizing the vaccine's safety and effectiveness over its 50-year history. This is believed to be only the second measles-related child death in the UK in a decade, highlighting the severe risks of the highly contagious illness.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reaffirmed his country's "unconditional support" for Russia's actions in Ukraine during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. This statement underscores the deepening military and political alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang. According to reports, North Korea has already supplied Russia with millions of artillery shells and missiles and sent thousands of troops and military engineers to the Kursk region. In return, Pyongyang is reportedly receiving economic cooperation and military technology, solidifying a partnership that alarms Western nations.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a compelling showdown between the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, renewing a rivalry that is defining modern tennis. The match comes just weeks after their classic five-set French Open final, which Alcaraz won. Having won the last six Grand Slam titles between them, their duopoly and contrasting styles—Sinner's cool composure versus Alcaraz's expressive energy—are drawing comparisons to historic rivalries. Alcaraz seeks his third consecutive Wimbledon title, while Sinner aims for his first, promising another gripping chapter.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old farmworker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, has died after being taken off life support following a fall from a greenhouse roof during an immigration raid at a Ventura County cannabis operation. His family claims he was fleeing federal agents, while the Department of Homeland Security stated he was not being pursued.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the West must urgently confront the possibility of Ukraine's collapse, as its forces are exhausted and outgunned while Russian attacks escalate and US support wavers. The author posits that a Ukrainian defeat would represent a monumental strategic failure for the West, with dire consequences for European security, the transatlantic alliance, and international law. The piece criticizes the inadequacy of current Western military aid and the unreliability of Donald Trump's position. It calls for tougher actions, including sanctions and expropriating Russian assets, to prevent a catastrophic outcome.</p>

          <p>China's central government has become involved in the investigation into a lead poisoning case at a kindergarten in Gansu province, indicating the seriousness of the incident. The provincial government announced that a high-level task force, including the party chief and governor, will lead the probe alongside experts from national ministries and the State Council. The scandal emerged after parents had their children tested in another province, revealing the poisoning that local tests had missed. Authorities suspect the kindergarten used inedible, lead-based paint to color food and have detained eight people.</p>

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant political shift marked by the growing influence of conservative Islamic parties, posing a challenge to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's moderate coalition. The opposition Perikatan Nasional, which includes the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial ground, particularly among younger and more conservative Malay voters. This "green wave" is pushing for policies aligned with a conservative Islamic ideology in the states it governs. This trend reflects deep-seated societal tensions and could reshape the political landscape of the multi-ethnic, Muslim-majority nation.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing data from two existing Chinese dams upstream on the Brahmaputra River suggests that China's new mega dam in Tibet might not cause the droughts in India that many fear. The research, based on hydrological measurements since 2014, found that the existing dams have actually increased water flow during the dry season. Low flows in February were up by more than 50%, significantly raising water levels throughout the typically dry period. This evidence counters widespread concerns in India that Beijing's dam-building activities would lead to a water crisis downstream.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, Florida lawmakers have toured the "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades. The visit follows claims from detainees about inhumane conditions, such as extreme heat, small food portions, and a lack of clean water. Democratic lawmakers, who had to sue for access, described the conditions as "appalling," noting high temperatures and reports that drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the facility expressed satisfaction. The state has denied the accusations, but Democrats are calling for hearings.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have voiced strong disappointment over U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. The EU's chief threatened "proportionate countermeasures" if the tariffs are enacted, while Mexico called the move an "unfair deal" but expressed hope for a negotiated agreement. President Trump has warned he will escalate tariffs further if either trading partner retaliates. The move is part of a broader tariff strategy that also targets other nations, creating significant friction and uncertainty in global trade relationships.</p>
