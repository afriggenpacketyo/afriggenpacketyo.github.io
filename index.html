          <p>A federal jury in Florida has convicted Ryan Routh on all five charges related to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at his golf course in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself, was apprehended after a Secret Service agent spotted him with a rifle before he could fire any shots. Following the verdict, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen in the courtroom before being subdued by U.S. marshals. He now faces a potential life sentence for the attack, which was the second assassination attempt against Trump during the 2024 campaign season.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, some homeowners are considering using a home equity loan to purchase a second property. This article explores the key factors to evaluate before making such a decision, including the broader interest rate climate and how much equity is available. It also emphasizes the importance of aligning this financial move with long-term goals, as leveraging a primary residence as collateral carries significant risks. While lower rates make borrowing cheaper, a careful calculation of costs and benefits is advised to avoid potential foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with top congressional Democrats Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, increasing the likelihood of a federal government shutdown. The meeting was intended to negotiate a funding deal ahead of the September 30 deadline. Trump cited what he called "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democrats as the reason for the cancellation, particularly their insistence on including protections for Affordable Care Act tax credits. Democratic leaders accused Trump of political posturing and stated that he will be responsible for any resulting shutdown.</p>

          <p>During his address at the United Nations, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva strongly criticized Washington's policies on tariffs and military actions while advocating for closer ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected diplomatic overture shortly after the speech. Trump told reporters that he and Lula had "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter and announced they had agreed to meet the following week. This development comes amid heightened tensions, including significant U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports, making the proposed meeting a surprising turn of events.</p>

          <h2>NYC Mayoral Candidate Criticizes High Cost of World Cup Final Tickets</h2>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has publicly criticized the high ticket prices for the upcoming World Cup, calling the projected $6,000 face value for the final match at MetLife Stadium "absurd." Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, contrasted this with the 1994 World Cup in the U.S., where final tickets cost under $200 in today's dollars. He is advocating for FIFA to set aside 15% of tickets at discounted prices for local residents and to abandon its dynamic pricing model, which adjusts costs based on demand. The pricing strategy has drawn backlash from soccer fans concerned about being priced out of the event.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Noni Madueke is expected to be out of action for six to eight weeks after sustaining a knee injury during a recent match against Manchester City. The 23-year-old winger, who was signed from Chelsea over the summer, was substituted at halftime. While the club does not believe it is an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, the recovery timeline represents a significant setback for both Arsenal and the England national team. The injury will cause Madueke to miss several key domestic and European fixtures, as well as upcoming international matches, with a potential return in November.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the combination of a recent increase in inflation and a slowdown in hiring presents a "challenging situation" for the central bank. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell noted that downside risks to employment have grown, which influenced the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates. However, he also expressed concern about the high uncertainty surrounding the future path of inflation, creating a difficult balancing act for policymakers. The economic conditions, sometimes referred to as "stagflation," put the Fed in a bind as it navigates its dual mandate of controlling prices and maximizing employment.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of the recent controversy surrounding FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's threats against Disney-owned ABC and its host Jimmy Kimmel. While Carr suggested revoking broadcast licenses, historical precedent and First Amendment protections make such an action highly unlikely and legally difficult. The article argues that Carr's real leverage lies not in license revocation but in the FCC's power to approve or deny major media mergers and acquisitions. This regulatory power creates a strong incentive for companies like Nexstar and Sinclair, which preempted Kimmel's show, to stay in the chairman's good graces as they pursue their own expansion deals.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump criticized the organization's headquarters, recounting his own failed bid years ago to manage its renovation. He claimed he could have completed the project for far less money and with superior materials like marble and mahogany instead of the "plastic" used. Trump also complained about technical malfunctions he experienced, including a non-working teleprompter and an escalator that stopped while he was on it. These personal grievances were woven into a broader critique where he accused the UN of producing only "empty words" and failing to live up to its potential.</p>

This move, which follows years of testing in the minor leagues, is expected to increase accuracy and potentially reduce on-field arguments and ejections related to ball and strike calls.</p>

          <p>This article explains the Medigap "birthday rule," a provision in about 18 states that allows Medicare beneficiaries to switch their supplemental insurance plans annually without medical underwriting. This rule provides a specific window around a person's birthday during which they can move to a different Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits, and insurers cannot deny them or charge more due to pre-existing conditions. For seniors, this can offer significant financial flexibility, allowing them to escape high-premium plans and choose more affordable options as their needs and budgets change over time.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the transnational gang Barrio 18 as a foreign terrorist organization. The department stated the group, one of the largest in the Northern Hemisphere, has conducted attacks on officials, security forces, and civilians in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This designation places Barrio 18 on a list with other criminal groups like MS-13 and major drug cartels. The Trump administration has increasingly used this classification, historically reserved for politically motivated groups like al Qaeda, to target criminal organizations and justify actions against their operations.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a massive aircraft order from China may be imminent as part of broader trade negotiations with the U.S., strengthening the investment case for Boeing. U.S. officials in Beijing have indicated that negotiations for a significant jet order are in their final stages. This potential deal follows a pattern where countries seeking to reduce trade deficits with the U.S. have made large purchases from Boeing. Cramer notes that recent orders from the Middle East, Japan, and Korea, coupled with the promising China talks, make the company's stock an attractive buy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell strongly defended the central bank's independence, dismissing claims that its decisions are politically motivated as a "cheap shot." While not mentioning him by name, the comments were a clear rebuttal to President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell and the Fed for not lowering interest rates more aggressively. The defense comes amid an ongoing campaign by the White House to increase its influence over the Fed's board. Powell reiterated that the Fed's decisions are driven by economic data as it navigates the dual challenges of rising inflation and a weakening labor market.</p>

Originally conceived as a clunky, museum-based installation, the project has been updated by PulseJet Studios for modern, all-in-one headsets like the Apple Vision Pro. The experience places the user in an austere Icelandic landscape where they can interact with visual representations of the music's themes, such as stitching together Björk's broken heart.

          <p>According to a new report from CDC scientists, U.S. infection rates from highly drug-resistant bacteria, known as "nightmare bacteria," increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers warn that these once-rare infections are becoming more common, potentially leading to the community spread of untreatable illnesses. The increase is believed to be partly linked to a surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the evolution of resistant germs.</p>

On the war in Gaza, he insisted that recognizing a Palestinian state would encourage conflict and that the world's focus should be solely on demanding the release of hostages held by Hamas.

While $300,000 of the payment must be donated to charity, the remaining $200,000 is a stipend, creating what some see as a mercenary perception. European captain Luke Donald highlighted that his team unanimously rejected the option of being paid, reinforcing the narrative that they play for pride and tradition.
