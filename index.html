          <p>Peter Coker Jr. was sentenced to 40 months in prison for his role in a $100 million New Jersey deli fraud scheme, while his father, Peter Coker Sr., received six months in jail and six months of home confinement. Coker Jr.'s lawyer cited his time in a Thai prison and health issues, including severe cirrhosis, as factors for leniency. The Cokers and a third man orchestrated the fraudulent inflation of share prices of two companies, including Hometown International, which owned a small, money-losing deli. </p>

Hogg claimed the vote was influenced by his efforts to reform the party, while Kenyatta expressed frustration at the focus on Hogg. The decision now goes to the entire DNC for a vote. </p>

The operation occurs amid ongoing conflict and stalled ceasefire negotiations, with Israel demanding the release of hostages. The potential death of Sinwar could impact future negotiations and Hamas's willingness to compromise. </p>

          <p>The Qatari royal family's proposal to gift President Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 has sparked controversy and ethical concerns. While presidents often receive gifts, the scale of this offering raises questions about potential influence and conflicts of interest. Experts note that such a gift could violate the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and raises concerns about Qatar's motives. The situation is further complicated by the Trump Organization's deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar, highlighting the need for transparency and scrutiny regarding the president's financial ties. </p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs Remain High Despite Lower Inflation Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of high tariffs, inflation slowed in April, leading to questions about the immediate economic impact. Experts suggest that companies had stocked up on foreign goods before the tariffs took effect, delaying price increases. However, analysts predict that consumer prices will eventually rise as companies deplete their inventories. While a potential trade agreement with China could alleviate some concerns, the risk of disrupted supply chains and shortages remains, potentially leading to an inflationary cycle. </p>
