          <p>Reddit has initiated legal action against Anthropic, an AI startup, alleging breach of contract and unfair competition due to the unauthorized use of Reddit's platform data. The lawsuit claims that Anthropic trained its AI models using personal data from Reddit users without their consent, thereby violating Reddit's user agreement. Reddit asserts that it has suffered harm from Anthropic's commercial exploitation of its content, especially considering that Reddit has partnerships with companies like OpenAI and Google, who understand and respect Reddit's data usage policies. Reddit seeks damages and an order compelling Anthropic to adhere to its contractual and legal obligations.</p>

The company's process involves repurposing industrial and water treatment waste, specifically brine, to generate clean water and capture CO2 from the air. The technology separates salt into sodium and chlorine, turning the sodium into lye, which bonds with CO2 when exposed to air. This process is particularly attractive in drought-affected areas, with Capture6 already working in Western Australia, South Korea, and California.

          <p>Despite receiving an exemption from 50% tariffs, Britain's steel industry will still be subject to a 25% duty due to the lack of a trade agreement with the United States. This situation highlights the complexities of international trade policies and their impact on specific industries. The tariffs are intended to protect domestic industries but can create challenges for international trade partners. The absence of a finalized trade deal means that British steel exports to the U.S. will continue to face some level of financial burden.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing direct talks, both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy have traded accusations, signaling a widening gap between Ukraine and Russia. The belligerent language and recent strikes indicate a lack of progress in resolving the conflict. Despite diplomatic efforts, the two countries remain far apart on key issues, with both sides blaming the other for escalating tensions.

Jean-Pierre is releasing a book that will detail the weeks leading up to Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, citing betrayal by the Democratic party. The book is expected to provide a critique of the party's support for Biden's re-election bid despite concerns about his age and health.

          <p>The 5-year rule is an IRS regulation that affects how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from an inherited annuity when the original contract owner dies. It essentially requires that the entire value of the annuity be distributed, either all at once or in multiple withdrawals, within five years of the original owner's death. This rule applies to non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax dollars and comes into play when the beneficiary is not a spouse. Understanding this rule can help beneficiaries avoid costly mistakes and ensure the money is distributed in a way that aligns with their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the film Challengers depicted an American man winning the French Open, no American man has won the trophy since 1999, and none had reached the quarter-finals since 2003. This year, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe ended the 22-year quarter-final drought for American men at Roland-Garros. Despite their progress, both players lost their quarter-final matches, highlighting the challenges American men face on clay courts. Their matches demonstrated the high level of play required on the surface and the dominance of players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.</p>

          <p>A Congressional Budget Office analysis has revealed that Donald Trump’s tax bill would add $2.4 trillion to America’s national debt over the next decade. The non-partisan budget office said that Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” would decrease federal revenues by $3.67tn while cutting spending by $1.25tn through 2034. Elon Musk has criticized the measure as a “disgusting abomination,” and Republicans are expressing concerns. The CBO analysis also found the bill would leave 10.9 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034. (not investment advice)</p>
