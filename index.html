          <p>The Chinese province of Hainan is launching a strategic initiative to become a major medical tourism hub, aiming to attract over 1.5 million domestic visitors annually by 2027. This plan is partly a response to South Korea's decision to eliminate value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery, which may diminish its competitiveness. Hainan plans to expedite the approval of new medical products and introduce at least 40 innovative international drugs and devices each year. The region has already seen a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in medical tourists in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service recommends that patients coming off obesity injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive check-ups for at least a year. This advice from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) addresses concerns that patients often regain significant weight after treatment ceases. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process requiring structured support, including healthy eating and exercise, to maintain weight loss. This comes as an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these jabs, though most are private patients.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, an Arizona woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years, have filed a lawsuit to block her imminent deportation. They argue that federal authorities are illegally using expedited removal proceedings, a process legally reserved for immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years. The case is seen as a test of the Trump administration's immigration policies, with attorneys claiming it represents a disregard for due process. Co Tupul, a single mother of three U.S. citizens, was detained during a traffic stop and placed in expedited removal after declining to answer questions about her status.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed paperwork to roll back a Biden-era policy that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the health of the mother. The administration's filing calls the existing policy "legally questionable" and claims it is out of step with congressional limits on federal funding for abortions. If finalized, the rule would significantly restrict abortion access for veterans, particularly the more than half of female veterans who live in states where the procedure is banned or heavily restricted.</p>

          <p>Shares of telehealth company Hims & Hers Health declined significantly after it reported second-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The company has also faced recent controversy over its continued sale of compounded versions of popular weight loss drugs after a collaboration with drugmaker Novo Nordisk collapsed. For its third quarter, Hims & Hers issued revenue guidance that was in line with analyst expectations but provided a lower-than-expected forecast for its adjusted earnings. The company's stock had previously tumbled after the failed partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has officially opened its market to Brazilian coffee imports, a move that comes just as the United States is set to implement a new tariff on the commodity. The U.S. is the largest global consumer of coffee and a critical market for Brazil, importing nearly a quarter of its total coffee exports in the first half of the year. The new U.S. tariff has sent shockwaves through Brazil's coffee industry, forcing exporters to urgently seek alternative markets. China's decision provides a timely new destination for Brazilian producers.</p>

          <p>A new pilot scheme between the UK and France, designed to reduce small boat crossings of the English Channel, has officially come into force. The "one-in, one-out" deal will see the UK return some migrants who arrive illegally to France. In return, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers directly from France, provided they pass security checks and have not previously attempted an illegal crossing. The Labour government hailed the plan as a product of "grown-up diplomacy," while the opposition Conservatives claimed it will make no difference.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a "substantial" tariff increase on India due to its continued purchase of oil from Russia. In a social media post, Trump criticized India for buying large amounts of Russian oil and profiting from it on the open market. This warning follows a recent 25% levy on India and escalates trade tensions. India's foreign ministry called the threat "unjustified," stating that its oil purchases from Russia helped stabilize global energy markets at the encouragement of the U.S. at the start of the Ukraine conflict.</p>

The move is described as a "good faith" effort to motivate Musk to remain focused on Tesla as it pivots to AI and robotics, especially while a previous, larger pay package of over $55 billion remains tied up in legal challenges. A Delaware judge has twice voided the 2018 plan, citing an unfair negotiation process. The board stated that if the original plan is ultimately approved, this new interim award will be rescinded to prevent double payment. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking to CBS News, Noem said she hopes to launch similar centers near airports in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana to increase detention capacity and expedite deportations. The strategy has drawn sharp criticism from legal experts who question the constitutionality of state-run immigration detention and from attorneys who cite inhumane conditions at the Florida site, which is located in the Everglades.</p>

The proposed map, which Democrats call a racist gerrymander, could add up to five new safe seats for the GOP. In response, Texas Republicans have voted to authorize civil arrest warrants to compel the absent lawmakers to return. The dramatic walkout has escalated into a national issue, with Democrats encouraging blue states like California to consider their own mid-decade redistricting in retaliation.</p>

          <p>As smoke from Canadian wildfires causes air quality alerts across the Midwest and Northeast U.S., health experts are reminding the public of the significant risks of exposure. Pulmonologists compare breathing air with a high Air Quality Index (AQI) to smoking up to half a pack of cigarettes a day, which can worsen conditions like asthma and is linked to long-term health issues. Experts advise staying indoors with windows shut, using air filters, and wearing an N95 mask if going outside is necessary, as even limited exposure can be harmful.</p>
