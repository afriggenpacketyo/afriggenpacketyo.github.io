          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new international agreement to address Iran's nuclear program, emphasizing the need for strict supervision by the IAEA. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions following recent US and Israeli strikes, warning of a potential "nuclear disaster." He positioned China as a mediator, urging all parties to negotiate and asserting that this new framework is essential for achieving peace and stability in the region.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a significant challenge at the Women's Euro 2025, having been drawn into what is considered the tournament's most difficult group alongside France and the Netherlands. With three of the four teams ranked in the world's top 11, statistical models give the group a 37% chance of producing the eventual champion. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, the formidable French team and a competitive Welsh side make progression uncertain for all involved.</p>

          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after being banned last year over a sponsorship dispute. This article frames his return not just as a sporting victory but as a complex cultural spectacle reflecting American identity, excess, and dysfunction. It explores the intense training and mindset of "elite eating" while also using the event as a satirical mirror for broader societal issues of consumption and the distorted pursuit of freedom.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that Donald Trump's leadership style shares striking similarities with those of post-colonial African dictators supported by the U.S. during the Cold War. The article points to actions like renaming landmarks, using troops against domestic protesters, and fostering a personality cult as parallels to figures like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. It suggests that these authoritarian tactics, once outsourced by the U.S. to proxy leaders, are now being mirrored domestically, representing a startling reversal in American political norms.</p>

          <p>Officials have detailed the "mass casualty event" in central Texas where at least 24 people died after the Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The unprecedented rainfall, which far exceeded forecasts, overwhelmed the river's forks, causing a sudden and catastrophic surge that left little time for warnings or evacuations. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration as hundreds of personnel continue search and rescue operations for the dozens still missing from a children's summer camp.</p>

          <p>The iconic Britpop band Oasis officially ended their 16-year hiatus with a powerful reunion concert in Cardiff, Wales, playing to an ecstatic crowd of over 60,000.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, making him the first foreign leader to receive it. The award was presented during Modi's two-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties, particularly in energy, health, and security. The visit underscores the deep historical connections between the two countries, rooted in the 19th-century migration of indentured Indian laborers to the islands.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' front office has indicated their trade deadline plans will not significantly change despite third baseman Max Muncy's recent knee injury. Although initially feared to be season-ending, the injury was diagnosed as a bone bruise with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. With Muncy projected to return well before the playoffs, the team plans to rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to fill the position in the interim, rather than making a reactive trade for a replacement.</p>

          <p>Several shark sightings in the waters off Far Rockaway, Queens, led to the temporary closure of a stretch of beach on the Fourth of July. Drones operated by city officials confirmed the sharks were swimming very close to beachgoers, prompting lifeguards to clear the water as a safety precaution. The incident highlights New York's increased use of drone technology to monitor shark activity and ensure public safety at its popular beaches during the busy summer season.</p>

          <p>As the United States takes measures against China's shipbuilding industry, competitors South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to increase their market share. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled its domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has outlined policies to support it through vessel development and improved production. The strategy focuses on promoting future-proof ships, such as autonomous and eco-friendly models, to reclaim a leading position in the global market. (not investment advice)</p>
