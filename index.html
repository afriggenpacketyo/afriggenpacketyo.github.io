          <p>Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor with Parkinson's disease, has found relief through deep brain stimulation (DBS), a treatment involving an implanted device that delivers electrical currents to the brain. After experiencing worsening tremors and involuntary movements, Laycock underwent DBS therapy, initially with traditional settings and later progressing to adaptive DBS (aDBS). The aDBS fine-tunes the stimulation in real time, reducing the risk of tremors during performances. Laycock's symptoms are now minimal, allowing him to continue his career and enjoy time with his family.</p>

          <p>As China and the United States resume formal trade talks, analysts predict a wide range of outcomes, from a deal that reduces tariff rates to a complete breakdown with no consensus. Ideal scenarios involve a pause in import duties, similar to previous suspensions, while worst-case scenarios include one or both parties walking out, causing market instability. Since Trump's return to the White House, tariffs on Chinese imports have significantly increased, prompting retaliatory measures from China, creating uncertainty for businesses and markets.</p>

By controlling critical supply chains and weaponizing trade through export controls, China aims to make other countries dependent on its exports. While this strategy has costs for China, including strained relations with trading partners, it reflects Xi's ambition to restore China's global influence and challenge the existing world order.</p>
