          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with China, stating that "we have the makings of a deal" ahead of an August 12 tariff deadline. While technical details are still being finalized, the sentiment suggests a potential de-escalation of the trade conflict that has seen both nations impose significant tariffs on each other's imports. The ongoing negotiations are characterized as "tough," but this development points toward a possible pact that could stabilize economic relations between the two global powers.

          <p>A major overnight Russian aerial assault on Kyiv has resulted in at least eight fatalities, including a six-year-old boy and his mother, and left over 120 people injured. Ukrainian officials reported that the attack involved more than 300 drones and multiple cruise missiles, which struck numerous locations across the capital, causing an apartment block to collapse. The attack represents a significant escalation, occurring despite a U.S. deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, highlighting the ongoing intensity and civilian toll of the conflict.</p>

          <p>An attempt to recall 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, an outcome that analysts believe has temporarily eased cross-strait tensions with mainland China. The recall campaign, framed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a move to "resist China, protect Taiwan," was closely watched by Beijing. A successful recall could have been interpreted as a rise in anti-China sentiment, potentially leading to a more confrontational stance from the mainland and creating new uncertainty in the region's delicate political balance.</p>

The children were hospitalized as a precautionary measure and have all since been discharged. The investigation is being led by a major incident team to determine the circumstances surrounding the event. Additionally, the police watchdog is independently investigating the force's handling of the initial concerns, specifically looking into potential delays in their response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is moving forward with a $7.9 billion rescission of foreign aid funding, but the lack of specific details on which programs will be cut has left aid organizations uncertain about the impact. The package targets broad categories like "global health" and "development assistance," with significant reductions expected for long-term development, infrastructure, and core funding for UNICEF. Critics argue these cuts will undermine efforts to build resilience in vulnerable communities and could ultimately be more costly by hindering preventative measures against humanitarian crises.

Growth areas included a record addition of 378,000 mobile customers and strong revenue from its film studios and theme parks, which helped offset a continued decline in pay-TV subscribers.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California, a decision that opens up the gubernatorial race and fuels speculation about her future political path. In her statement, Harris acknowledged that traditional politics have often failed and called for "new methods and fresh thinking," suggesting a potential shift in her approach. Allies believe she will now focus on broader national issues, such as helping Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections and engaging with key voter blocs, rather than holding a specific elected office for now.</p>

          <p>A man with double prosthetic legs held in an ICE detention center in Georgia was reportedly placed in solitary confinement after he refused to enter his cell due to flooding.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Emil Bove, a former Trump administration lawyer, to a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Court of Appeals, despite significant opposition and serious allegations from whistleblowers. Critics, including over 80 retired judges, raised concerns about Bove's alleged disregard for court orders and his personal loyalty to the former president, arguing his confirmation undermines judicial independence. The confirmation is seen by some as a sign that loyalty to Trump is a primary qualifier for advancement within the Republican party, raising alarms about the politicization of the judiciary.</p>
