          <p>Sources indicate that Japan's Nippon Steel is poised to acquire U.S. Steel at $55 per share, a deal that has navigated a complex political landscape. While President Trump initially cleared the bid, referring to it as a "partnership" with a $14 billion investment pledge over 14 months, President Biden had previously blocked it on national security grounds. Senator Dave McCormick stated that U.S. Steel will maintain an American CEO and a majority U.S. board, further solidifying the deal's structure, including a golden share requiring U.S. government approval for board members to ensure production levels are maintained, and Nippon seeks access to the U.S. market.

          <p>Donald Trump's restructuring of the U.S. National Security Council, including the dismissal of staff from the China team, has raised concerns about the predictability of Washington's approach to China. Diplomatic observers suggest that Trump may be increasingly relying on his instincts over expert advice, potentially leading to greater uncertainty in U.S.-China relations. The shake-up could also impact Taiwan, making it more challenging to communicate with key figures in the White House, and the administration's goal is to reduce the NSC's staff to 50.</p>
