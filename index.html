          <p>Haji Najibullah, a former Taliban commander, pleaded guilty to hostage-taking, including an American journalist, and providing material support for terrorism resulting in the deaths of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. The charges stem from incidents between 2007 and 2009, including attacks on a U.S. military convoy and the kidnapping of an American journalist and two Afghan nationals. Najibullah faces a life sentence after being arrested and extradited from Ukraine in 2020. The U.S. Attorney emphasized that those who harm Americans will be aggressively pursued, regardless of location or time.</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers are raising prices on numerous goods in response to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with average price hikes nearing 30%. Costs have increased on items ranging from tech accessories to clothing, as importers pass on the additional expenses to consumers. While Amazon claims the price increases affect only a small fraction of its products, other e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu have also raised prices.

Concerns are raised about the enforceability of obligations under a public benefit corporation structure, suggesting it would prioritize profit over the public good.
