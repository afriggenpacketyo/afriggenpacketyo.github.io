          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected as Ireland's 10th president following a landslide victory, securing an unprecedented 914,143 first preference votes (63%). The independent candidate, strongly backed by major left-wing parties, pledged in her acceptance speech to be an inclusive president for all citizens. She committed to being a voice for peace, upholding neutrality, addressing the existential threat of climate change, and recognizing extensive work across the country. Her triumph, officially declared at Dublin Castle, signifies a clear mandate from the people and a notable win for the combined opposition against the established parties.</p>

          <p>A year after devastating floods killed 229 people in Valencia, Spain, tens of thousands protested, demanding the resignation of regional leader Carlos Mazon. Demonstrators heavily criticized Mazon's administration for issuing an alert more than 12 hours after the national weather agency's highest warning for torrential rains. Residents reported receiving messages only after their homes and streets were already inundated. A judicial investigation into the emergency response is currently underway, with Mazon defending his actions by claiming a lack of necessary information and unforeseeable magnitude for Europe's worst flood-related disaster since 1967.</p>

She attributes her strong body confidence to her mother, Melanie Griffith, who taught her to care for and love her body, emphasizing its inherent beauty. Johnson explains that she wears dresses in which she feels beautiful and comfortable, acknowledging that not every bold style works for her. Her fashion-forward approach has occasionally led to amusing on-screen moments, yet she consistently embraces her fun and sexy personal style.</p>

          <p>Russian missile and drone attacks across Ukraine overnight killed at least four people and wounded 20, prompting urgent pleas from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for additional Western air defense systems. Kyiv reported two fatalities and 13 injuries from a ballistic missile strike, with debris damaging buildings and causing a fire. The Dnipropetrovsk region also suffered two deaths and seven injuries from the strikes. Zelenskyy specifically emphasized the critical need for more U.S. Patriot systems to adequately protect Ukrainian cities from this persistent "horror," reiterating his call for partners to implement discussed capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has embarked on his first Asia trip this term, aiming to finalize investment deals and advance peace efforts, culminating in a highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to de-escalate trade tensions. The extensive trip begins in Malaysia, followed by Japan and South Korea, where substantial investment commitments for U.S. factories are expected. This foreign travel occurs as the U.S. government shutdown continues, causing federal workers to miss their first full paychecks and drawing sharp criticism from Democratic leaders. During a refueling stop, Trump also met with the Emir of Qatar, thanking him for Middle East peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, a reclusive heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family and a major financial supporter of Donald Trump, has been identified as the anonymous donor who contributed $130 million to help pay U.S. military troops during the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump lauded him as a "great patriot" and "friend," though the donation amounts to only about $100 per service member, falling far short of the necessary $6.4 billion bi-weekly cost. Concerns have been raised that accepting these funds might violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending unappropriated funds, prompting criticism from Senator Chris Coons about anonymous donations funding government operations.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins suffered a significant and humbling 56-6 defeat against No. 2 Indiana, a performance described as a reversion to their early-season struggles. Quarterback Nico Iamaleva faced immediate pressure on the first offensive play, leading to a sack and an interception returned for a touchdown just 57 seconds into the game. The Bruins' offense sputtered, accumulating only 201 yards, while their defense was riddled with missed tackles and numerous penalties. This crushing loss marks a stark return to form for the 3-5 Bruins after a brief three-game winning streak, highlighting persistent challenges for the team.</p>

          <p>Compelling footage captured in Yellowstone National Park illustrates how a pack of wolves successfully collaborated to drive a grizzly bear away from a bison carcass. While a lone grizzly can typically displace one or two wolves, the coordinated efforts of the 8 Mile Pack proved too much for the bear. The wolves worked as a team, alternately nipping at the male grizzly's hide to keep him confused and unable to mount an offensive. This observation highlights the complex and dynamic predator interactions within the park, where pack numbers can significantly alter typical interspecies dominance over food resources.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's support among Hispanic adults has notably plummeted since the commencement of his second term, with only 25% now holding a "somewhat" or "very" favorable view, a sharp decline from 44% before his inauguration. This significant drop is mirrored by increasing unease about the nation's direction and reduced confidence in his economic and immigration policies. The shift is particularly impactful as nearly half of Hispanic voters backed him in 2024. The administration's continued hardline immigration enforcement is cited as a primary driver for this decreasing popularity, directly affecting Latino communities across various income levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral chart claiming the UK is Europe's "sexual assault capital" is misleading, despite using accurate numbers, due to significant differences in how countries define and report such crimes. Criminologists Tanya Serisier and Marcelo Aebi emphasize that varying legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors make direct cross-national comparisons problematic and inaccurate. The UK's 2003 overhaul to consent-based sexual offense laws and its method of counting multiple offenses by each perpetrator contribute to its seemingly higher reported rates. Experts recommend victim surveys, rather than police statistics, for a more accurate understanding of sexual assault prevalence, as police data only reflects reported cases.</p>

Thirty-nine men were arrested for violence during the demonstrations, which erupted from years of simmering anger over widespread unemployment and a lack of local control since Ladakh became a union territory in 2019. Locals feel deeply alienated and hurt by accusations of being "anti-national," despite their historical support for the Indian army, including during the 1999 Kargil conflict. Analysts warn that eroding trust in this strategically vital border region, bordering both China and Pakistan, could have serious national security implications for India.</p>

          <p>The "VOO and chill" strategy of passive investing through S&P 500 ETFs like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) is reportedly losing its appeal, even with stocks at all-time highs, due to growing diversification concerns. Investors are actively seeking broader market exposure beyond concentrated indexes, as technology now accounts for over 35% of the S&P 500, a record high, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight of 19%. This imbalance is driving renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and significantly outperforming the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur will address regional economic integration and stability, but a key underlying theme is the intensifying geopolitical rivalry between the US and China. Member states are increasingly pressured to choose sides, particularly in security, trade, and technology, despite their collective efforts to maintain a careful balancing act. Many ASEAN politicians are wary of Trump's tariff policies and perceive the US as an unreliable partner, especially given China's assertive actions in the South China Sea. Economically weaker states often align with China, while larger nations strive to maintain close cooperation with both superpowers.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU's firm commitment to ending its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are critical for modern technology and military applications. China's recent export curbs have severely impacted European industries, prompting the EU to urgently seek alternative sources and strengthen its "toolbox" for responding to such pressures. The comprehensive strategy involves recycling up to 95% of critical raw materials, boosting domestic production and post-processing capabilities, and establishing strategic partnerships with countries like Ukraine, Australia, Canada, and Greenland. This initiative is part of a broader push for greater European independence in key strategic sectors.</p>

He highlights that saving 40% on $2,000 worth of annual household consumables can yield $800 in tangible savings, which he considers a superior investment. Cuban strongly emphasizes paying with cash to avoid accumulating credit card debt, which he views as one of the biggest financial mistakes.

          <p>California's Proposition 50, proposing to redraw congressional district lines, is gaining strong support by framing itself as a direct counter to Donald Trump and Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states. Governor Gavin Newsom and Democrats are actively campaigning on a "fight fire with fire" message, aiming to create five additional safe Democratic seats to offset those gained by Republicans. Despite some mixed feelings about abandoning non-partisan maps, recent polls indicate the measure is passing by a significant margin, primarily driven by robust anti-Trump sentiment among high-propensity voters. The "yes" campaign has substantially outraised opponents, whose pleas, even from Arnold Schwarzenegger, have proven ineffective.</p>
