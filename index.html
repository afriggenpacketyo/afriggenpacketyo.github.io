          <p>A mass stabbing incident in the Hollow Water First Nation community in Manitoba has resulted in one death and at least six injuries. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reported that the suspect in the attack also died following the event. The incident, which prompted a heavy police presence and was described as a "mass casualty" event, is now under investigation by the RCMP's major crimes unit. Community leaders have expressed their condolences to those affected by what police characterized as a senseless act of violence in the small Anishinaabe community.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated two Ecuadorian gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the move, stating it provides more options for the U.S. to collaborate with Ecuador in combating these groups, including targeting their finances and sharing intelligence. This action comes amid escalating gang-related violence in Ecuador, which has intensified since the COVID-19 pandemic as transnational cartels expanded their operations. The designation reflects a more aggressive U.S. stance on narco-terrorism in the region.</p>

During a Senate hearing, Kennedy called Monarez's accusation a lie, escalating the public conflict over the administration's controversial changes to vaccine policy and federal health agency leadership, which he claims was done to remove conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has expressed that it is "very troubled" by the decision of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest from the American company Caterpillar. The fund's ethics council recommended the sale due to concerns that the company's equipment was being used in the widespread destruction of Palestinian property in the Gaza conflict. A U.S. State Department spokesperson called the claims illegitimate and confirmed engagement with the Norwegian government on the matter. Norway's finance minister emphasized that the decision was made independently by the central bank and was not political.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to house approximately 400 immigrant detainees at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola, a maximum-security prison with a history of brutal conditions. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated the move is intended to send a message to deter illegal immigration and crime, housing who she called "the worst of the worst." This is the latest in a series of actions by the administration to use prisons with fearsome reputations for immigration detention. Civil rights groups like the ACLU have raised serious constitutional concerns, arguing that civil immigration detention is not meant to be punitive.</p>

          <p>This article explores the financial implications of claiming Social Security benefits at different ages, from the earliest possible at 62 to the maximum-benefit age of 70. It outlines how monthly payments are permanently reduced for early claims and increased by about 8% annually for delayed claims past full retirement age. The article suggests that while immediate need is a primary factor, those with the financial flexibility to wait can significantly boost their guaranteed lifetime income. It also discusses strategies like using other retirement accounts or annuities to bridge the income gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement violates the Constitution. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb's lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction to halt the deployment, which was initiated as part of the president's nationwide crackdown on violent crime. The White House defended the action as within the president's legal authority to protect federal assets. This legal challenge follows a recent court ruling that blocked a similar deployment of the National Guard in California.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy has stepped down from his role as executive chairman of the Tottenham Hotspur football club after 24 years. His tenure, which began in March 2001, saw the club's transformation, including the construction of a new state-of-the-art stadium and a recent Europa League victory. However, his leadership also faced criticism from fans, particularly during last season's difficult Premier League campaign, with protests citing a lack of trophies and managerial turnover. Peter Charrington, a director of Tottenham's ownership group ENIC, will assume the new role of non-executive chairman.</p>

          <p>The states of Rhode Island and Connecticut have announced they will sue the Trump administration for its decision to halt construction of the Revolution Wind project. The offshore wind farm, which is 80% complete, was ordered to stop work by the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management, citing unspecified "concerns." The states' attorneys general argue the move is illegal and reckless, aimed at harming a key renewable energy project expected to power 350,000 homes. This lawsuit follows a separate legal challenge filed by the project's developer, Orsted, against the federal government.</p>

During a CNBC interview, Pulte stated it would be reckless to reveal his sources and methods, deflecting questions about potential political motivations behind the allegations. The accusations, which Cook denies, prompted President Trump to move to fire her from the Fed board.

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the deep-rooted influence of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved people, on American culture. The book argues that this hybrid tradition, with roots in West and Central African religions, has shaped everything from Southern cuisine and the blues to common superstitions. Stewart traces the legacy of the "conjure woman" through centuries of American history, highlighting the often-obscured contributions of Black women as healers, midwives, and cultural custodians. This exploration comes amid a resurgence of conjure's visibility in popular culture, such as in recent films and music.</p>

The city's mayor declared three days of mourning, while officials conduct safety checks on Lisbon's other funiculars.

          <p>Texas is set to enact a new law that empowers its residents to file civil lawsuits against out-of-state manufacturers or distributors of abortion medication. Under the legislation, successful plaintiffs—such as the pregnant woman's relatives—could be awarded at least $100,000 in damages. The law is designed to circumvent "shield laws" in other states that protect providers who mail abortion pills to states with bans. Opponents argue the measure will be used to intimidate providers and further restrict abortion access in a state that already has a near-total ban.</p>
