          <p>The Democratic National Committee deployed a taco truck in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., attempting to criticize President Trump's tariff policies. The acronym TACO, representing "Trump Always Chickens Out," was used to provoke Trump, a phrase previously coined by Wall Street analysts. Conservatives on social media widely mocked the stunt, citing it as an example of Democrats struggling with their messaging.  NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella also criticized the DNC for parking the truck at a church a block away from the RNC headquarters, highlighting the perceived ineffectiveness of the stunt.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering longstanding U.S. immigration policy.  The proposed rule would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe challenging to meet given current backlogs. Advocates express concerns that this could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and drive them to work illegally.  The Department of Homeland Security stated it is exploring options to protect national security and increase program integrity, noting past issues with the asylum system.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a 7% drop in extended trading after the security software maker issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast. While the company's earnings per share exceeded expectations, revenue aligned with forecasts, and costs rose in sales, marketing, research, and development.  For the current quarter, CrowdStrike projects adjusted earnings per share between 82 and 84 cents on revenue of $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion.  Despite this, CrowdStrike announced a $1 billion share buyback program, reflecting confidence in the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has formally requested Congress to take back $1.1 billion set aside for public broadcasters, including NPR and PBS.  Republicans accuse NPR and PBS of partisan bias, advocating for the elimination of federal funding funneled through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger warned that Trump's proposal would devastate public broadcasting stations, particularly in rural communities, while NPR CEO Katherine Maher questioned the legality of the request.</p>
