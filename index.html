Abel, 62, will inherit Buffett's value investing style and oversee Berkshire's substantial $347 billion cash reserve, and Buffett expressed confidence in Abel's managerial skills and hands-on approach, noting that Abel's management style is better suited for Berkshire's numerous subsidiaries.

          <p>Japan's estimated child population has decreased for the 44th consecutive year, reaching a new record low, according to government data released ahead of Children's Day. The number of children under 15 has fallen to 13.66 million as of April 1, a decrease of 350,000 from the previous year. This ongoing decline highlights the country's struggle to reverse its declining birth rate despite various government initiatives and social programs. The data underscores the urgent need for effective measures to address the demographic challenges facing Japan, which include an aging population and a shrinking workforce.</p>

          <p>China has refuted Japan's claim that a Chinese coast guard helicopter entered its airspace near the Senkaku Islands, asserting that a Japanese civilian aircraft was responsible for the incident. The Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned a Japanese embassy official to protest the alleged "intrusion of Japan's right-wing civilian aircraft" over the disputed islands. China urged Japan to halt illegal activities and prevent similar incidents, while Japan reiterated its protest over the helicopter's airspace violation. The incident occurred when a helicopter from a Chinese coast guard ship flew above the territorial waters around the uninhabited Senkaku islets, prompting a response from Japanese Air Self-Defense Force jets.</p>

          <p>Researchers and students at Yuelu Academy of Hunan University in China recreated a rice dish based on the 2,000-year-old "Shi Fang" manuscript, which contains ancient Chinese cooking practices. The students used wooden steamers and clay pots to prepare the rice, soaking it and steaming it in stages. Unlike modern rice, the ancient rice was described as "loose yet elastic" and had a lower sugar content. The project allowed students to connect with traditional Chinese culture and appreciate the culinary practices of the Han Dynasty.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials approved a $4 billion settlement to compensate nearly 7,000 victims of sexual assault in juvenile facilities and foster homes, with claims dating back to the 1950s. The settlement, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, addresses claims centered around facilities like the MacLaren childrenâ€™s center, where victims reported being drugged and abused. While the settlement aims to provide financial support and reforms to protect current foster children, some victims argue that closure will not come until those responsible for the abuse are held accountable. The county has proposed reforms including a hotline to report child sexual assault and expedited investigations.</p>

          <p>Native American women from southeastern Indigenous nations are reclaiming the tradition of inchunwa, or traditional tattoos, through efforts like the Inchunwa Project. The tattoos, which were once common but faded after colonization, are now being revived as a way to honor ancestors and set the groundwork for future generations. Receiving inchunwa is a deeply personal and community-supported process, with designs often inspired by pottery, shell carvings, and other artisan works.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to resist pressure from President Trump to cut interest rates, focusing instead on maintaining price stability. Despite Trump's calls for rate cuts and mounting fears of an economic slowdown, recent data showing a healthy jump in April payrolls supports the Fed's decision to hold rates steady. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge indicates that price pressures are easing, but higher U.S. duties on imports pose a risk to this progress. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies and global economic conditions remains a dominant factor influencing the Fed's decisions.</p>

The Conservatives suffered losses, and Labour was punished by voters dissatisfied with government spending curbs and higher taxes. This fragmentation of society and politics has created an opening for parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.

          <p>The Sudanese army reports that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a drone attack on a military airport in Port Sudan, marking the first time RSF attacks have reached the city. The attack targeted the Osman Digna Air Base, a goods warehouse, and civilian facilities, causing limited damage but no reported injuries. The conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF has resulted in at least 150,000 deaths and 12 million displaced civilians. Port Sudan, previously considered one of the safest places in the war-ravaged nation, serves as the de facto capital of Sudan's military-led government.</p>

          <p>The wildfires that swept through Los Angeles in January released hazardous materials into the air, water, and soil, and while homeowners hoped for a fresh start with government debris removal, soil testing was not part of the process.

This discovery raises concerns about the potential health risks for residents returning to these areas, and the effectiveness of the cleanup efforts.</p>

The service's strategy focuses on high-quality, talent-friendly projects, leading to comparisons with HBO. However, Apple TV+ is reportedly losing $1 billion a year, raising questions about its long-term sustainability. Apple views its streaming service as part of a broader subscription services business, with Apple TV+ contributing to the overall brand experience.
