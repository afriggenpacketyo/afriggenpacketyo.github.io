The excerpt details the recreation of historical settings and the use of cinematic techniques to convey Malcolm's complex character and his premonition of his own death. This book provides insight into how Malcolm X's message continues to resonate today.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, using the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" is highly detrimental to relationships. This phrase, often used during arguments, conveys a message that the partner is inadequate and someone else could do a better job. It can lead to insecurity and questioning of one's worth within the relationship. The psychologist suggests that this phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of openly communicating needs and frustrations. A better approach involves clearly and directly expressing one's needs without resorting to comparisons.</p>

          <p>The father of an 18-year-old fatally shot by Cincinnati police has allegedly killed a police officer with his car, less than 24 hours after viewing bodycam footage of his son's death. Ryan Hinton was shot after police said he pointed a gun at an officer, though the gun was later recovered unfired. The incident occurred shortly after the family viewed the footage, which shows the officer involved shouting, "He's got a gun!" The distraught father, Rodney Hinton, was charged with aggravated murder; the slain officer was not involved in Ryan Hinton's death.</p>

          <p>Southern Water is urging households to ration water use as the South East of England is experiencing drier conditions than regions like Sydney and Dallas. Managing Director Tim Mcmahon stated that reducing customer usage is necessary to avoid future bill increases and further infrastructure investments. He noted that current water sources are unsustainable, with 60% needing to change within 20 years. The company is investing in projects like a new reservoir in Hampshire and a potential reservoir near Abingdon to address the water shortage.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war is posing a threat to the Panama Canal, a critical passage for US East Coast-bound container traffic. Tariffs on Chinese goods have led to a significant pause in US imports from China, resulting in a surge of cancelled freight vessels. This decline in container traffic could impact the Panama Canal's revenue, which relies on vessel transits and container movement. The canal has also been a point of contention between the US and China, with Trump claiming Chinese control over key ports and threatening to reassert US control.</p>

          <p>Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers contends that President Trump's pressure campaign on universities, particularly Harvard, is an attempt to force them to comply with his agenda. Trump is leveraging research funds, foreign student status, and academic freedom to influence university policies on diversity and anti-Semitism. Summers acknowledges Harvard's issues with anti-Semitism and progressive bias but argues that Trump's tactics amount to "extortion" rather than genuine reform. He warns that this pressure could undermine academic freedom and slow progress in critical research areas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed uncertainty about whether people in the US are entitled to due process rights guaranteed by the Constitution, as his administration pursues aggressive deportation policies. He stated he doesn't know if citizens and non-citizens deserve due process, suggesting it would require millions of trials. Trump added that his lawyers would follow Supreme Court rulings. He also said pursuing a third presidential term "is not something I'm looking to do," despite previous hints to the contrary.</p>

Aid groups warn of a total collapse of humanitarian support, accusing Israel of using aid as a “political tool.” The situation is compounded by renewed bombing and evacuation orders, making it difficult to access remaining supplies.</p>
