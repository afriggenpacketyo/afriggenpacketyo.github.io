At least four individuals were injured in the assault before the alleged perpetrator was shot by armed police officers at the scene.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert analysis explores a recurring historical pattern where a "wealth pump" transfers wealth from the general population to a small elite, leading to societal instability. This dynamic creates popular discontent and an overproduction of elites competing for limited power, a combination that has historically preceded revolutions and civil wars. The article suggests that resolving such crises requires dismantling this mechanism through reforms, citing historical examples like the New Deal, and notes that while violent resolutions are common, peaceful exits are possible through deliberate policy changes.</p>

          <p>As the US federal government shutdown entered its second day, the Trump administration signaled that mass layoffs of federal workers were imminent. President Trump called for using the shutdown to eliminate "dead wood, waste, and fraud," while the Office of Management and Budget warned lawmakers that firings could begin within days. The administration also moved to cancel billions in energy and infrastructure funding for states with Democratic senators, escalating the political pressure amid the ongoing stalemate with Congress.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces intercepted a flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid in international waters, about 70 nautical miles off the coast of Gaza. Dozens of activists, including climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, were detained and transferred to an Israeli port for deportation.

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the largest water company in the United Kingdom. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances. The investors state the plan would rebuild the company without requiring taxpayer funds, but it hinges on adjusting performance targets that consumer advocates argue should not be relaxed.</p>

          <p>Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev described the tokenization of real-world assets as an unstoppable "freight train" that will eventually encompass the entire financial system. Speaking at a conference, he predicted that most major markets will establish a regulatory framework for tokenized assets like stocks and real estate within the next five years. Tenev believes this will become the standard method for gaining exposure to U.S. stocks internationally, merging the worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, has publicly warned the government against imposing additional taxes on retailers in the forthcoming budget. Ken Murphy stated that the industry has already absorbed substantial new operating costs this year, including higher national insurance and minimum wage rates, and declared that "enough is enough." His comments came as the retail giant upgraded its own profit forecast for the year, drawing criticism from unions who accuse the company of profiteering during a cost of living crisis.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis reveals that Ukraine has significantly escalated its drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in recent months, hitting 21 of the country's 38 large facilities since January. This campaign has reportedly caused fuel shortages and price increases in some regions of Russia, with verified videos showing long lines at gas stations. The strikes, some deep within Russian territory, appear to be a key part of Ukraine's strategy to damage Russia's economy and war-fighting capabilities.</p>

          <p>Following recent incursions by suspected Russian drones into NATO airspace, Germany is acknowledging significant shortcomings in its drone defense capabilities and is taking steps to address them. The country plans to procure advanced anti-aircraft systems, develop a multi-layered defense strategy, and purchase its first combat drones, including so-called kamikaze drones. These efforts, which include learning from Ukraine's wartime innovations, mark a major shift in Germany's defense posture after years of political hesitation regarding armed unmanned aircraft.</p>

          <p>Nationwide anti-government protests in Morocco have escalated, resulting in the first two fatalities after police reportedly opened fire on demonstrators in the southern town of Leqliaa.

Despite calls for peace from organizers, demonstrations in several cities have turned violent, with reports of arson, looting, and mass arrests by authorities.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has issued a formal response after a BBC undercover investigation exposed shocking instances of misogyny and racism within the force. In a letter to the home secretary, Rowley condemned the "appalling, potentially criminal, behaviour" and promised that officers with incontrovertible evidence against them would face fast-track dismissal hearings. He acknowledged deep-rooted cultural failings and outlined immediate actions, including dismantling the custody team at the center of the allegations and continuing what he termed the "biggest corruption clear-out in British policing history."</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has issued a formal apology for the fraud and human rights abuses that occurred within the country's historical foreign adoption programs. The apology follows a truth commission's report which found the government responsible for allowing poorly managed programs, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s, as a means to reduce welfare costs. Investigations revealed that many adoptees' records were falsified to portray them as orphans, when in fact some were removed or stolen from their birth families.</p>
