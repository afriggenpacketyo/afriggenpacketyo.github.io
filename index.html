          <p>Coinbase revealed that cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data for social engineering attacks, potentially costing the company up to $400 million. The hackers obtained sensitive data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, masked bank account numbers, and government ID images, but passwords and private keys were not compromised. Coinbase detected the breach independently, terminated the involved employees, warned affected customers, and enhanced fraud monitoring protections. The company is cooperating with law enforcement and offering a $20 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals, refusing to pay the ransom.

She made the comment while questioning the Solicitor General's argument that individual federal district court judges should not have the power to impose national injunctions blocking such executive actions. Justice Elena Kagan pressed the Solicitor General on how the Supreme Court could rule on the order's legality if district court judges couldn't issue injunctions. Trump has issued executive orders on a range of issues that have been halted by federal district court judges.</p>

CEO Doug McMillon stated that the higher tariffs will result in higher prices, despite the company's efforts to control costs and hold retail prices where possible. The price hikes are expected to go into effect later this month, joining other large retailers warning of likely price increases due to tariffs.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after it grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding forecasts. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, marking the period before US import tariffs and UK employer taxes increased in April. While the Labour government has prioritized boosting the economy, its decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has faced criticism from businesses. Analysts warn that the strong growth rate is unlikely to continue, with potential impacts from US tariffs and tax rises.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers at 75 U.S. stores are striking to protest a new dress code that requires employees to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black, or blue denim bottoms under their green apron. The union representing the workers, Starbucks Workers United, argues that the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining. Workers criticize the company for selling styles of Starbucks-branded clothing that employees are no longer allowed to wear, despite Starbucks providing two free black T-shirts to each employee. Starbucks claims the strike has a limited impact, with over 99% of its stores remaining open.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that a recession is still a serious possibility for the United States, despite the recent rollback of tariffs on China. Dimon deferred to his bank's economists, who place recession odds at close to a toss-up, noting that the situation remains uncertain. He acknowledged that while the tariff pauses are positive for the economy and market, import taxes are still sharply higher than last year and could cause economic damage. Dimon's comments mark a shift from his previous assessment that a recession was likely before the China truce.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed Ukraine's readiness to make decisions leading to peace but expressed uncertainty about the Russian delegation's mandate.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the legality of nationwide injunctions blocking President Trumpâ€™s executive order to restrict birthright citizenship. The justices will consider whether a single federal judge can issue an order freezing a policy for the entire country, rather than addressing the broader question of the policy's constitutionality. This case could set new limits on the power of federal judges to issue nationwide rulings, impacting the Trump administration's agenda beyond the birthright citizenship debate. Judges have issued 17 nationwide injunctions against the Trump administration, blocking policies related to Temporary Protected Status, federal funding to states, and funding for public schools with diversity initiatives.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent fanfare over the United States and Britain agreeing to lower some tariffs and create a $5 billion export opportunity for American agricultural products, concerns remain among British consumers regarding American food production standards. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture visited Britain to promote the agreement and counter the narrative that American meat is substandard. Key differences in food production, such as the use of growth hormones and chlorine-washed chicken, could hinder a more comprehensive trade agreement and limit the increase of American exports to Britain. British regulations emphasize animal welfare and environmental protections, creating resistance to changing these standards post-Brexit.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth, particularly in e-commerce, but cautioned that President Trumpâ€™s tariffs will soon lead to price increases for consumers. CEO Doug McMillon stated that despite efforts to keep prices low, the magnitude of the tariffs will make it difficult to absorb all cost pressures. The company refrained from projecting profits for the current quarter due to tariff policy uncertainties. Despite strong sales and unchanged full-year projections, shares of Walmart fell, reflecting investor concerns about the impact of trade wars on the retail sector.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from about half before the pandemic. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach, with the median sale price in the first quarter of 2025 nearing $420,000. The affordability gap is worst in cities with zoning restrictions that hinder new construction, such as Los Angeles and Scranton, Pennsylvania.</p>
