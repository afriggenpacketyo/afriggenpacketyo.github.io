          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a public dispute over social media, stemming from disagreements over Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." The conflict unfolded on X and Truth Social, with both figures exchanging criticisms. This public fallout has significant implications given Musk's previous close ties to the Trump administration. The feud highlights the volatile nature of relationships in Washington and the power of social media in shaping political narratives. The disagreement reportedly started after Musk criticized the Republicans‚Äô budget-reconciliation package (a.k.a. the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) and called the bill a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination.‚Äù</p>

          <p>A security guard at Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital near Chicago was shot during a struggle with a man in the emergency room. The incident began when the C.A.R.E. team approached the man, who appeared to be suffering from a mental health issue, near a Taco Bell and transported him to the hospital for evaluation. While in the ER, the man became agitated, leading to a confrontation with hospital staff and security. During the ensuing struggle, the man lunged for his belongings, revealing a weapon, and shots were fired, wounding the security guard; the man was taken into custody, and a handgun was recovered at the scene.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. This order follows a lawsuit by Harvard accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at stifling free speech. Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security and has criticized Harvard for not adequately addressing antisemitism on campus. The university had also amended its lawsuit, claiming the ban was retaliation for exercising its First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has been marked by dramatic shifts, from initial criticism to a close alliance and subsequent public fallout. Musk initially criticized Trump in 2016 but later joined his administration, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

          <p>The trend of consuming food products with fewer ingredients is growing, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). While some consumers seek simpler ingredient lists, nutritionists caution against sacrificing essential nutrients. Experts emphasize that not all UPFs are unhealthy, and processing can ensure food safety and extend shelf life. Food brands are responding to consumer demand by creating less processed products and utilizing new processing technologies.</p>

          <p>Young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. In many states, the time kids spend in detention doesn't count toward their ultimate incarceration, adding months to their confinement.

          <p>The search for Jomarie Calasanz, a Los Angeles woman who was swept away by the Kaweah River in Sequoia National Park while trying to save her sister, has been scaled down due to unsafe river conditions. Calasanz, a trained swimmer, entered the river to rescue her sister, Joanne, who was struggling in the currents. The multi-agency search lasted nine days but was hampered by snowpack melt and elevated river flow. Park officials are urging visitors to stay out of rivers during these conditions.</p>
