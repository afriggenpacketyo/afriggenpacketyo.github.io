          <p>Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken was reportedly asked to leave Georgica Beach in East Hampton, New York, due to closures enforced by Hurricane Erin's dangerous conditions. Photos showed Blinken and a friend packing up after a lifeguard and patrol vehicle approached them. East Hampton beaches had been closed for several days, with authorities citing strong rip currents, storm surge, and debris. This incident adds to previous scrutiny over Blinken's leisure activities during significant global events, such as his Hamptons vacation before the Taliban's takeover of Kabul.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is moving north-northeast. The National Hurricane Center reports maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 60 miles from its center. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen slightly before weakening by Tuesday, remaining over open waters and posing no immediate threat to land. This follows Hurricane Erin, which also formed in a similar area and reached Category 5 strength, causing hazardous conditions along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Wildfires are expanding across California's Napa County and central Oregon, leading to hundreds of evacuations amidst dry, hot weather. The Pickett Fire in Napa grew to over 10 square miles with 11% containment, threatening 500 structures and prompting air quality alerts. In Oregon, the Flat Fire reached nearly 34 square miles with no containment, endangering almost 4,000 homes and affecting 10,000 people. Firefighters are battling challenging conditions, including rugged terrain and high temperatures, with warnings issued for illegal drone use in affected areas. Climate change is noted as a factor contributing to more intense heatwaves and destructive wildfires.</p>

          <p>France has summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner after he published an open letter to President Emmanuel Macron, alleging France's failure to adequately address antisemitic violence. Kushner's letter, published in the Wall Street Journal, also criticized Macron's stance on recognizing a Palestinian state, claiming it fuels antisemitic incidents. The French foreign ministry deemed Kushner's allegations "unacceptable," noting the deep divides between France, the US, and Israel on Middle East policy. This diplomatic spat follows similar criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding Macron's advocacy for a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Baltimore, escalating a dispute with Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a Democrat, over the city's crime rates. Trump stated he would "quickly clean up the Crime" if Moore needed assistance, similar to actions in Washington D.C. Democrats have fiercely criticized the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement, calling it an "abuse of power." Despite official figures showing a significant decrease in violent crime in D.C., Trump continues to push for military intervention in Democratic-led cities, generating strong opposition from state leaders.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with Christine Bordine assuming the acting role. The ousting comes after the DIA's preliminary assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which indicated a setback of months, contradicting President Trump's public claim of "decades." Senator Mark Warner expressed concern over the Trump administration's "dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test." DIA employees were reportedly surprised and worried about their work being politicized, with two other military officials also removed from their posts.</p>

          <p>A proposed California bill to lower the cannabis excise tax from 19% back to 15% for six years is creating a standoff between the legal weed industry and child-care advocates. The tax cut would reduce state revenue by $180 million annually, including $81 million for subsidized child-care slots for low-income families. Child-care advocates argue this prioritizes cannabis over children, while the struggling legal cannabis industry claims the tax hike is unsustainable due to declining sales and illicit market competition.

However, he could not guarantee his future beyond the transfer window, citing ongoing discussions about transfers with Marinakis and global head of football Edu. Nuno's unhappiness stems from the club's summer transfer activity, as he seeks a new goalkeeper and two full-backs despite significant new attacking signings. While fans support Nuno, experts suggest he is unlikely to win a dispute with the owner, leading to uncertainty about his tenure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's repeated appearances with FIFA president Gianni Infantino, including an Oval Office meeting, signal his inescapable presence at the 2026 World Cup. Trump announced the World Cup draw will be held at Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center, a venue he now controls. Critics express concern over Trump's use of the event for political messaging, such as promoting his crime crackdown while the World Cup trophy was displayed. Infantino's deferential stance, including allowing Trump to touch the trophy and gifting him a final ticket, suggests FIFA is keen to maintain favor with the US president.</p>

          <p>Millions across the Western United States are under heat watches and warnings as a dangerous heatwave continues, pushing temperatures above 100 degrees through Tuesday. The National Weather Service warns of little nighttime relief, with overnight lows remaining well above normal, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses. This extreme heat exacerbates dry conditions, elevating fire risks and allowing existing wildfires, like the Pickett Fire in Napa County and the Flat Fire in central Oregon, to spread rapidly. Officials urge residents to stay hydrated, seek air-conditioned spaces, and check on vulnerable individuals.</p>
