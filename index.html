            <p>A Florida State University student, McKenzie Heeter, described the harrowing experience of witnessing the beginning of a campus shooting where she was just feet away from the gunman. Sheeter recounted seeing the suspect waving a rifle and then shooting a woman, prompting her to flee in panic. Two people were killed, and six others were injured in the shooting, which has left the campus community feeling unsafe.

            <p>Marvin Roberts, an Alaska Native man, has settled with the city of Fairbanks for $11.5 million after spending nearly two decades in prison for a murder he maintained he did not commit. Roberts was one of the "Fairbanks Four," a group of Indigenous men whose convictions were vacated in 2015 amid allegations of racial bias in the investigation. The settlement is considered a vindication of Roberts' innocence and will provide him with financial freedom and more time with his family.

            <p>An opinion piece argues against the notion that small modular reactors (SMRs) are a solution for California's energy needs, citing high costs and historical failures. The author, who has experience with the Department of Energy, claims that SMRs are even less economically viable than large nuclear plants, especially with tariffs in place. The author points to the Vogtle plant in Georgia as an example of the high costs associated with nuclear power.

The attack has drawn condemnation from the Houthis and Iran, who view it as a violation of Yemen's sovereignty. The U.S. also accused a Chinese satellite company of supporting Houthi attacks, further internationalizing the conflict.</p>

Many immigrants are weighing the decision to leave on their own terms, returning to their home countries with some savings rather than risk being forcibly removed.

            <p>Elizabeth Lam, a transitional-kindergarten teacher at Palisades Charter Elementary School, lost her collection of over 30 Minnie Mouse ears in the Palisades fire, which destroyed most of the school. Lam used the ears to connect with her students during the COVID-19 pandemic, earning her the nickname "Disney teacher." During the evacuation, Lam prioritized the safety of her students over saving her collection. Disney fan Rosie Keiser organized a crowdfunding effort to replace Lam's ears, bringing joy to the teacher amidst the devastation.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has fallen in the global rankings of the world's busiest airports due to a drop in domestic travel and slow recovery from the pandemic. LAX, once the third-busiest airport in the world, is now ranked 15th. The decline is attributed to factors such as consumer confidence, immigration policies, and trade policies. Despite a $30-billion overhaul, LAX is revising its fiscal budgets due to the recent drop in domestic travelers.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece argues that Harvard's resistance to the Trump administration's demands sends a crucial signal that opposition is possible. Universities should collaborate on a shared litigation strategy, engage the public, and encourage Congress to push back against Trump's actions. The author contends that Trump is using a moral panic about "woke" and pro-Palestinian protests to subjugate universities, which pose a threat to autocrats. They criticize the idea of ideological audits and totalitarian social engineering in the name of "viewpoint diversity."</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is accused of punishing immigrants for following the rules, creating a climate of fear and distrust. Cases like the arrest of a Palestinian student during a naturalization interview and the sharing of undocumented taxpayers' data with immigration agencies are cited as examples. These actions undermine trust in the government and push immigrants further into the shadows, making them less likely to report crimes or seek help. The administration is also targeting immigrants with legal status, revoking visas and green cards for expressing views that the secretary of state does not like.</p>
