          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland. The judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the protests were not disruptive enough to justify federalizing troops without the state governor's consent. This decision emphasized the constitutional line between civil and military power, stating the president's justification was "untethered to the facts" and infringed on Oregon's sovereignty, a ruling celebrated by state officials.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering the creation of a one-dollar coin featuring President Donald Trump to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary. A draft design depicts Trump on one side and an image from after his 2024 assassination attempt on the other, inscribed with "Fight, Fight, Fight." The proposal relies on a 2020 law allowing for semiquincentennial coin designs, though it faces potential legal hurdles, including a long-standing prohibition against featuring living individuals on U.S. currency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized 300 National Guard troops to be sent to Chicago to protect federal assets amid ongoing protests, a move criticized by state leaders as an abuse of power. The decision was announced shortly after a federal judge blocked a similar deployment in Portland, Oregon, citing a lack of factual basis for military intervention. The White House stated the deployment is a response to "violent riots and lawlessness," while critics argue it dangerously blurs the line between military and civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Despite political turmoil like the U.S. government shutdown, global equity markets are showing strong risk-on sentiment, with major indexes hitting record highs and significant fund flows into sectors like technology. However, a counter-narrative is emerging, with an increasing number of analysts warning about the formation of market bubbles, particularly in credit markets. Experts advise investors to diversify and prepare for potential instability, drawing parallels between the expansive private credit market and the pre-2008 subprime crisis.

          <p>After decades in operation, pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced it is closing all of its locations nationwide. The company, which was founded in 1962, had filed for bankruptcy for the second time in two years this past May. Following its 2023 bankruptcy filing, the company had already closed over 520 stores to restructure its debt and address litigation claims related to the opioid crisis. The company's website now directs former customers to services for transferring their pharmacy records.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza within days after Hamas agreed to key parts of a U.S.-brokered peace plan. The proposal involves Hamas releasing hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with Israel preparing to implement the first phase, which includes a redeployment of its forces but not a full withdrawal. U.S. officials view Hamas's response positively, and negotiations involving American, Israeli, and Egyptian delegations are expected to finalize the technical details of the agreement shortly.</p>

Despite the difficult diagnosis, she is using this knowledge proactively to plan for a family, intending to use IVF and embryo screening to ensure her children do not inherit the gene.</p>

The surge is largely attributed to intravenous drug use among young people, with practices like "bluetoothing"—injecting another person's blood to share a high—becoming more common.

The elections have been postponed in three provinces due to security concerns and standoffs with Kurdish-led forces.

The effect is amplified by lifestyle factors common in the first few weeks of university, such as stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption, all of which can suppress the immune system's ability to fight off infections.</p>

          <p>An explosion and large fire at Chevron's El Segundo refinery have raised concerns among local communities and environmental advocates, adding to the facility's long record of violations. The incident is being investigated by local air quality regulators, but federal oversight is limited due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has furloughed staff at agencies like OSHA and the Chemical Safety Board. Public records show the refinery has received numerous citations for safety and environmental failures, including 13 notices of violation from the local air district in the last year alone.</p>

          <p>An FBI agent has allegedly been suspended for insubordination after refusing to take part in a planned "perp walk" for former FBI Director James Comey. According to media reports, FBI leadership had discussed using heavily equipped agents to publicly escort Comey to his arraignment on charges of lying to Congress. The suspended agent reportedly found the plan inappropriate for a non-violent case. The charges against Comey were filed shortly after President Trump publicly called for more aggressive investigations into his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is forcing National Parks across the country to close or operate with severely limited staff and services, creating confusion for visitors. While the National Park Service aims to keep sites as accessible as possible, services like trash collection, restroom maintenance, and emergency response are minimal or nonexistent in many locations. Some states are using their own funds to keep parks open, but advocates worry about the risk of vandalism and environmental damage, citing harm done to parks during the last major shutdown in 2018-2019.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly attack outside a synagogue, Greater Manchester Police have deployed hundreds of extra officers to provide a visible presence and reassure the public. The force has cancelled rest days and brought in officers from other regions to bolster patrols, particularly in Jewish communities and the city center. The increased security measures are also in place for the Conservative Party Conference, which is scheduled to begin in the city. Authorities have questioned the appropriateness of a pro-Palestine march held on Saturday, urging respect for the victims.</p>

          <p>A terror attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur left two worshippers, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, dead and three others seriously injured. The attacker, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, rammed his car into people before attempting to storm the synagogue with a knife and was shot dead by police. One of the deceased victims was tragically killed by police gunfire aimed at the attacker. Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, was on bail for a sexual assault allegation and is believed to have been influenced by extremist ideology.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police arrested nearly 500 people in central London during a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the UK government as a terrorist organization. Most arrests were for the offense of supporting a banned group. The protest went ahead despite calls from police and politicians to postpone it following the recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers argued that canceling the vigil would be "letting terror win" and that it is possible to grieve for multiple tragedies simultaneously.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's recent back-to-back Premier League losses, both sealed by stoppage-time goals, have highlighted underlying issues for the reigning champions. After starting the season with several dramatic late victories that masked inconsistent performances, the team has now suffered three consecutive defeats across all competitions. Analysts point to an imbalance following nearly £450m in new signings and struggles for form from key players like Mohamed Salah. The international break may offer a welcome chance for the team to regroup and address the flaws exposed in their recent matches.</p>
