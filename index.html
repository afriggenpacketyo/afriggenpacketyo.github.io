          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant drop, closing down over 800 points, as bond yields surged due to growing concerns about the national debt and a proposed tax cut bill. The sell-off on Wall Street was triggered by the 10-year Treasury yield reaching its highest level since February, exacerbating investor anxieties about the broader economic impact. The Congressional Budget Office's report highlighting the potential addition of $3.8 trillion to the national debt due to Trump's tax policies further fueled market unease.

          <p>For retirees seeking financial flexibility, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a relatively inexpensive option, particularly with average home equity amounts exceeding $300,000. HELOC interest rates have seen a steady decline since early 2024, offering retirees a variable rate structure that can benefit them in a cooling rate environment. HELOCs can serve as useful emergency funds, requiring borrowers to pay only the interest on the amount borrowed during the draw period, making them more attractive than credit cards, personal loans, and home equity loans.
