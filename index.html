        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening, citing a recent Labor Department report that significantly revised job growth downwards. The report reduced nonfarm payrolls by 911,000 for the year through March 2025, the largest revision in over two decades. While Dimon acknowledged robust corporate profits, he noted a weakening consumer and expressed uncertainty about whether the slowdown would lead to a recession. He suggested the Federal Reserve will likely reduce its benchmark interest rate soon, though he questioned the potential impact of such a move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman has died while attempting to cross the English Channel in an overloaded migrant dinghy that experienced a "catastrophic deflation" approximately 10 miles off the coast of Dover. A large-scale rescue operation involving the UK Coastguard, Border Force, and lifeboats was launched, but the woman was pronounced dead after being airlifted to shore. The incident highlights the ongoing dangers of small boat crossings, with UK officials expressing shock and sadness over the tragedy. This event occurred as figures show over 30,000 people have made the crossing to the UK in 2025.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces conducted what they described as a "precise strike" in Doha, Qatar, targeting the residential headquarters of senior Hamas leaders. The Israel Defense Forces stated the operation was aimed at individuals responsible for the October 7th massacre and the ongoing war. The strike drew immediate and strong condemnation from Qatar, which called it a "cowardly Israeli attack" and a violation of its sovereignty. Numerous world leaders and nations, including the U.N., Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, also condemned the action, warning it could destabilize the region and undermine ceasefire negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four years after the tragic collapse of the Champlain Towers South condominium in Surfside, Florida, federal investigators have announced preliminary findings suggesting the collapse likely began in the pool deck. Researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that the deck's slab-column connections had "critically low margins of safety" due to design flaws and misplaced reinforcement dating back to the building's construction. This initial failure on the pool deck is believed to have triggered a progressive collapse that spread to the main tower, ultimately leading to the deaths of 98 people in June 2021.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers came agonizingly close to pitching a no-hitter on two separate occasions within a three-day span, only to lose both bids in the final inning. On Monday, a combined effort led by starter Tyler Glasnow was broken up by the first batter in the ninth, though the Dodgers held on to win against the Colorado Rockies.

          <p>Bulgaria has become a crucial, yet initially secretive, supplier of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, leveraging its long-standing expertise in producing Soviet-era armaments. Initially, these supplies were routed covertly through third countries like Poland to avoid Russian interference. Now, Bulgaria is openly participating in EU-led efforts, with German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall investing €1 billion to establish a new plant for producing NATO-standard 155-mm artillery shells. This shift positions Bulgaria as a significant contributor to Ukraine's defense and signals a strategic integration of its defense industry with Western European partners to support the ongoing war effort.</p>

          <p>Recently released data from the National Center for Education Statistics, known as The Nation's Report Card, indicates a troubling decline in academic performance for U.S. students. The 2024 assessments show that average scores for eighth graders in science and for 12th graders in both mathematics and reading have dropped since 2019. The results, described as "sobering" by officials, also reveal the widest performance gaps ever recorded between the highest- and lowest-performing students. This downward trend, which reportedly began before the COVID-19 pandemic, raises significant concerns about the state of education and student achievement across the country.</p>

          <p>In his annual State of the State address, delivered in writing, California Governor Gavin Newsom portrayed his state as being "under siege" by a hostile Trump administration. Newsom accused the federal government of undermining public services, disregarding the rule of law, and using bullying tactics against businesses and universities. He framed California as a resilient bulwark defending democratic values against what he termed "poisonous populism" and an administration built on "incompetence and malicious ignorance." The address highlights the deepening political rift between California and the federal government, with Newsom positioning the state as a leader in progressive and environmental policies.</p>

          <p>In an advice column for The Atlantic, a 26-year-old reader expresses concern over her inability to feel a "spark" despite seven years of being single and three years of intentional dating. She describes meeting nice men with whom she aligns on priorities but feels no growing excitement or connection after a few dates, leading her to question if her expectations are unrealistic. The columnist, James Parker, suggests she may be overthinking the process with too much "front-brain activity" and executive planning, which can stifle spontaneous romantic feelings. He advises her to be more open to the unpredictable and less regulated in her approach to love and relationships.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market was substantially weaker over the past year than initial reports suggested, according to a preliminary annual revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data for the year ending in March 2025 was revised down by 911,000 jobs, the largest such revision on record, indicating that job growth was overestimated by an average of 76,000 per month. This adjustment provides new evidence that the economy was already on a softer footing before recent signs of a slowdown. The largest downward revisions occurred in the leisure and hospitality, professional services, and retail sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Eligibility for Medicare is primarily based on age (65 or older) or disability, not wealth. However, higher earners are subject to an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA), which increases the monthly premiums for Medicare Part B (medical insurance) and Part D (prescription drugs). The article explains that these surcharges are calculated based on tax returns from two years prior, and it offers strategies for retirees to manage these costs, such as strategic withdrawals from retirement accounts.</p>

          <p>A new European Union report has warned that the post-war, rules-based global order is effectively dying, making a return to the previous status quo "increasingly unlikely." The report highlights growing geopolitical turmoil and calls for the EU to achieve greater autonomy, reducing its dependence on the United States for digital services and on China for critical minerals. It notes that everything from supply chains to humanitarian aid can now be "weaponised," posing serious economic and security risks. The document serves as a stark assessment of the current global landscape ahead of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's annual address.</p>

          <p>In an interview promoting her new children's book, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor asserted that the ultimate power to create lasting change in the United States rests with its citizens, not the judiciary. She explained that while she can decide individual cases and express her legal opinions, it is the public that either supports or changes the status quo through their actions. Sotomayor declined to comment on the specifics of a pending immigration profiling case but encouraged people to read full court opinions to understand different legal perspectives. She also briefly explained the court's controversial "shadow docket."</p>

          <p>On CNBC, Jim Cramer identified Home Depot as the stock with the "most upside" in his investment portfolio, citing optimism around anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. He referenced the recent significant downward revision of U.S. job creation figures as a key indicator that could prompt multiple rate cuts this year. Cramer advised investors to view the recent decline in lumber prices as a buying opportunity for the home improvement retailer's stock. He expressed confidence that both long-term and short-term rates will fall, benefiting companies like Home Depot. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has seized on a major downward revision in U.S. jobs data to attack the economic record of the previous Biden administration, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the revision—the largest on record—proof that "Biden's economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken." The statement reiterated calls for new leadership at the BLS to restore trust in its data. It also renewed criticism of Powell, labeling him "Too Late" and demanding he "must cut the rates now."</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a week of engagements with charities he supports, arriving on the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death. However, it is unclear if he will meet with his father, King Charles III, or his estranged brother, Prince William, during the visit. The Duke of Sussex has not seen his brother in person since 2022, and his last meeting with the King was a brief one in February 2024 following the monarch's cancer diagnosis. Royal experts suggest that if a meeting with his father doesn't happen this week, it would signal that their relationship remains deeply fractured.</p>

          <p>The European Union is coordinating with the United States to prepare its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, as Moscow intensifies its air attacks on Ukraine. EU officials traveled to Washington to discuss the new measures, which are expected to be announced soon and will likely target Russia's energy sector more aggressively. A key point of discussion is the potential for secondary sanctions against countries, such as China, that purchase Russian energy. The new package is also expected to list more vessels in Russia's "shadow fleet" and impose further restrictions on Russian diplomats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Michigan judge has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 individuals who signed certificates falsely claiming Donald Trump won the state's 2020 electoral votes. The judge cited a lack of sufficient evidence to prove fraudulent intent, a crucial element for the prosecution's case. The defendants were alleged to have covertly met in the Michigan Republican Party headquarters to sign the documents. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel criticized the ruling, stating the evidence of their intent to lie was clear, and her office is considering an appeal. The dismissal marks a significant setback for efforts to prosecute those involved in the "fake elector" schemes.</p>
