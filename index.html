          <p>Prosecutors in South Korea are seeking an arrest warrant for former first lady Kim Keon Hee on allegations of bribery, stock manipulation, and political influence peddling. This follows a seven-hour interrogation regarding claims she influenced political nominations and received illicit gifts. If the court approves the warrant, it would mark a historic moment where both a former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, and first lady are arrested, as Yoon is already detained on separate charges. The case is one of three special investigations launched under the new government.</p>

The meeting follows a series of talks by a U.S. envoy and comes as a U.S. deadline for a ceasefire approaches. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed support for a potential three-way summit, the Kremlin has not committed to that format. Trump remains cautious, emphasizing the goal is to end the conflict and stop the loss of life.</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reached a £46.3 million agreement to sign Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez. The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is set to undergo a medical before completing the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 and scored 40 goals in 143 appearances, but his starting opportunities became limited in the previous season. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial resources to pursue a deal for Newcastle's Alexander Isak.</p>

          <p>The UK has started detaining migrants as part of a new pilot scheme with France, which will see an equal number of asylum seekers exchanged between the two countries. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the first returns could happen within weeks, and the government will defend against legal challenges, asserting France is a safe country. The 11-month program aims to deter small boat crossings, which have increased significantly this year. The Conservative opposition criticizes the plan as less effective than their proposed Rwanda scheme.</p>

          <p>The NHL is facing criticism after Commissioner Gary Bettman and other league figures joined Donald Trump's sports council, which aims to exclude transgender women from women's sports. This move is seen as contradictory to the NHL's 2022 diversity and inclusion report, which emphasized engagement across all gender identities. Critics, including the first transgender professional hockey player, argue the partnership is a significant step backward for inclusivity in the sport. The article frames this as part of a pattern of the NHL retreating on social issues, such as its previous ban on Pride-themed jerseys.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is violating federal law by suing a deputy sheriff for sharing an individual's immigration status with federal agents. The author contends that a state law prohibiting such cooperation is unconstitutional under the supremacy clause and directly contradicts federal statute 8 U.S.C. § 1373. The piece criticizes the state's sanctuary policies, claiming they endanger public safety by allowing criminals to remain in communities. The author calls for the reinstatement of the disciplined officers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, a key research hospital for rare and life-threatening diseases, has seen a significant drop in patient numbers this year. Government documents show a decline in both inpatients and outpatients, which officials attribute to an exodus of clinicians and scientists following mass firings and research grant cancellations by the Trump administration. This reduction in staff and patient recruitment jeopardizes crucial clinical trials and care for vulnerable populations. Former officials warn that the damage to this complex medical ecosystem could take a long time to repair.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll shows public approval of the U.S. Supreme Court has fallen below 40% for the first time, highlighting an unprecedented partisan gap. Republicans maintain high approval, while trust among Democrats has collapsed, a trend consistent across multiple polls since the court gained a 6-3 conservative supermajority. The article attributes this divide to recent politically charged rulings, such as granting Donald Trump broad immunity and blocking lower court decisions that limited his power. This reflects a long-term trend of both parties appointing carefully vetted, ideologically aligned justices, transforming the court into a perceived partisan institution.</p>

          <p>The NFL has officially banned the use of smelling salts by players on the field, citing safety concerns and the risk of masking concussion symptoms. The league's decision aligns with an FDA warning that the ammonia-based substances have not been proven safe or effective for boosting alertness. While some players expressed dismay at the ban, medical experts note that inappropriate use can cause adverse effects. A key concern is that the jolt from smelling salts could hide signs of a concussion, preventing proper medical evaluation and potentially worsening an injury.</p>

In a subsequent interview, Flood defended the new Medicaid work requirements, stating they apply only to able-bodied individuals who choose not to work.

          <p>Following severe floods in Texas, a federal aid hotline was largely unreachable for five days because the Department of Homeland Security allowed funding for call centers to lapse. Internal logs show FEMA answered only about 15,000 of 55,000 calls during this period, with wait times exceeding 90 minutes. The delay is attributed to an administrative bottleneck requiring the DHS Secretary to personally approve large funding requests.

The proposal, supported by the IPPR think tank, suggests raising taxes on online gambling to generate an estimated £3.2 billion annually.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Billionaire David Tepper is Shifting AI Investments from Nvidia to Broadcom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:06:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of recent 13F filings, billionaire investor David Tepper's fund, Appaloosa, has significantly reduced its holdings in AI hardware giants Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC over the past year. In contrast, the fund has been increasing its stake in Broadcom, another trillion-dollar company with a strong position in the AI sector. The article suggests this shift may be due to valuation concerns with Nvidia and a belief that Broadcom's diversified business in networking solutions and custom chips offers a more resilient investment. Broadcom's role in connecting AI-GPUs and its broader portfolio may make it less vulnerable if an AI bubble were to burst. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New sweeping U.S. tariffs on goods from more than 90 countries have officially been implemented by the Trump administration. The import taxes are part of the president's strategy to reshape global trade, which he argues is unfair to the U.S. Some of the highest levies are on Southeast Asian nations like Laos and Myanmar, while major economies such as the UK, Japan, and the EU have negotiated lower rates. The administration also hit India with a 50% tariff over its Russian oil purchases and threatened a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips to encourage domestic production.

          <h2>Opinion: To Tackle Global Crises, Leaders Must Embrace Uncertainty Instead of Control</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the tendency of political leaders to seek tight control is ill-suited for solving complex global issues like climate change and economic instability. The author suggests that this "power over" approach, built on domination and coercion, stifles the creative and collaborative thinking needed to address the current "polycrisis." Instead, leaders and institutions should embrace uncertainty and "let go," fostering co-creation and pluralist thinking. This shift away from a fear-based, controlling mindset is presented as essential for renewing democracy and navigating a world facing ecological collapse and rising fascism.</p>

          <p>Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has provided an optimistic outlook for the industry, signaling a recovery from a recent period of extreme turbulence. A bumper olive harvest in Spain has led to a 50% drop in raw material prices, allowing the company to lower shelf prices and stimulate consumer demand. This follows two years of poor yields, which, combined with inflation and extreme weather, caused prices to soar. The CEO of the Spain-based company expressed cautious optimism for a more balanced and promising market landscape ahead.</p>

          <p>Some financial experts are suggesting that China is making progress in managing its significant local government debt through a sweeping restructuring campaign. A debt-swap program has allowed local governments to extend repayment periods, bringing the situation under greater control. In contrast, these experts express growing concern over the debt challenges in the United States, where the burden sits at the federal level. According to a finance professor at Renmin University, China's ability to have the central government assist with local debt provides more stability than the U.S. situation.
