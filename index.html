          <p>Nvidia shares increased as the Trump administration is preparing to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would have restricted exports of advanced AI chips. The Department of Commerce confirmed the plan, stating that the rule was overly complex and would stifle American innovation. Chipmakers, including Nvidia and AMD, have opposed the rule, with Nvidia's CEO emphasizing the potential loss from being locked out of the Chinese AI market.</p>

          <p>Three college presidents apologized for not acting more aggressively to curb antisemitism on their campuses during a House committee hearing. Republicans threatened to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools, while Democrats accused Republicans of tolerating antisemitism in their own party. The hearing, titled “Beyond the Ivies,” focused on institutions outside the Ivy League that have drawn attention for their handling of antisemitism allegations. The hearing also looked back to events from a year ago, when campuses across the country were reeling from protest encampments and mass arrests.</p>
