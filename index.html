          <p>Shares of the online ticket marketplace StubHub fell 10% on Friday, marking the third consecutive day of losses since its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is now trading approximately 21% below its IPO price, reflecting a challenging market entry for the company. This performance contrasts with other recent tech IPOs that saw early gains for investors. StubHub's debut was delayed multiple times, and its CEO acknowledged that new federal regulations on transparent ticket pricing are expected to have a one-time negative impact on the company's financial results.</p>

          <p>Pattern Group, a prominent third-party seller on Amazon's marketplace, saw its stock rise 11% in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq. The company, which describes itself as an "ecommerce accelerator" for over 200 brands, raised $300 million through its initial public offering, valuing it at roughly $2.5 billion. The successful debut comes amid a revitalized market for tech IPOs, though the company noted significant risks in its prospectus. These include its heavy reliance on the Amazon platform and uncertainties surrounding international trade policies and potential tariffs from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to introduce a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program widely used by technology companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. This significant new cost would be in addition to existing fees, which can already total several thousand dollars per application. The move targets a program that critics argue allows companies to hire foreign labor at lower wages than American workers. President Trump is also expected to direct the Labor Secretary to begin a rule-making process to update the prevailing wage requirements for H-1B visa holders, further altering the landscape for skilled worker immigration.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr's recent comments regarding ABC and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's suggestion that the network could face repercussions for Kimmel's commentary to tactics used by the mafia, calling the rhetoric "dangerous as hell." While stating he was personally pleased Kimmel was taken off the air, Cruz warned that using government power to regulate speech sets a perilous precedent that could be used against conservatives in the future. The controversy stems from Carr's remarks made shortly before ABC indefinitely suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!".</p>

          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note reached a two-week high, climbing above 4.13% even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive market reaction suggests that investors are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and government debt issuance. Recent data showing fewer jobless claims has eased some concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Investors are now looking ahead to the upcoming release of the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, for further insights into the economic outlook.

This shift, influenced by new members appointed by the Kennedy administration, reflects a significant change in public health policy.

A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is among the cheapest, with average rates around 8.05% and the potential to become more affordable with future rate cuts. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate, while personal loans provide an unsecured option that is still significantly cheaper than high-interest credit cards. While borrowing costs remain higher than in recent years, the downward trend in interest rates presents opportunities for consumers seeking financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing increasingly expensive grocery bills, with food prices rising at their fastest monthly rate since 2022. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a shortage of farm workers in the U.S. Tariffs have led to significant price hikes on imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production to other regions. The combination of these pressures is forcing companies to pass on higher costs to consumers, leading many shoppers to seek discounts and alter their buying habits.</p>

This article argues that the very openness that allows for free expression and dissent also makes societies vulnerable to authoritarian figures who can exploit these freedoms to silence opponents. The author draws parallels from ancient Athens to Weimar Germany, suggesting that today's wide-open digital information environment can be weaponized to spread disinformation and erode shared reality.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's $15 billion lawsuit against Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publisher, represents a dangerous new phase in the assault on free speech. While the lawsuit was quickly dismissed by a judge, the author contends that its purpose was not to win in court but to intimidate and create a chilling effect across the publishing industry. The action is framed as part of a broader authoritarian playbook to control information and silence critics, following a pattern of targeting major institutions in media and education. The author warns that such legal threats against publishers endanger the freedom to write and hold power accountable.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at Tampa International Airport discovered a human skull and other bones inside a passenger's luggage during a routine inspection. The remains were found wrapped in foil after agriculture specialists initially flagged the traveler's bag for prohibited items. The passenger reportedly told officers that the bones were intended for ritualistic use. Citing potential health risks, CBP officials stated that the remains were seized and subsequently destroyed. The incident highlights the unusual and unpredictable nature of items that customs officers encounter while screening international travelers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court to block a lower court's order regarding gender markers on passports. The Justice Department is seeking to halt an injunction that prevents the State Department from enforcing a policy that limits passport gender identification to only male or female based on biological sex. The lower court's order allows transgender and non-binary individuals to select M, F, or X as their gender marker, a practice the administration argues it cannot be forced to adopt. This legal battle is one of several stemming from a presidential executive order aimed at recognizing only two sexes.</p>

          <p>A sheriff's deputy in Wyandotte County, Kansas, has been charged with second-degree murder following the death of a 50-year-old inmate in July. The inmate, Charles Adair, died from complications of "mechanical asphyxia" after an altercation with jail staff, during which an officer knelt on his back, according to an autopsy report. The report found that Adair sustained broken ribs and a fractured sternum. The charged deputy, Richard Fatherley, is on paid administrative leave and also faces an alternative count of involuntary manslaughter. Adair's family is calling for the release of camera footage of the incident.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Western countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and France, have announced plans to formally recognize Palestine as a state. This shift in policy, which has been criticized by Israeli officials, comes as the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly backed a resolution supporting a two-state solution. Currently, 147 countries recognize Palestinian statehood, but full UN membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council. The recent announcements signal a significant change in diplomatic posture among key Western allies, driven in part by frustration with the stalled peace process and Israel's ongoing military actions.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon, a former White House chief strategist, has suggested that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent should simultaneously lead the Federal Reserve on an interim basis. In a podcast interview, Bannon proposed that Bessent could hold both powerful positions through the midterm elections before transitioning to lead the Fed full-time. The White House has stated that such an arrangement is not being considered. While historically the Treasury Secretary served on the Board of Governors before the modern Fed structure was created, the proposal for one person to hold both roles concurrently is highly unusual in contemporary U.S. economic policy.</p>

          <p>State health officials in Louisiana have reported that five people have died this year from infections caused by Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacterium found in warm coastal waters. This number is a substantial increase from the state's decade-long average of just one death per year from the bacterium. There have been at least 26 reported infections in 2025, with most cases involving wound exposure to seawater. Researchers have warned that Vibrio infections are becoming more common as rising sea surface temperatures create more favorable conditions for the bacteria to thrive, posing a growing public health risk.</p>

President Trump has often expressed admiration for the British monarchy, and the planned invitation is seen as a gesture to further strengthen the "special relationship" between the two nations.</p>

The show highlighted the duo's dual strengths: their acclaimed work as film composers and their ability to unleash a raw, aggressive rock performance.

Siebert's expected dismissal is viewed by critics as a significant escalation in a campaign of political retribution against the president's rivals.

Attendees voiced frustrations over the cost of living and immigration, stating that Robinson speaks to the working class in a way mainstream politicians do not.

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace has been accompanied by lax seller vetting, leading to the sale of counterfeit and fraudulent products.

The report uncovered instances of shoppers receiving fake health supplements and beauty products, which can pose serious safety risks. While Walmart has recently tightened its policies for some categories, former employees stated that the company had previously prioritized growth and seller acquisition over stringent safety and verification protocols.</p>
