          <p>An explosion at a law enforcement training center in Monterey Park has killed three deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's arson and explosives detail. Sheriff Robert Luna described the event as the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, while assuring the public that it was an isolated incident with no ongoing threat. Investigators believe an explosive device, which was thought to have been rendered inert after being collected from a routine call, was the source of the fatal blast. The article identifies the three deceased deputies and their years of service.</p>

          <p>Key figures within the MAGA movement are rallying behind President Trump following a Wall Street Journal article about a letter he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, shifting their recent criticism over the handling of Epstein-related files. The article notes that prior to this, many supporters were angered by the administration's decision not to release more documents as promised. The controversial news story, which Trump denies and is suing over, has seemingly unified his base against the media and has been bolstered by his subsequent call to release grand jury testimony.</p>

          <p>Following significant pressure from the public and lawmakers, President Trump has requested the Department of Justice to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Pam Bondi formally filed a motion to release the transcripts, citing intense public interest in the case. This move comes as Trump simultaneously sues The Wall Street Journal for defamation over a report about a letter he allegedly sent to Epstein, and as bipartisan calls for transparency on the matter intensify. Lawmakers argue the release is crucial for restoring public trust in government.</p>

Despite a late-game dip in performance after building a significant lead, the Lions' early intensity was enough to secure the crucial win in Brisbane.

Rather than leading with abstinence pledges, they focus on broader themes of "dignity" and seeing people beyond their physical appearance.

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team has finally been awarded their world championship gold medals. The ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, correcting the historical record after the original winning US team was disqualified. The US was stripped of the title in 2008 when team member Antonio Pettigrew confessed to doping during that period. The British athletes—Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton—received a warm reception from the home crowd as they were presented with their long-overdue medals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US has reportedly revoked the visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges as part of a campaign to support former President Jair Bolsonaro. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets judges involved in the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who faces charges over an alleged coup attempt. This action follows President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which Brazilian President Lula has denounced as "unacceptable blackmail" and an affront to his country's sovereignty. The US intervention has been met with nationalist anger in Brazil.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that releasing the grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein would not be enough to satisfy his critics, whom he referred to as "troublemakers and radical left lunatics." In a post on Truth Social, he wrote, "It will always be more, more, more," suggesting the pressure campaign against him will not cease regardless of his actions. This comment comes a day after the Department of Justice, at Trump's request, moved to unseal the court documents amid growing calls for transparency from both his supporters and opponents.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential legal, economic, and market ramifications if President Trump were to attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Legal experts believe Trump likely lacks the authority to do so without "cause," a high legal bar that would almost certainly trigger a Supreme Court battle. Such a move would create unprecedented uncertainty, potentially undermining the Fed's independence and roiling financial markets. It could also backfire economically, as a perceived loss of Fed credibility might lead to higher, not lower, long-term interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway argues that "follow your passion" is the worst piece of career advice, often dispensed by people who are already wealthy. He suggests that instead of blindly pursuing a passion, individuals should find the intersection of what they are good at and what is commercially viable. Galloway's own journey involved realizing he lacked the skills for his first job and pivoting to entrepreneurship. The article echoes this sentiment with advice from Mastercard's CEO, who also recommends focusing on one's unique strengths to build a successful career.</p>

          <p>This essay explores the comeback of tanning, contrasting its early 2000s aesthetic appeal with its current ideological underpinnings. The article notes a renewed popularity of tanning across pop culture and among youth, despite well-known health risks. It connects this trend to a broader skepticism of mainstream health guidance, particularly within alternative-health and right-leaning political circles that champion sun exposure and question the safety of sunscreen. The modern tan has become a symbol of defiance against the scientific establishment, representing a return to a perceived "natural" state.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) and reducing its workforce by over 3,700 employees. The ORD, the agency's primary scientific arm, will be replaced by a new office, a move that officials claim will save nearly $750 million. Critics and union leaders have condemned the decision, warning that firing thousands of scientists and gutting the research division will "devastate public health" and cripple the EPA's ability to fulfill its mission of protecting human health and the environment.</p>
