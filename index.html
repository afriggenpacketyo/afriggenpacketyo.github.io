          <p>India announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in response to a militant attack last month in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which resulted in 26 deaths. The Indian Ministry of Defence stated that the operation, named "Operation Sindoor," targeted nine sites allegedly used for planning and directing terrorist attacks against India, while also claiming they avoided targeting Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused India of violating his country's territorial sovereignty and attacking its civilian population, resulting in 26 deaths and 46 injuries, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war and promised a strong response.</p>

          <p>Bank of America strategists report that U.S. equities experienced significant outflows of $8.9 billion in the week leading up to April 30, triggered by President Trump's tariff policies. Investors are reallocating capital to European and Japanese equities, which saw inflows of $3.4 billion and $4.4 billion respectively, indicating a move towards perceived safer markets amidst trade uncertainties. Interestingly, cryptocurrencies and high yield bonds also saw inflows, suggesting a continued appetite for risk among some investors, while gold and U.S. Treasury bonds experienced outflows as investors sought potentially higher returns elsewhere.

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a reduction in its 2025 sales growth forecast, citing increased competition from copycat drug compounders impacting sales of its popular Wegovy weight loss drug. Despite this adjustment, the company reported a first-quarter net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner ($4.4 billion), surpassing analysts' expectations. Sales of Wegovy rose 83% year-on-year, although slightly below analyst predictions, while Ozempic sales exceeded forecasts, and the company now projects sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous estimate of 16% to 24%.</p>

          <p>Motorbike racer Morgan McLaren-Wood, who sustained injuries in a multi-rider crash at Oulton Park that resulted in the deaths of Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson, described the incident as chaotic and unavoidable due to the track's tight layout and limited run-off space. The British Supersport Championship race saw 11 riders involved in the collision, leaving another rider with a broken neck and several others with minor injuries, while McLaren-Wood emphasized the lack of options for riders to avoid the crash, highlighting the inherent dangers of the track.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that losing access to China's artificial intelligence (AI) market would be a significant setback for the company, as the market is projected to reach $50 billion in the next two to three years. Huang highlighted that selling to China would not only contribute to U.S. tax revenue but also generate job opportunities, and these remarks come as Nvidia faces increasingly stringent export controls from the U.S. government, including restrictions on its China-tailored H20 AI chips, and the company is seeking to maintain its presence in China, which accounted for approximately 14% of its revenue last financial year.</p>

Finley's condition is so rare that doctors are considering presenting it to a medical journal, as they believe he may be one of the only people whose body reacts to lipids in this way. Finley has plans to abseil down a tower block at Southend Hospital on 16 May to raise money for the Mid and South Essex Hospitals Charity.</p>

This has been criticized as "lop sided" and simply, "taxing British workers more, taxing Indian workers less."</p>

          <p>Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will use "rage, anger, frustration" and "a bad feeling in the tummy" to try and overturn the 1-0 Champions League semi-final first-leg deficit against Paris St-Germain. Arsenal have not scored in any of their past seven semi-final matches in all competitions (losing five and drawing two). Thomas Partey's return to Arsenal's midfield could be decisive, as could Ousmane Dembele's fitness after only training since Monday. Then there is the tactical battle, won by Luis Enrique in the first leg but, thanks to Mikel Arteta's mid-game tweaks, perhaps set up to swing in Arsenal's favour.</p>
