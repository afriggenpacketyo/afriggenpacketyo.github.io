          <p>The families of 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, the two children killed in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, have released their first public statements. Fletcher's father described the shooter as a "coward" and remembered his son's love for family and sports, asking for empathy from the public. Harper's family expressed their profound grief while urging political leaders to take meaningful action on gun violence and the mental health crisis to prevent similar tragedies. Both families thanked the community for its support and requested privacy as they navigate their devastating losses.</p>

The protest was organized by a group called No Azure for Apartheid, which demands Microsoft end its support for Israel amid the conflict in Gaza. A company spokesperson confirmed the terminations, citing serious breaches of company policy and unlawful entry into executive offices. The incident follows other protests by the group and a recent report alleging the Israeli military used Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure for surveillance of Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders has proposed a new model for compensating college football players, suggesting they should be paid directly for participating in the College Football Playoff. Sanders argues that instead of conferences receiving large payouts, the money should go to the athletes who generate the revenue, creating a more equitable system similar to NFL playoff bonuses. This idea was discussed in an interview alongside former coach Nick Saban, who also expressed concerns about the current state of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. Both coaches agree that more structure is needed to ensure the system benefits players' long-term futures.</p>

          <p>Florida executed 59-year-old Curtis Windom for the 1992 murders of his girlfriend, her mother, and another man, marking the state's 11th execution of the year. This number sets a new record for executions in Florida in the modern era, surpassing the previous high of eight. Windom's final appeals to the U.S. and Florida Supreme Courts, which argued he had incompetent legal representation during his trial, were rejected. Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a steady stream of death warrants in 2025, with a 12th execution already scheduled for September, continuing a trend of increased capital punishment in the state.</p>

Zhao suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a clear willingness to embrace Web3 technologies but needs to move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity. One key recommendation he made was to expand the limited number of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges to foster a more dynamic market.</p>

According to officials and parents, as the attack began, these students immediately pushed their younger "buddies"—part of a school mentorship program—under the pews for cover. This selfless act meant that many of the older children were more exposed to the gunfire, with one reportedly taking a shotgun blast to the back to shield another student. Their bravery, along with the quick actions of teachers, is credited with preventing an even greater loss of life.</p>

With EV prices already declining due to softer demand, leasing has become a popular option, accounting for 70% of EV transactions in July.

The ruling is a setback for Lake's efforts to significantly scale back VOA's operations, which have already seen massive layoffs and the closure of most language services.

          <p>An asylum seeker housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, reports feeling "in the dark" about his future as the site faces closure following a High Court injunction. The hotel's use for housing migrants has been the subject of large anti-immigration protests and counter-demonstrations, creating a hostile environment for residents. The man, who fled Somalia, described intimidation from some locals and expressed a complex understanding of their anger, admitting he would likely feel the same if his home country faced mass migration. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule on the injunction, which could force the eviction of 138 asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit, allowing families of 9/11 victims to continue their legal case against the kingdom. The lawsuit alleges that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles of certain Saudi individuals in assisting the hijackers, which the kingdom failed to sufficiently rebut. This decision paves the way for the case to potentially proceed to trial, keeping alive the families' pursuit of accountability.</p>

          <p>As Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cracks down on illegal palm oil plantations to reclaim deforested land, global demand remains a key driver of the industry's environmental impact. This opinion piece argues that China, as a major importer, is uniquely positioned to influence Indonesia's palm oil sector toward more sustainable practices. By leveraging its market power, China can encourage responsible sourcing and help shift the economic incentives away from destructive deforestation. This approach could help rewrite the future of an industry that is crucial to Indonesia's economy but has come at a significant environmental cost.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. trade rule known as "de minimis," which has allowed low-value packages to enter the country duty-free for nearly 90 years, is being suspended by a Trump administration executive order. Previously, goods valued under $800 were exempt from import taxes, a loophole that greatly benefited online retailers like Shein and Temu that ship cheap products directly from overseas. Starting Friday, all shipments will face an import tax, which will initially be a flat rate before being tied to tariffs of the origin country. This policy change is expected to increase prices for American consumers on many imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>

Departing officials have cited the "weaponizing of public health" and an inability to brief the secretary on key issues, suggesting that policy changes are being driven by politics rather than data.
