        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency in Germany reported a record number of complaints in 2024, indicating a growing problem with discrimination. Racism remains the most common form, with over 3,800 reports, while sexism is also on the rise, particularly in the workplace, where women face sexual harassment and career disadvantages. The Commissioner for Anti-Discrimination emphasizes the need for legal reform to protect individuals from discrimination by state institutions, as current laws offer better protection in supermarkets than in schools or government offices. The commissioner argues that discrimination harms the economy, democracy, and the constitutional state as a whole, and decisive action is needed. Optimism is seen in the increased awareness of rights and willingness to stand up against discrimination.</p>

          <p>Officials have released details about an attack in Boulder, Colorado, where a suspect threw Molotov cocktails at a peaceful demonstration supporting Israeli hostages in Gaza, injuring 12 people. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been taken into custody and is facing multiple felony charges, including a federal hate crime charge. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine!" during the attack and had 16 unused Molotov cocktails within reach at the time of his arrest. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism, and the suspect allegedly stated his desire to kill all Zionist people and had been planning the attack for a year.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, starting in 2027. This deal will support the plant's continued operation and relicensing, preventing its potential closure due to the expiration of zero-emission credits. The agreement expands Clinton's output by 30 megawatts and contributes to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity. This move aligns Meta with other tech giants investing in nuclear energy to meet the increasing power demands of data centers, as the industry is hoping that SMRs can be a more cost-effective way to scale up nuclear power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Atlantic hurricane season underway, forecasters predict above-average activity, heightening concerns as NOAA faces staffing shortages and budget cuts under the Trump administration. Warm Caribbean waters and the ENSO cycle are contributing factors to the expected increase in hurricanes, with at least three storms projected to reach Category 3 or higher. Despite the Commerce Secretary's claims of preparedness, climate scientists warn that NOAA's reduced workforce and FEMA's diminished resources could compromise the accuracy of forecasts and the effectiveness of disaster response. The White House's proposed budget cuts for NOAA further exacerbate the situation, raising fears of needless loss of life due to understaffed weather forecast offices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether revitalizing manufacturing can help the American heartland catch up with prosperous "superstar cities." Manufacturing is considered special due to the good-paying jobs it provides, particularly for those without a college education, and its potential to foster economic growth in struggling regions. Manufacturing is a "tradable sector" that brings new wealth into a community, creating additional jobs and supporting local businesses. While manufacturing, especially advanced manufacturing, can be a seed for greater economic prosperity for local communities, there is a debate over whether politicians can effectively revitalize this sector and whether its regional effects will unfold as desired.

Officials reported that 78 escapees have been recaptured, with one prisoner killed and three security officials wounded in a shootout. The inmates attacked guards, seized weapons, and fled toward a nearby residential area, prompting police to conduct raids and alert residents via mosque loudspeakers. The Sindh Chief Minister urged the escapees to return voluntarily, but warned they could face terror charges if arrested by police.</p>

Sources indicate that the politicization of the water industry was a major deterrent for investors. An independent review of the water industry found that the sector in England and Wales is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment.</p>

There has also been an increase in miscarriages, stillbirths, and congenital abnormalities. Basic medical supplies, including painkillers and hygiene products, are lacking, and women are sometimes giving birth in tents or shelters without medical assistance. A nurse who worked at a hospital in Gaza noted that women who give birth vaginally are typically sent home three to four hours afterward, while those who have had C-sections are discharged after 24 hours due to overcrowding.</p>

          <p>The far-right US publisher Passage Press, now part of Foundation Publishing Group, is connected to Network Press, whose only title is an “effective accelerationist” manifesto by tech-right venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. This illuminates efforts to disseminate ideologically charged material as art, raising questions about its place in the culture wars waged by the Trump administration. Lisi, a publisher and director, spent years in Los Angeles’s left-leaning literary scene, but has emerged as a player in a far-right cultural push. Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said it was “another example of the far right moving to directly impact culture, and especially young people, with extremist and anti-democratic beliefs”.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the inconsistency and frequent reversals in President Trump's policies, particularly in trade, foreign policy, and immigration. This "un-happening" trend creates uncertainty for businesses and investors, hindering economic growth and stability. While Trump's ability to backtrack and contradict himself may contribute to his political resilience, it undermines confidence in his administration's agenda. The author suggests that Trump's approach resembles a denial-of-service attack on a functioning government rather than a strategic plan.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential link between the decline of deep reading and the current state of political dysfunction. It discusses the theory that digital media is reviving orality, leading to a shift away from abstract thought and rational discourse. While acknowledging the striking analogies between ancient oral cultures and today's digital one, the author questions whether declining deep literacy is the driving force behind illiberal politics. The author argues that the relationship between reading, abstract thought, and political ideology is complex and not always straightforward.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security’s “sanctuary jurisdiction list” has been criticized for its inaccuracy and sloppiness, exemplified by its inclusion of Huntington Beach, a city that opposes sanctuary status, while omitting Santa Ana, a known sanctuary city. This flawed list, intended to penalize sanctuary jurisdictions, has been removed from the Homeland Security website due to its numerous errors. Critics argue that the list reflects the Trump administration's obsession with illegal immigration and its willingness to disregard facts and due process. The sloppiness is seen as a deliberate tactic to instill fear and advance a hard-line immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues in favor of adding work requirements to Medicaid, drawing on the author's 46 years of experience in America’s job training system. The author contends that work rules provide a push for individuals on welfare and other benefit programs to enter the job world, offering support networks for job placement and retention. The author emphasizes that previous implementations of work requirements have resulted in increased employment and other life benefits for participants, their families, and local communities. The proposed Medicaid work rules exclude certain recipients, and the author believes America has a vast workforce network ready to provide job placement services. (not investment advice)</p>
