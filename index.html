          <p>Following a powerful earthquake off the coast of Russia, Hawaiian officials urged residents in coastal areas to evacuate to higher ground, leading to significant traffic congestion. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported waves several feet high hitting the islands of Maui and Oahu, prompting urgent action to protect lives. While the initial warning was later downgraded to an advisory, many residents, some still recovering from the trauma of past wildfires, took no chances and prepared for the worst by moving inland for safety. The event highlighted ongoing concerns about traffic management during emergencies on the islands.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming report on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to show the economy grew at a modest but sturdy pace in the second quarter, despite fears of a downturn from President Trump's tariffs. Economists anticipate a rebound from the previous quarter's contraction, suggesting the economy has remained resilient with low unemployment and stable consumer spending. However, the article notes that the GDP figures can be distorted by trade policy, as a drop in imports could artificially inflate the growth number. The data arrives just before a Federal Reserve meeting where interest rates are expected to hold steady. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been ruled out of the fifth and final Test match against India due to a shoulder injury he struggled with during the previous game. In his absence, Ollie Pope will lead the side, and Jacob Bethell will be brought in to bat at number six. The team has also made three changes to its bowling lineup, introducing seamers Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, and Jamie Overton. The loss of Stokes is a significant blow, given his recent strong performances with both bat and ball.</p>

          <p>The women-only dating safety app Tea has suspended its direct messaging feature following a significant cybersecurity breach that exposed thousands of user images, posts, and private conversations. The U.S.-based app, which has 1.6 million users, confirmed that sensitive direct messages were accessed during the incident, which reportedly included discussions about personal matters. The company is currently investigating the hack, working to identify the affected individuals, and plans to offer them free identity protection services to mitigate potential harm.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that Elon Musk's rightward political turn has negatively impacted how U.S. liberals view not just Tesla, but the entire electric vehicle market. The study, published in Nature, found that while liberal support for Tesla plummeted, their general intention to buy any EV also declined into negative territory. This suggests Musk's persona has become so synonymous with the product category that his political alignment is dragging down perceptions of EVs in general, an unusual impact for a CEO to have on an entire industry.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has substantially raised its 2025 GDP growth forecast for China, marking the largest upward revision for any economy in its latest report. The IMF attributed the improved outlook to stronger-than-expected economic activity in the first half of the year and a significant reduction in U.S.-China tariffs. A key factor was the robust growth in China's exports to diversified partners in regions like Southeast Asia and Europe, which helped offset a decline in shipments to the United States.

          <p>A ground search is underway in northern Pakistan for Laura Dahlmeier, a celebrated German Olympic biathlon champion, who went missing after being caught in a rockslide. The 31-year-old was ascending the 6,069-meter Laila Peak with a partner when the accident occurred at a high altitude of around 5,700 meters. Rescue efforts, involving international climbers and local porters, have been hampered by difficult weather.

          <p>Health experts are cautioning that many common prescription drugs, including those for high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression, can increase a person's risk of overheating during a heatwave. These medications can interfere with the body's natural cooling mechanisms, such as sweating, thirst sensation, and blood flow regulation, making users more susceptible to heat-related illness. Doctors stress that patients should continue taking their prescribed medications but must be extra vigilant about staying cool, hydrated, and out of the sun.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Center for Election Innovation & Research (CEIR) confirms that voting by non-U.S. citizens is a minuscule problem, despite widespread political rhetoric suggesting otherwise. After reviewing public data from states across the country, the research found that even in states actively searching for ineligible voters, the number of confirmed cases is extremely small. The report concludes that most allegations arise from misunderstandings, bureaucratic errors, or outright fabrications, not coordinated fraudulent efforts to influence elections.</p>

          <p>This article traces the fascinating etymology of the word 'dude,' revealing its origins in 1880s New York City as a term for overly fashionable, 'dandy'-like young men. It later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting 'dude ranches' out West, before being adopted by Black and Mexican American communities in the mid-20th century as a term of in-group solidarity. The word was eventually popularized by California surf and skate culture in the 1980s and 90s, transforming into the familiar, versatile term it is today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on Great Tits, a common European songbird, reveals that some avian pairs effectively 'divorce' by ceasing to associate with each other after the breeding season concludes. Using radio tags to track individual birds, scientists at the University of Oxford found that while some couples remained faithful through the winter, others drifted apart. This behavior suggests they were already disinvesting in their prior relationship and potentially building new bonds for the next spring, highlighting the complex social lives of animals.</p>
