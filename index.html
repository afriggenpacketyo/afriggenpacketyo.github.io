          <p>During a traffic stop in central Ohio, police encountered a pet raccoon named "Chewy" holding a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth while sitting in the driver's seat. The officer searched the vehicle and discovered methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and additional used methamphetamine pipes. The driver, Victoria Vidal, was arrested and charged with drug possession and paraphernalia charges. The raccoon was unharmed, and Vidal had the necessary documents to legally own the animal, as permits are required in Ohio to keep raccoons domestically.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts Ph.D. student, from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont. Ozturk was arrested after her student visa was revoked, with authorities citing her involvement in associations that allegedly undermined U.S. foreign policy. The court's decision mandates the transfer within a week, setting the stage for a bail hearing in Vermont. Ozturk's lawyers are challenging her arrest as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, arguing that the revocation of her visa and subsequent detention are unjust.</p>

          <p>The National Audit Office (NAO) reports that the cost of asylum seeker accommodation in the UK is projected to triple to £15.3 billion over ten years, far exceeding the Home Office's initial estimate of £4.5 billion. The increase is largely due to the rising number of asylum seekers housed in hotels, which account for three-quarters of accommodation spending despite housing only a third of asylum seekers. The NAO notes that private providers may profit more from using hotels, and highlights that three companies have made £383m in profits from asylum accommodation contracts between 2019 and 2024.</p>

The analysis points out potential challenges for the U.S., including Rwanda's limited capacity, legal hurdles, and the possibility of migrants being moved to other countries after arriving in Rwanda, as occurred under a previous Israeli deal.</p>

          <p>A Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report reveals that the IRS has lost nearly one-third of its tax auditors due to budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency. As of March 2025, the agency's workforce had decreased by 11%, with revenue agents experiencing a 31% reduction. This report coincides with President Trump's fiscal 2026 budget request, which proposes further IRS budget cuts to curb enforcement activities. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the reduced spending, citing $2 billion in IT budget cuts without operational disruptions.</p>

          <p>The capitals of Utah and Idaho have adopted new official city flags in response to state laws prohibiting the display of unofficial flags on government property. Salt Lake City approved flags with the rainbow colors of the Pride flag, the transgender Pride flag, and a symbol for Juneteenth, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and a flag promoting organ donation as official city flags. These actions are seen as responses to state measures aimed at preventing the display of flags supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people.</p>

          <p>Target is facing challenges on multiple fronts, including boycotts related to DEI initiatives, increased competition from Amazon, Walmart and Costco, and vulnerability to declining consumer spending. The company's decision to scale back DEI programs led to boycotts and a decline in foot traffic. Operational issues, such as excess inventory and staff shortages, have also contributed to flat revenue and a declining share price, causing customers to shift spending to competitors.</p>

          <p>Right-wing intellectuals are arguing that American culture and society have become fundamentally hostile to people like them, leading to the belief that the right's embrace of Trumpian authoritarianism is a defensive response against a near-omnipotent cultural left. The article suggests that this caricature of the country has taken deep root among right-wing elites, shaping policy in areas ranging from immigration to education. This is facilitated by the internal homogeneity of conservative spaces within liberal fields, leading to groupthink and the caricaturing of opponents.</p>
