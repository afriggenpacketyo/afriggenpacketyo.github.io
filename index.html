        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's second-quarter net income fell significantly due to weaker crude oil prices and a financial loss related to its acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the overall profit decline, the company's adjusted earnings per share surpassed Wall Street expectations. The completed $53 billion Hess deal, which adds key assets in Guyana and the U.S., is expected to boost Chevron's earnings later in the year. The company's global production increased, driven by strong performance in the U.S. Permian Basin.</p>

          <p>Rising global temperatures are making mountaineering significantly more dangerous by melting the snow and ice that act as a natural adhesive on mountains, leading to increased rockfalls and avalanches. This article details how expeditions in regions like the Karakoram are facing unprecedented risks, forcing changes in climbing schedules and routes. The trend also threatens the local economies in Pakistan and Nepal that depend on mountain tourism, adding an economic dimension to the environmental crisis.</p>

          <p>A new provision in President Trump's recent tax legislation introduces a valuable charitable deduction for the 90% of filers who do not itemize. Starting in 2026, single filers can deduct up to $1,000 and joint filers up to $2,000 for cash donations to qualifying charities. Financial experts advise taxpayers to keep meticulous records, including written acknowledgements from the organizations, to properly claim this new tax break. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone held steady at 2.0% in July, slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast by economists, according to data from Eurostat. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items, also remained unchanged at 2.3%, suggesting persistent price pressures. This data makes it less likely that the European Central Bank will resume interest rate cuts soon, with markets anticipating the bank will hold rates steady at its next meeting.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while much of what Donald Trump says can be dismissed, his interest in aesthetics and beauty is a noteworthy and welcome quality in a political leader. The author cites Trump's executive order promoting classical federal architecture, his criticism of "ugly" wind turbines, and his initiative to rebuild New York's Penn Station in its original grand style. The article suggests that this concern for visual beauty is a rare and refreshing focus in modern politics.</p>

          <p>The German military has commenced airdropping humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip to address the severe humanitarian crisis. This development comes as international pressure on Israel mounts, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated the UK may recognize a Palestinian state if Israel does not take significant steps toward peace. German officials, however, caution that airdrops are a limited solution and cannot replace secure land-based aid delivery.</p>

          <p>This article explores the diplomatic shift by major Western powers like France and the UK, which are planning to formally recognize a state of Palestine. This move, reflecting global outrage over the war in Gaza, is largely symbolic but carries significant diplomatic weight, further isolating the U.S. and Israel on the issue. While recognition would allow for the exchange of full ambassadors, experts note it may not dramatically change dynamics at the UN Security Council or on the ground without other concrete actions.</p>
