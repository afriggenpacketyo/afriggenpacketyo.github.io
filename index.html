          <p>Tom Aspinall of Manchester has been upgraded to the undisputed heavyweight champion after Jon Jones officially announced his retirement from UFC. Dana White confirmed the decision after a UFC Fight Night in Azerbaijan, ending seven months of uncertainty in the heavyweight division. Aspinall is now the third Briton to become a UFC champion, having spent 19 months as the interim champion. Jones, considered one of the best mixed martial artists, had previously claimed the heavyweight title in March 2023 but chose not to accept the UFC's offer to fight Aspinall. Aspinall expressed excitement about the heavyweight division's future and is expected to defend his title this summer or early autumn, likely against Ciryl Gane.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German passports has doubled in 2024, making Turkey second only to Syria in the number of citizens naturalizing in Germany. This increase is attributed to Germany's growing attractiveness for Turks seeking opportunities for life, work, and study. Citizenship offers practical advantages, such as avoiding bureaucratic hurdles and gaining political influence. The 2024 citizenship reforms, allowing dual citizenship, have further incentivized Turkish migrants to seek German passports while retaining their Turkish identity and ties. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey have also contributed to this trend, as individuals seek greater freedoms and economic stability in Germany.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched precision strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, with the goal of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stopping the nuclear threat. Two senior Defense Department officials confirmed that American B-2 bombers struck Fordo using GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, while Tomahawk missiles launched from submarines targeted Natanz and Isfahan. The U.S. has reportedly reached out to Iran diplomatically, stating that the strikes are the extent of their plans and that regime change is not intended. The strikes have elicited mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers, with some Republicans supporting the action and Democrats criticizing the lack of congressional authorization. This marks a significant escalation in the conflict between the U.S. and Iran.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's decision to launch air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites marks a significant departure from previous U.S. policy, which has historically avoided direct attacks on Iranian territory. It notes that while the strikes may have positive outcomes, such as disrupting Iran's nuclear program, they also carry risks, including potential retaliation and the possibility of driving Iran's nuclear activities underground. The piece explores potential Iranian responses, ranging from conventional strikes to asymmetric attacks, and questions whether the strikes were a strategic miscalculation. It concludes by emphasizing the need for vigilance and a clear strategy in the face of potential escalation.</p>

Some lawmakers, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, opposed the strikes, arguing it is not America's fight, while others, including Ro Khanna, called for Congress to vote on a resolution to limit Trump's war powers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent claim of a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran was a deceptive tactic to catch the Iranians off guard before initiating air strikes on their nuclear sites. The decision to bomb Iran's nuclear sites was made after a meeting with national security advisors, culminating in a declaration that the facilities had been "completely and totally obliterated." This action escalates the confrontation with Iran, potentially leading to counterattacks and economic disruptions, despite intelligence assessments suggesting Iran was not actively building a nuclear weapon. The operation was closely coordinated with Israel, and the administration is bracing for potential Iranian retaliation, which could take the form of cyberattacks or attacks on U.S. assets in the region.</p>

          <p>Decades after enlisting in the military during the Vietnam War, Dennis Snyder and Richard Hill, now in their 80s, received their high school diplomas alongside the Muscatine High class of 2025. Snyder, who volunteered for the Navy before his junior year, always regretted missing his graduation. Through Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program, these veterans were able to finally close that chapter. Snyder shared that he dedicated this honor to his high school friends who did not return from the war, highlighting the significance of this recognition for veterans across the country.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The non-invasive "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology. Trials in Hokkaido, Japan, successfully identified tumors and precancerous cells among residents, leading to early treatment. The test kit is particularly vital in areas with sparse medical resources, offering a convenient and effective means of early cancer detection.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have utilized mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Led by Professor Li Lei, the study redefines yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The four phases, named 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, each reflect a unique metabolic state, similar to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine. This model highlights the balance between passive and active forces, offering new insights into molecular life mechanisms.</p>
