          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer, which required the surgical removal of his bladder. Speaking at a press conference alongside his medical team, Sanders emotionally shared that the procedure was successful and he is now considered cancer-free. The revelation explained his recent absence from public view, and he confirmed his intention to continue coaching the team for the upcoming season. He had not previously disclosed the diagnosis to his team or the public.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction, arguing it should be overturned based on a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida. The defense brief contends the government has an obligation to honor the deal, which they claim provided Maxwell with immunity from criminal charges. Prosecutors have maintained that the agreement was only applicable in Florida and did not prevent charges from being filed in New York. Maxwell's lawyers argue the NPA's terms were unqualified and not geographically limited, making her subsequent prosecution unjust.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is facing a federal lawsuit for failing to release a legal memorandum that reportedly approved Donald Trump's acceptance of a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar's government. The Freedom of the Press Foundation filed the lawsuit, arguing the public deserves scrutiny over the arrangement, which has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans as a potential violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause. The memo in question was reportedly signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, a former lobbyist for Qatar, and concluded the gift was legally permissible. The DOJ has not produced the document despite granting the request expedited processing.</p>

          <p>Portuguese forward João Félix is reportedly set to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, a move that many analysts see as a departure from top-tier European football. Once the third most expensive transfer in history, the 25-year-old has struggled to consistently fulfill his early potential during stints at major clubs like Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, and Barcelona. Despite his talent, he never scored more than 10 goals in a season after leaving his home club, Benfica. This transfer is viewed by some observers as a concession that he may not reach the elite level once predicted for his career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more Americans face financial strain from high interest rates and inflation, personal bankruptcy filings are on the rise, but the process carries significant risks. A major consequence is a severe and long-lasting hit to one's credit score, making future borrowing for homes or cars difficult for up to a decade. Depending on the type of bankruptcy filed, individuals could also lose valuable assets, such as a second car or investment properties, which may be sold off to repay creditors. Before pursuing bankruptcy, it is crucial to explore alternatives like debt consolidation or settlement programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's legal team has filed a motion to compel a swift deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch in their $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday. Citing Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health issues, Trump's lawyers argue for an expedited testimony within 15 days, suggesting he may be unavailable to testify if the case proceeds at a normal pace. Murdoch's legal team opposes the request, and a judge has ordered them to respond by early August.</p>

Planned Parenthood had argued that losing these funds, which cover services like birth control and cancer screenings, would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics and affect over a million patients.

Financial experts advise homeowners to carefully compare the two products, as HELOCs offer a variable-rate credit line while home equity loans provide a fixed-rate lump sum.

This figure represents approximately two-thirds of the continent's population and stands in stark contrast to a global downward trend in hunger. The report, produced by five U.N. agencies, notes that the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average. Factors driving this crisis include conflict, climate change, and the failure of agricultural production to keep pace with population growth, particularly in regions like Sudan and the Sahel.</p>

The law, passed in September, allows individuals who can trace their lineage to the transatlantic slave trade to claim Beninese citizenship. This initiative is part of Benin's broader effort to reconcile with its historical role in the slave trade, promote 'memorial tourism' to sites like the Door of No Return, and reconnect with the global Black diaspora. The process is open to anyone who can provide proof of ancestry.</p>

          <p>During Disability Pride Month, Berkeley activist and artist Maya Morya Selkie Scott is promoting the "Disability Justice Community Stories Quilt Project." The project invites people to create individual panels that share their personal stories of love, struggle, and resilience, which are then woven into a collective quilt. Inspired by the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the project aims to make the disabled community more visible and honor its history of activism and civil disobedience. The growing quilt has already been displayed at protests and events across the country, serving as an educational tool to advance disability rights and foster connection.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's stock received downgrades from both Mizuho and Guggenheim, with analysts at both firms citing the company's high valuation following a significant rally. Despite the downgrade to neutral, Mizuho increased its price target, acknowledging potential for margin expansion, while Guggenheim noted the stock remains attractive for long-term investors. The stock has more than doubled since its April lows, prompting a more cautious short-term outlook from the financial firms. The analysis reflects a view that while the company's fundamentals are strong, its recent stock performance has made it fully valued. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Michigan are seeking terrorism and attempted murder charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing 11 people at a Walmart in Traverse City.

Speaking in Scotland, Trump stated that a single rate for the rest of the world is necessary because it is not feasible to negotiate hundreds of individual agreements. The announcement comes just days before the administration's August 1 tariff deadline, affecting numerous countries that have yet to secure a deal.</p>

The groups' reports allege a "coordinated, deliberate action to destroy Palestinian society," citing the widespread displacement, bombing, and starvation of Gaza's population. Israel maintains its actions are justified as self-defense against Hamas and that there is no genocidal intent, pointing to the aid it has allowed into the territory.</p>

Bronze played 598 minutes across six games, a testament to her resilience and the work of the Lionesses' medical team.

The guidance also allows for the organization of prayer groups during non-work hours. This move is part of a broader effort to expand religious expression in the federal workplace, aligning with a previous executive order to combat perceived anti-Christian bias in government.</p>

Despite widespread poverty and corruption, Biya has maintained power by skillfully playing competitors against each other and ensuring no single figure in the military or opposition becomes a viable threat. His ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement, remains dominant, and the country's simple-majority electoral system heavily favors his incumbency. Critics argue real power now lies with a small circle of aides, who maintain the status quo to preserve their own privileges.</p>
