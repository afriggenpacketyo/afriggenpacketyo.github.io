            <p>Amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia, Ukraine has seen a surge in DIY drone production, with ordinary citizens turning into drone makers to support the military. These operations, often run from makeshift workshops, produce attack drones equipped with explosives, highlighting Ukraine's innovative approach to warfare. While Ukraine is at the forefront of drone technology, it lags behind Russia in production volume, emphasizing the need for domestically sourced parts and increased manufacturing capabilities. Volunteers, including former baristas and dancers, are driven by a desire to contribute to the war effort, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of the Ukrainian people in the face of adversity.</p>

His comments come amidst reports of a Tennessee Volunteers quarterback seeking to renegotiate his NIL deal for a substantial increase.

            <p>President Trump's insistence on high tariffs has created global uncertainty, with panelists discussing the potential fallout from his policies. Trump believes that trade imbalances mean America is being taken advantage of and that tariffs are the key to strengthening the American economy. Ashley Parker notes that Trump's views on trade and immigration have been consistent, driven by a desire to prevent others from exploiting the United States. Economists, business leaders, and some Republicans have warned that the tariffs could lead to a recession and inflation.</p>

Critics argue that this is a violation of constitutional rights and that the state's regressive tax policies contribute to the lack of funding for education.

            <p>Iran and the US are engaged in "indirect talks" in Oman concerning Iran's nuclear program, with Omani officials mediating between the two parties. Iran's foreign minister expressed hope for an initial understanding if the US approaches the talks with an equal stance. The discussions focus on de-escalating regional tensions, prisoner exchanges, and potential agreements to ease sanctions in exchange for controlling Iran's nuclear program. President Trump has warned Iran against acquiring nuclear weapons and has suggested possible military action if negotiations fail.</p>

            <p>High winds and sandstorms prompted Beijing to cancel hundreds of flights and close public parks, as massive gales felled hundreds of trees and damaged buildings. Beijing's two major airports canceled a significant number of flights, with warnings of more severe weather on the way. The Universal Studios theme park and historical sites were closed as a precaution.

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies have sparked turmoil in financial markets, raising concerns about a potential US default and economic instability. The president's flip-flop on tariffs led to a sell-off in the bond market, increasing the cost of borrowing for the US government. Economists warn of a potential recession, and the possibility of a US default has increased. The article suggests that Trump's actions are driven by impulsiveness rather than strategy, leading to economic uncertainty and potentially weakening the US in the long term.

            <p>While Americanisms often infiltrate British English, a growing trend sees British terms gaining popularity in the US, particularly among Gen Z. A study identified words like "bonkers," "queue," and "cheeky" as commonly used Britishisms in American English, driven by social media and streaming services. This linguistic exchange is generally welcomed, with some finding British terms more vivid or useful. Despite this cross-pollination, distinct differences between British and American English dialects persist, ensuring their continued individuality.</p>

            <p>An editorial argues that Congress should reclaim its constitutional power over tariffs in response to President Trump's erratic trade policies. The author contends that Trump's actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are a dubious justification for imposing tariffs and that Congress should cancel or legalize his existing tariffs. The editorial warns that allowing a president to wield such power invites corruption and undermines the rule of law. It calls on citizens to pressure their representatives to reclaim the tariff power and prevent the president from behaving like a king.</p>
