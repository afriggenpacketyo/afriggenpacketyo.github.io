          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that U.S. chip export controls are a "failure" and are causing more harm to American businesses than to China. He mentioned that the restrictions have reduced Nvidia's market share in China from 95% to 50%, pushing China to accelerate its own chip production. Huang's comments reflect the delicate balance Nvidia must maintain amidst the ongoing tech cold war between the U.S. and China. The Chinese Commerce Ministry has criticized the U.S. policy as "overreaching" and "bullying," demanding the White House to correct its mistakes.</p>

          <p>An article explores the controversial idea gaining ground within the Christian right that empathy is a sin, particularly empathy towards those with liberal perspectives or who are part of marginalized communities. This concept, popularized by figures like pastor Joe Rigney, argues that empathy can be a tool of manipulation used by progressives. The article traces the spread of this idea through various media outlets and political figures, including Elon Musk, while also highlighting the pushback from religious leaders and others who view empathy as a fundamental virtue. The article notes that this view is rooted in toxic masculinity and a demonization of empathy as feminine.</p>

          <p>Several nations, including those that have supported Israel, condemned Israeli troops for firing "warning shots" near visiting diplomats in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian Authority accused Israeli troops of deliberately shooting at the delegation near Jenin, while the Israeli military expressed regret for the "inconvenience." The diplomatic convoy had reportedly strayed from the approved route and entered a restricted zone. The incident has further strained Israel-Europe ties, already tested by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and recent murders in Washington D.C.</p>

The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket.

          <p>As Canada navigates a political transition with a new prime minister, the province of Alberta is considering holding a referendum on whether to secede from the country. Fueling the movement is a sense of unfair limitation on the province's oil and gas resources and a perceived hostility from the federal government. Premier Danielle Smith claims she is not personally in favor of Alberta breaking away from Canada but seeks to radically renegotiate Albertaâ€™s relationship with the federal government. The new rules drastically lower the bar for constitutional referendum petitions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Freedom Caucus met to reach a deal to advance Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act." The meeting followed unsuccessful negotiations with hard-liners, who remain divided over the bill. Sticking points include Medicaid work requirements and a cap on state and local tax deductions. House leadership sources indicate that Johnson aims to put the bill on the floor to force holdouts to take a stance, though hard-liners are pledging to vote against it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is giving "very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public." These government-sponsored enterprises are key in America's housing financial system. Trump plans to discuss the matter with his economic advisors and make a decision soon. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from lenders and bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, providing liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market.</p>

          <p>House Republicans made several last-minute changes to their tax cut and immigration bill in an effort to win over GOP holdouts. Revisions include removing sections authorizing the sale of public lands in Nevada and Utah, renaming "MAGA" accounts to "Trump" accounts, and accelerating the implementation of Medicaid work requirements. The revised bill also quadruples the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 for households with incomes up to $500,000 and deregulates gun silencers by removing them from the national registry.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. The government highlighted a "300,000 drop in net migration since the election" and promised to "further reduce net migration" by implementing its measures set out in the Immigration White Paper last week.</p>

Brazilian counterintelligence officers are now considering this audacious possibility, which would represent an extraordinary level of foresight and mission commitment.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives narrowly passed a sweeping tax and spending bill that would enact much of President Donald Trumpâ€™s policy agenda. The bill, projected to add $3.8tn to the federal debt over the next decade, passed in a 215-214 vote. The legislation extends corporate and individual tax cuts passed in 2017, cancels many green-energy incentives, and tightens eligibility for health and food programs. Investors are increasingly selling the dollar and other US assets due to concerns over the US debt and Trumpâ€™s tariff moves.</p>
