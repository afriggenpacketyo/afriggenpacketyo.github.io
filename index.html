          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino provided an update on the agency's operations, emphasizing the focus on removing dangerous illegal aliens who prey on citizens and protecting children from predators. Bongino highlighted 'Operation Restoring Justice,' which led to the arrest of 764 child predators nationwide, and warned those targeting children. The FBI is also addressing high-profile cases, including the attack on Rep. Steve Scalise and the Jeffrey Epstein case, while countering what Bongino described as false media narratives and defending FBI Director Patel. Bongino assured the public that the FBI is committed to its reforms and encouraged Americans to monitor their progress.</p>

          <p>A Maryland oral surgeon, Dr. James Ryan, is suspected of murdering his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, who was found unresponsive in their home. Harris's mother suspected Ryan from the beginning, citing his controlling behavior and her daughter's declining health. The article details how Sarah's sister, Rachel, compiled evidence from Sarah's laptop, revealing texts between Sarah and Ryan discussing drugs, including ketamine and propofol. Detective Ian Iacoviello, an expert in pharmaceutical investigations, used this evidence to arrest Ryan, who was ultimately convicted of depraved-heart murder for recklessly providing Sarah with the drugs that led to her death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global uncertainties increase, China is looking to diversify its sources of imported food, with Southeast Asian countries becoming key suppliers. Yunnan, a Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a vital role in this regional agricultural cooperation. Yunnan's involvement began decades ago with the "alternative crop cultivation programme," aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology. Overseas agricultural investment and cooperation are seen as effective ways to support China's food security by diversifying its food supply sources, especially as Chinese food consumption patterns shift towards more meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler in Bedfordshire, promotes the health benefits of platonic touch through "cuddle puddles" and one-on-one therapy. Wood believes that touch boosts serotonin and oxytocin levels while lowering cortisol, which can help individuals with nervous system issues, PTSD, or loneliness. While she emphasizes the platonic and nurturing nature of her services, some experts like Sophie Scott stress the importance of relationships in touch therapy, arguing that safety and trust are crucial for positive outcomes. Pep Valerio, a client of Wood's, testifies to the healing power of these sessions, highlighting the safe environment and emotional release they provide.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are finding success in China by focusing on lower-tier cities amidst sluggish consumption and intense price competition.

The article notes that while this shows efforts to defend market share, it's crucial to monitor expansion beyond wealthier cities. Overall, coffee shop growth is concentrated in second and "new first-tier cities," indicating a broader trend of coffee consumption in less globally-connected urban centers.</p>

The affected areas include Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Unlike typical atmospheric rivers that originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., this event is due to a "cutoff low," diverting the jet stream eastward.

This has led to a decrease in Canadian visitors and a shift towards buying Canadian-made goods, impacting businesses like restaurants and duty-free shops. The decline is further compounded by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which previously shut down border crossings for 19 months. Tania Lee, who runs the Sarnia Duty Free, notes that people who live in border towns often cross the boundary multiple times a week, and she fears that this is negatively affecting her family business.</p>

Minor-key songs signal emotional depth, but Remember Monday attempts to buck the trend with a major-key song. A surprise twist is important to make a song stick in the mind. Acts should be aware of source sensitivity – our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. The success of Conchita Wurst demonstrates that quirkiness and embracing the LGBT community can resonate with Eurovision fans.</p>

Vance and Rubio contacted Prime Minister Modi and General Munir respectively, urging de-escalation, leading to a cease-fire brokered with American involvement.
