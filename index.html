        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his center-left Labor Party have secured a second term, overcoming earlier poll deficits attributed to a cost-of-living crisis. The victory is seen as a rejection of conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, who aligned himself with some of Donald Trump's policies. In his victory speech, Albanese emphasized Australia's independent approach to global challenges, highlighting a desire to avoid simply copying other nations. Voters expressed concerns about the rising cost of living and a lack of bold ideas from either party to address fundamental issues, especially Australia's reliance on the US for defense and China for trade.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old woman in Thessaloniki, Greece, died after a bomb she was allegedly carrying detonated prematurely. According to police reports, the woman intended to place the explosive device outside a bank's ATM around 5 a.m. local time, but something went wrong, causing it to explode in her hands. The blast caused damage to nearby storefronts and vehicles, and authorities are investigating potential links to extreme leftist groups, given Greece's history of politically motivated violence. The woman had a criminal record involving drugs and prostitution, and the incident is being investigated by the organized crime division of the Greek police.</p>

          <p>In a local election in Burnley, England, two pro-Gaza candidates, Maheen Kamran and Azhar Ali, won seats previously held by the Labour Party, signaling a potential shift in local politics. Ali, a former Labour member, faced accusations of antisemitism after claiming Israel allowed Hamas's October 7 attack as a pretext to invade Gaza, for which he later apologized. Kamran has supported gender segregation in public spaces for Muslim women, stating they are uncomfortable mixing with Muslim men. Both candidates cited the situation in Gaza as a primary motivation for entering politics, reflecting growing tensions and divisions within mainstream parties.</p>

The insurance-underwriting profit plummeted by 48.6%, and Berkshire suffered losses due to the dollar's decline in value against other currencies, highlighting the challenges faced by the conglomerate in the current economic environment.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil rights groups, led by the African American Policy Forum (AAPF), has launched a week-long campaign to protest Donald Trump's attacks on Black history and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The campaign, called Freedom to Learn, includes educational sessions, demonstrations, and a Black history challenge to counter Trump's executive orders targeting institutions like the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). The initiative aims to emphasize that Black history is integral to American history and to resist efforts to erase or marginalize difficult chapters of the nation's past. The groups are concerned about Trump's broader efforts to eliminate DEI efforts at all levels of government.</p>

          <p>The recent death by suicide of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has reignited conspiracy theories, but the real tragedy lies in the lack of accountability for Epstein's vast sex trafficking ring and the systemic failures that protect powerful predators. The fact that three Epstein survivors have died by overdose or suicide is enraging and tragic, but it is not a conspiracy, as childhood sexual abuse is associated with a wide range of physical and mental health conditions, including substance abuse. While Ghislaine Maxwell is imprisoned, most of those who enabled Epstein have faced no real consequences, highlighting society's attitudes toward women and the protection of powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has become the first Australian prime minister in 21 years to win a second consecutive three-year term. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging that his party did not perform well enough during the campaign. Energy policy and inflation were major issues, with both sides agreeing that the country faces a cost of living crisis. Albanese's Labor Party has been critical of Dutton's ties to Trump and his proposed policies, which they argue would slash services to pay for nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>A valuation metric favored by Warren Buffett, comparing the total value of publicly traded US companies to the country's gross domestic product, suggests that US equities may be trading at relatively attractive levels. Known as the "Buffett Indicator," the ratio is currently around 180%, similar to levels seen after last year's rapid unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade. The indicator's recent dip comes as the S&P 500 has rebounded 12% from April lows.

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel the New Jersey state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used to send ransom notes in the 93-year-old Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. Researchers believe saliva on the stamps and glue could help determine if Bruno Hauptmann, who was convicted of the crime, acted alone or with co-conspirators. Despite Hauptmann's conviction, lingering questions and conspiracy theories persist about the involvement of others in the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh Jr. The state police have cited concerns about damage to the artifacts, but researchers argue that modern DNA testing methods are non-destructive and could provide valuable insights.</p>

The tariffs, which can reach 145%, are impacting a wide range of consumer goods, including the bridal gown and special occasion apparel business, where an estimated 90% of wedding dresses are made in China. The industry is pushing for carveouts from the duties, as the tariffs have already caused prices to increase between 5% and 25% for some shops. Major bridal brands are adding tariff surcharges, while some are speeding up efforts to move manufacturing out of China.</p>

The unpredictability and indefinite nature of Trump's trade war have shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making, leading to an atrophying of the logistics system. As a result, the nationwide trucking industry is slowing down, and small businesses will falter, highlighting the real-world consequences of trade policies.</p>

Studies show that elderspeak is common in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care and other negative behaviors. The CHAT program has proven successful in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors, as well as potentially lowering the use of antipsychotic drugs.
