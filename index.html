          <p>Boeing has shown signs of a financial turnaround, significantly cutting its quarterly losses to $176 million and boosting revenue by 35% to $22.75 billion. The aerospace company delivered 150 airplanes in the second quarter, its highest number since 2018, leading CEO Kelly Ortberg to declare 2025 as a potential "turnaround year." Despite the improvements in commercial airplane sales and reduced cash burn, the company still faces challenges, including delays in certifying its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models and potential labor strikes in its defense unit.</p>

          <p>A gunman, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. According to Mayor Eric Adams, a note found on the shooter indicated he believed he suffered from CTE, a brain injury associated with contact sports, and blamed the NFL for his condition. The investigation revealed Tamura drove from Las Vegas and mistakenly took an elevator to a different company's office, where the attack occurred. An NFL employee was also seriously wounded in the incident.</p>

          <p>Gold remains a significant commodity, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, particularly during economic uncertainty. As of late July 2025, the price of gold was reported at over $3,300 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuation. The article explains that numerous factors influence its price, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Central bank policies and currency movements, especially the strength of the U.S. dollar, also play a crucial role in determining the value of the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gee-Kung Chang, a distinguished Georgia Institute of Technology professor and a pioneer in 6G network technology, has been fully cleared of all charges after a grueling four-year legal fight. In March 2021, Chang was arrested by federal agents as part of the U.S. government's China Initiative, facing accusations of wire and visa fraud that shattered his reputation. After years of legal proceedings, a judge dismissed the wire fraud charges for lack of evidence in 2024, and the final visa fraud charge was dropped in April of this year, completely exonerating the 74-year-old scientist.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced the opening of a new manufacturing academy in Detroit, a move that comes amid increasing pressure from President Donald Trump to expand the company's U.S. operations. The program, administered by Michigan State University, will offer workshops on manufacturing and artificial intelligence to small and medium-sized businesses starting in August. This initiative is part of Apple's broader public commitment to invest over $500 billion in the U.S., which also includes assembling AI servers in Texas and purchasing chips from an Arizona-based factory. The move is seen as an effort to appease the administration's demands for more domestic production.</p>

          <p>Despite warnings that President Trump's tariffs on imports would lead to significant price increases, American shoppers have yet to experience the full impact for several key reasons. Many companies anticipated the tariffs and stockpiled goods in advance, creating a buffer against immediate cost hikes. Additionally, the steepest proposed tariffs have been repeatedly delayed, giving importers more time to adjust. In many cases, retailers and manufacturers have chosen to absorb the initial tariff costs, eating into their profit margins rather than passing the full expense on to inflation-weary consumers, though this may not be sustainable long-term.</p>

          <p>A tragic boating accident in Miami's Biscayne Bay resulted in the deaths of two children, a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old, with two others remaining in critical condition.

Emergency responders from multiple agencies were involved in the rescue operation. The incident is currently under investigation, and the Miami Yacht Club, which runs the camp, is cooperating with authorities to understand the full circumstances of the crash.</p>

          <p>According to a commentary by Sidney Blumenthal, President Donald Trump's handling of questions regarding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has been a case study in failed damage control. The article argues that Trump's shifting explanations, prevarications, and projections have only intensified scrutiny on the matter, creating chaos within his administration and pitting allies against each other. From blaming political opponents for a "hoax" to dispatching the deputy attorney general to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, his actions are described as those of a suspect under interrogation, constantly drawing attention to the very subject he wishes to suppress.</p>

The restoration project showcases the aircraft's luxurious 1950s interior and highlights the design flaws, such as its rectangular windows, that contributed to the fatal crashes.
