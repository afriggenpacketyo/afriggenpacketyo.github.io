          <p>An Air India plane crash involving a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner has raised concerns about the aircraft's safety record and Boeing's recent troubles. The incident, which occurred in Ahmedabad, India, involved a flight carrying 242 passengers and crew.

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in two decades. The resolution, supported by 19 of the IAEA's 35-member board, cites Iran's failure to fully address questions about undeclared nuclear material and activities. The IAEA also expressed concerns regarding Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, which is nearing weapons-grade levels. In response, Iran has condemned the resolution as politically motivated and announced plans to open a new enrichment facility, further escalating tensions. </p>

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a revival in the United States after decades of decline, driven by increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S. imports over 95% of its uranium despite being the world's largest producer of nuclear power. The Biden administration has banned Russian uranium imports and allocated $2.7 billion to expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity. Experts suggest that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still rely on foreign sources due to limited reserves. </p>

The officers argue that the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause, particularly given President Trump's downplaying of the attack.

          <p>India's consumer price index eased to 2.82% in May, surprising economists and reaching its lowest level since February 2019. The decline was primarily driven by a significant drop in food inflation, particularly in vegetable prices. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy in response to these easing inflationary pressures. Economists anticipate further interest rate cuts, citing softened commodity prices and increased availability of Chinese goods. </p>
