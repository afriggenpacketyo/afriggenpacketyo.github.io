          <h2>German Politicians React to Calls for AfD Ban After Extremist Classification</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 05:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the classification of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a right-wing extremist organization by Germany's domestic spy agency, politicians have cautioned against banning the party. Christian DÃ¼rr from the FDP argued that banning the second-strongest party would be a mistake, advocating instead for political solutions to diminish the AfD's influence. Alexander Throm from the CDU/CSU emphasized the need for the coalition to achieve visible successes in migration, security, and the economy to combat the AfD. Felor Badenberg, Berlin's justice senator, deemed the ban debate premature, anticipating legal challenges from the AfD against its classification. This article underscores the complex political landscape in Germany regarding the AfD's rise and the debate over how to address its extremist views.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease. Participants with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) experienced significant improvements after receiving semaglutide, traditionally a treatment for type 2 diabetes. The study found that 62.9% of participants had less inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers compared to 34.3% in the placebo group. The researchers are planning to gather data for up to five years to determine semaglutide's impact on long-term liver complications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses the rise of "foreign agent" laws in countries like Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Venezuela, Turkey, and Paraguay, which require organizations receiving foreign funding to register with the government. These laws, often vaguely worded, are used to penalize and stigmatize journalists and NGOs, hindering their work. Russia's "foreign agent" law serves as a prime example, forcing independent media outlets into exile and limiting their ability to counter state propaganda. The article warns that even democracies are considering similar legislation, emphasizing the need for carefully defined details to prevent the suppression of dissent.</p>

          <p>The article examines the decline of Catholicism in Latin America and the rise of evangelical churches, despite Pope Francis being the first South American pontiff. Factors contributing to this shift include rapid social changes, changing attitudes on social issues, and child sexual abuse scandals. Evangelical churches, with their focus on individual advancement and conservative interpretations of the gospel, appeal to the working and lower middle classes. The Catholic Church has responded with inculturation and charismatic Catholicism, but faces challenges in maintaining relevance in the region.</p>

          <p>Europe is growing concerned about its reliance on US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard, as well as app-based payment systems such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. ECB President Christine Lagarde has expressed alarm, advocating for greater European control over digital payments. The article explores the varying levels of dependency across EU member states and potential alternatives, including a digital euro and the European Payments Initiative's Wero system.

          <p>BBC reporter Nada Tawfik shares her experience of interviewing Prince Harry in Santa Barbara, California, noting his down-to-earth demeanor and willingness to address critical questions about his security arrangements. Despite the court's judgment against him, Prince Harry was eager to share his feelings about his family and his role within the Royal Family. Tawfik felt it was important to ask him why taxpayers should pay for his security, why a change of status wasn't warranted given he wasn't a working royal, and why protection on a case-by-case basis made him feel at greater risk.</p>
