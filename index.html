          <p>The Israeli military's renewed advance into Gaza has significantly hampered the delivery of aid, leading to widespread hunger among the population. Despite the implementation of a new system intended to facilitate relief efforts, it has faced substantial criticism. The current situation underscores the dire humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza, as access to essential resources remains severely restricted due to ongoing military activities and logistical challenges. The lack of consistent aid delivery is exacerbating the already precarious conditions for residents, who are struggling to secure basic necessities amidst the conflict. The situation remains dire as the need for humanitarian assistance grows more urgent. </p>

          <p>Ukraine has launched a large-scale drone attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," deep into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers and being personally supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The attack, which allegedly took over a year and a half to execute, involved smuggling drones into Russia and remotely launching them to hit airfields, including one over 2,500 miles from Ukraine. This operation comes as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site, with Russia launching a barrage of drones and missiles. Amid these escalating attacks, Ukrainian and Russian representatives are set to resume ceasefire talks in Istanbul, focusing on a complete ceasefire and the return of prisoners and abducted children.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has removed a list of ‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù states, cities, and counties from its website following criticism from the National Sheriffs‚Äô Association. Sheriff Kieran Donahue, president of the association, stated that the list was created without input from sheriffs and violated the principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with law enforcement. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledged that some cities questioned the sanctuary label, asserting that they were giving sanctuary to criminals despite not having specific laws on the books. Immigrant advocates argue that sanctuary policies help build trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement, encouraging residents to report crimes, thus enhancing public safety.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, concluding his four-month tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), expressed reservations about fully endorsing the Trump administration's policies. While affirming his role as a strong ally, Musk acknowledged feeling conflicted, stating he doesn't want to be held responsible for everything the administration does. He voiced disappointment over the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, fearing it undermines DOGE's efforts to cut federal jobs and reduce the U.S. debt. Musk's comments reflect a nuanced stance on his involvement in government, balancing support for the administration with concerns over specific policy decisions.</p>

Coach Greg Vanney expressed pride in his team's resilience, noting that they had maintained their commitment throughout the challenging season. Although this victory offers a respite, it may be a temporary reprieve, as Real Salt Lake has also been struggling, having gone six games without a win.</p>

          <p>As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, global leaders are grappling with understanding Vladimir Putin's true objectives in the conflict. Despite President Trump's desire to broker a deal and Putin's stated interest in peace talks, Russia has intensified aerial attacks on Ukraine. To gain insight into Putin's motivations, NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Angela Stent, a Georgetown University professor and Brookings Institution senior fellow. Stent's expertise provides context on Russia's broader geopolitical strategy and Putin's perspective on the conflict, aiming to clarify the complex dynamics driving the ongoing war.</p>

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also doubled its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries.

Earlier, Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total of 308, but sloppy fielding from England allowed the visitors to capitalize.</p>
