          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves was pictured crying during Prime Minister's Questions, an event that reportedly triggered a multi-billion pound sell-off in the markets due to investor fears of her potential replacement. Allies suggest the market reaction proves she is viewed as a safeguard against excessive government borrowing. The cause of her emotional display remains debated, with some sources citing personal pressure and others pointing to internal party disputes over welfare policy U-turns. The news comes alongside coverage of the Princess of Wales's visit to a hospital, where she spoke candidly about her cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership is struggling to gather enough votes to pass President Trump's major domestic policy legislation, facing resistance from both moderate and conservative members. The bill, which passed the Senate by a narrow margin, includes significant spending on border security and defense, extends tax cuts, and reduces healthcare program funding. Holdouts in the House are displeased with changes made by the Senate, prompting a day of intense negotiations and direct appeals from Trump.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his 3,000th career strikeout, a new column argues that Clayton Kershaw has solidified his status as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The case for Kershaw rests on his remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons, contrasting with Koufax's brilliant but shorter five-year peak. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the article points to his superior career stats in wins, ERA, and winning percentage over a much larger sample size. It concludes that Kershaw's consistent professionalism and sustained excellence make him the franchise's most impactful pitcher.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has lifted export restrictions on semiconductor design software to China, as confirmed by leading software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The reversal allows these companies, along with Siemens EDA, to resume providing their products and technology to Chinese customers. These three companies dominate the global electronic design automation (EDA) market, which is crucial for chip manufacturing. The move, which follows a period of required licensing for such exports, is seen as part of a broader, tentative trade truce between the two nations, which have also signaled progress on resuming exchanges of rare earths and other advanced technologies.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw achieved a historic milestone, becoming just the 20th player in Major League Baseball history to record 3,000 career strikeouts. The moment occurred during the sixth inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox, as Kershaw struck out Vinny Capra with an 84-mph slider. The achievement places him in an elite group, as he is only the fourth left-handed pitcher to reach this mark and one of only two in the last century to do so with a single team. The game was paused as Kershaw received a standing ovation and was congratulated by teammates.</p>

          <p>With a slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the possibility of a tie vote on legislation has become more relevant. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure is considered defeated and does not pass. This scenario was highlighted in a recent vote where a few party defections nearly led to a tie, demonstrating how narrow margins can impact legislative outcomes and empower small groups of dissenting members within the majority party.</p>

          <p>Following the verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial, where he was acquitted of the most serious sex trafficking charges, advocates for survivors of sexual assault have expressed deep disappointment. Activists describe the outcome as a "travesty" and a significant setback for the #MeToo movement, fearing it may discourage future victims from coming forward and prosecutors from taking on similar cases against powerful individuals. The article notes that while Combs was convicted on lesser charges, the acquittal on the main counts sends a mixed message. It also places the verdict in the context of other accused artists who have recently mounted successful comebacks.</p>

          <p>Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska has publicly backed President Trump's contentious tax and spending bill, urging fellow Republicans to support it despite some reservations. Bacon acknowledged concerns about Senate-led changes to Medicaid but argued that voting against the bill would effectively mean a significant tax increase for middle-class families. The legislation faces a difficult path in the House, with opposition from both moderates worried about insurance losses and conservatives concerned about the national debt. Despite the internal party division, Bacon emphasized the bill's focus on work requirements and tax relief as crucial benefits for his constituents.</p>

Authorities have closed a main road and issued emergency alerts, urging people in several settlements to move to safety. A large-scale firefighting operation is underway, with over 150 firefighters, specialized teams, and aircraft battling the flames, though steep terrain and dry conditions are making containment extremely difficult.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell resign from his position immediately, escalating his long-standing criticism of the central bank's policies. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate economic growth. The call for resignation came via a social media post, though it is legally and politically unclear if a president has the authority to remove a Fed chair. Powell has previously stated he would not step down if asked and that he is protected by law from being forced out.</p>

          <p>An official inspection has found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. According to the report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, some documents were so censored that only a few words were visible, making it impossible to assess their value. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules and the risk of jeopardizing prosecutions. Since the issue was identified, the police, council, and prosecutors have established a new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted information to prevent future delays.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that using a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. The research found that for women under 55 who still have a uterus, a combination of estrogen and progestin increases the risk. Conversely, for women who have had a hysterectomy and can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce the risk of breast cancer. This research refines understanding from earlier studies and highlights the importance of tailoring hormone therapy based on individual health factors, such as uterine status.</p>

Investigators also used cell phone data and surveillance footage to track his movements.

          <p>A new study from the Pew Research Center reveals a notable shift among Latino voters, with Donald Trump securing 48% of their vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from 36% in 2020. While a narrow majority of 51% still voted for Kamala Harris, the trend indicates a weakening of traditional Democratic support within this key demographic. Political analysts suggest this shift reflects a growing populist sentiment among working-class Latinos, driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with both parties' immigration policies. The findings challenge long-held assumptions and signal an evolving, dynamic political landscape within the nation's second-largest ethnic group.</p>

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that neither the Constitution nor existing immigration law allows for such a unilateral suspension of asylum rights. The executive order, issued on President Trump's first day in office, had been challenged by several immigrant rights groups. The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to give the administration time to appeal the ruling.</p>
