          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense questioning from senators during a fiery Senate Finance Committee hearing regarding his recent changes to U.S. vaccine policies. The hearing featured heated exchanges with senators like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who challenged Kennedy's skepticism of major medical institutions and his claims about conversations with former CDC Director Susan Monarez. Kennedy defended his positions, arguing that pharmaceutical industry influence has corrupted health organizations and that a lack of trust necessitated his sweeping reforms. The session highlighted the deep political and scientific divisions surrounding public health and immunization policies under the new administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the constitutionality of deploying National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues that President Trump's move to place the city's police under federal control and deploy approximately 2,200 troops oversteps presidential authority and harms the district. The White House defended the action as a necessary measure to combat violent crime and protect federal assets. This legal challenge follows a similar, successful injunction in California that blocked the deployment of troops for law enforcement purposes in that state.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly declined to state whether he would dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner if an investigation finds she breached the ministerial code. Rayner is under scrutiny after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a flat purchase, a mistake she attributes to incorrect legal advice regarding her son's trust fund. While Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Starmer of hypocrisy, the Prime Minister insists on waiting for the official report from his standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus. The situation places Starmer in a difficult political position, balancing party loyalty with his commitment to upholding ministerial standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for prominent tech and business leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates, in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden. The event aimed to foster relationships between the administration and the technology sector, though Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a notable absentee, citing a prior commitment. Musk's absence follows a public falling out with the president after a brief stint in the administration. Despite this, Trump recently commented that he believes Musk, a "man of common sense," will eventually realign with the Republican Party, characterizing their disagreement as a minor deviation.</p>

Levy's tenure recently concluded with the club securing a Europa League trophy, its first major silverware in 17 years.

          <p>The states of Rhode Island and Connecticut are suing the Trump administration over its decision to issue a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind project, a major offshore wind farm. The attorneys general for both states argue the move is illegal, reckless, and politically motivated, designed to harm blue states and appease fossil fuel interests. The nearly completed project is expected to power 350,000 homes and has employed over 1,000 union workers, many of whom are now angered by the sudden halt. The lawsuit contends the stop-work order was issued without any legal basis or identified safety threat, citing only vague "concerns."</p>

During a contentious television interview, Pulte stated that disclosing his sources would be reckless, despite suggestions that doing so could dispel perceptions of political weaponization against Cook, whom President Trump has moved to fire. Pulte has aggressively targeted Cook through criminal referrals and social media posts, raising questions about his motivations as the administration seeks to influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies.

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the historical and cultural significance of conjure, a spiritual tradition developed by enslaved people in the United States. The book argues that the figure of the conjure woman has profoundly shaped American life, influencing everything from medicine and cuisine to music genres like the blues. Stewart traces these practices, rooted in West and Central African religions, through centuries of American history, highlighting the often-overlooked contributions of Black women. Amid a resurgence of interest in conjure in popular culture, the book makes a case for recognizing these traditions as a form of power and resilience.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic accident in Lisbon, Portugal, has resulted in the deaths of 16 people after the historic Elevador da Gloria funicular derailed and crashed into a building. The streetcar, a popular tourist attraction for over a century, was carrying numerous passengers, including foreign visitors, when it careened down a steep hill. An additional 21 people were injured in the incident, which has prompted a national day of mourning and immediate safety inspections of the city's other funiculars. While the official investigation is ongoing, early speculation from engineering experts suggests that a sudden rupture of the main cable may have caused the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK government is considering the implementation of a digital ID system as a tool to address illegal immigration and employment. He suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for unauthorized entry into the country. Acknowledging past privacy concerns that led to the scrapping of a physical ID card scheme over a decade ago, Starmer stated that public perception has likely evolved with the widespread use of digital identification in daily life. Officials are reportedly studying Estonia's extensive digital ID system as a potential model.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 12:20:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to 6.5%, marking its lowest level since October of the previous year. This continued decline in borrowing costs, reported by Freddie Mac, provides increased purchasing power for prospective homebuyers. The trend is largely attributed to growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its decisions significantly influence the bond market, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is facing intense political scrutiny over her personal tax affairs after admitting she underpaid stamp duty on a flat purchase in Hove. The controversy centers on whether she should have paid a higher tax rate reserved for additional properties, a situation complicated by a trust fund established for her disabled son. After initial denials, Rayner commissioned a legal review and has now referred herself to the Prime Minister's ethics adviser. The timeline of events shows growing pressure from Conservative opponents, who are calling for her resignation, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly supported her.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis argues that the widely cited figure of two million U.S. farms is misleading and provides political cover for large-scale agricultural polluters. According to the article, at least a quarter of these designated "farms" generate no sales and are often hobby farms or properties classified as agricultural for tax benefits, not commercial food production. This inflated number is used by lobbyists to argue against environmental regulations by claiming they would burden a vast number of small farmers. A more accurate count of commercial farms would be significantly lower, potentially changing the dynamics of agricultural policy debates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will withdraw a Biden-era proposal that would have required airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays and cancellations caused by the carriers. The planned rule, which faced strong opposition from U.S. airlines, suggested payments ranging from $200 to $775 for domestic disruptions. The White House stated that dropping the plan is consistent with the current administration's priorities. Unlike regulations in the EU and Canada, U.S. airlines are currently only required to provide refunds for canceled flights, not compensation for delays.</p>

The registration requirement is part of a broader government crackdown on what it describes as the spread of hate, cybercrime, and social disruption by users with fake IDs.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has revealed that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles incurred a cost of nearly $120 million. Newsom criticized the deployment as expensive "political theater," with the funds covering payroll, food, travel, and logistics for the more than 4,200 soldiers sent to the city since June. This financial disclosure comes after a federal judge barred the troops from participating in immigration arrests, a ruling that California is now using to seek an injunction against the continued deployment of the remaining 300 soldiers. The governor called the expense an example of waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing on the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard, this article explores the idea that anxiety, when managed properly, can be a catalyst for personal growth and adventure rather than a purely negative state to be eliminated. While acknowledging the seriousness of clinical anxiety disorders, the author argues that everyday anxiety serves as a protective alarm system. Research suggests that moderate levels of anxiety can enhance performance and lead to "flow" states. The article proposes a two-step approach: first, accepting anxiety as a normal occurrence, and second, reframing the physiological response not as dread, but as excitement for an opportunity or challenge.</p>
