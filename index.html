          <p>Three far-right extremists in the UK, Brogan Stewart, Christopher Ringrose, and Marco Pitzettu, have been convicted of terrorism offenses for planning attacks on targets including a mosque. The trio, who idolized the Nazi regime, amassed over 200 weapons, including machetes, swords, and a 3D-printed semi-automatic firearm. Stewart detailed plans to torture a Muslim leader using an "information extraction kit" in online chats. The group, infiltrated by an undercover officer, was arrested after security services believed an attack was imminent, preventing a potentially devastating act of terror.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The company aims to focus on quality programming and storytelling rather than a high volume of content, as CEO David Zaslav emphasizes the value of the HBO brand. This change comes as WBD seeks to scale back its content volume and prioritize profitability, aiming for over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026. The rebranding reflects a broader industry trend of legacy media companies prioritizing quality over quantity in the competitive streaming landscape.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the potential for an investment boom in Syria following the lifting of US sanctions, a move announced by President Trump. The decision, made despite reported opposition from Israel, has been met with jubilation in Damascus, with ordinary Syrians celebrating in the streets. Lifting sanctions is expected to facilitate the delivery of aid and encourage investment from wealthy neighbors, fostering economic recovery and regional stability. However, challenges remain, including the need for massive investment to rebuild devastated infrastructure and resettle displaced populations, with some analysts estimating that it could take decades for the Syrian economy to recover to even half of its pre-war level.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to weaken limits on some perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water, reversing parts of a rule finalized last year. While the EPA will maintain standards for PFOA and PFOS, two common types of PFAS, it will reconsider limits on three other types, including GenX substances. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the agency aims to uphold nationwide standards while providing flexibility for compliance.

          <p>Researchers are exploring the extraction of valuable metals, including rare earths, from wastewater sources like mining runoff, desalination brine, and fracking water. In Butte, Montana, the Berkeley Pit, filled with billions of gallons of toxic water, is being studied for its potential to yield neodymium and praseodymium, essential for electric vehicles and defense technologies. This method is seen as more economical and environmentally friendly than traditional mining, offering a way to turn liabilities into valuable resources.

          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, after overnight debate in the House Ways and Means Committee. The committee passed its portion of the legislation with a party-line vote, but the issue of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction remains unresolved. The current proposal raises the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, but some lawmakers seek a higher limit. The full House vote is expected soon, though the bill could face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

While fluoride is known to strengthen tooth enamel and reduce cavities, the FDA cites concerns that ingested fluoride may alter the gut microbiome and has been linked to thyroid disorders and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports the move, while dental experts largely disagree, citing decades of data supporting fluoride's safety and effectiveness. The action follows Kennedy's call to end community water fluoridation, raising concerns about access to preventative dental care for low-income children.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of a basic standard of living is widening, with the bottom 60% of U.S. households unable to afford a "minimal quality of life." The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity's Minimal Quality of Life index considers costs beyond basic necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare. From 2001 to 2023, the cost of a basic level of economic security doubled, while median earnings for the bottom 60% fell by 4%. The report suggests traditional economic indicators do not reflect the lived reality of many Americans.</p>

The State Department welcomed 59 Afrikaners under an executive order citing "unjust racial discrimination."
