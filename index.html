          <p>Federal authorities revealed that Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, fire attack on pro-Israel demonstrators, confessed to planning the assault for a year, waiting until his daughter's graduation. Soliman is charged with a hate crime for allegedly attacking the demonstrators with Molotov cocktails while yelling "Free Palestine." The affidavit states that Soliman admitted to wanting to kill all Zionist people. He is being held on a $10 million bail, and prosecutors plan to detain him without bail in the federal case. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terror. </p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles continues as the military services adapt fitness standards. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and a graduate of Ranger School, discusses her experiences and the challenges she faced. She argues that gender-neutral standards for combat arms are important but that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. Vanasse refutes claims that standards were lowered for women, emphasizing that she met the same requirements as her male counterparts during Ranger School.</p>

Russia prefers to discuss "lasting peace" on its terms, including Ukrainian military withdrawal from occupied regions and recognition of annexed territories. Despite the lack of progress, Ukraine has handed over a list of children it says were forcefully taken to Russia and is expecting a response to truce proposals by the end of June. </p>

Cramer highlights TJX's ability to maintain low prices amid rising costs for other retailers due to tariffs.

          <p>An inquest found that a housebound disabled woman, Jodey Whiting, took her own life after her benefits were incorrectly stopped, causing her mental health to deteriorate. Whiting, a mother of nine from Stockton-on-Tees, was found dead in 2017, two weeks after being deemed fit to work, a decision precipitated by the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP). The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide due to a "deteriorating mental state" caused by the DWP's decision, as she had lost hope and could not afford her bills. The DWP expressed regret, acknowledging missed opportunities to address Whiting's concerns and is shifting toward a more compassionate approach. </p>

          <p>Mount Etna in Italy erupted, sending a massive ash cloud high into the sky and triggering a red alert for aviation. The volcanic cloud reached an estimated height of 21,325 feet and moved in a west-southwest direction. While the eruption forced officials to halt tourist visits to the volcano, it did not have any immediate impact on people in the area. Aviation alerts were later eased as volcanic activity decreased.</p>
