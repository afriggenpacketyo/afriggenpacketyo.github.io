It discusses the Israeli public's support for the strikes, seeing Iran as a major enemy. However, it also raises concerns about the potential for escalation and the dire lessons of past Israeli military successes leading to complacency. The piece questions whether Netanyahu's actions are driven by genuine security concerns or political motivations.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing various diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, with Â£650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes that gene technology will enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The plan follows a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies.</p>

He emphasized the importance of eliminating individuals who led the weaponization of the nuclear program. Saar affirmed Israel's commitment to doing everything possible to eliminate the threat. The conflict between Israel and Iran escalated a week ago with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, as well as key personnel.

          <p>The Pentagon has rerouted the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group from the Indo-Pacific to the Middle East, marking the fourth such redeployment in less than a year. This move follows escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran.

          <p>In a case involving numerous twists, a judge dismissed all charges against Barry Morphew, without prejudice, just before his trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to finding Suzanne's body. Morphew's defense attorney maintained his innocence and criticized the prosecution for manufacturing a murder case. Suzanne Morphew was officially declared dead in 2024 and was found in 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard University after a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking the school's ability to enroll international students. The Department of Homeland Security had previously revoked Harvard's student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism. Trump suggested that Harvard should cap its foreign student enrollment and share more information with the government. The battle over international students could have significant consequences for Harvard, where a large percentage of students come from outside the United States.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who has expressed support for such bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island would join 10 other states with similar prohibitions. Critics argue that the bill does little to curb mass shootings and only punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates describe the proposed ban as the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>
