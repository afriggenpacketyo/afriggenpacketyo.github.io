        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent surge in electric vehicle sales, the U.S. is falling behind global competitors like China and Europe in EV adoption. Analysts attribute a recent sales boom to a government subsidy that has now expired, with carmakers like Ford and GM anticipating a significant drop in demand. Factors slowing U.S. adoption include comparatively weak government support, higher average vehicle prices, and the effective exclusion of low-cost Chinese brands due to tariffs. The expiration of tax credits and the introduction of new tariffs are expected to create further headwinds for the American EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that police will be given broader powers to place conditions on recurring protests, allowing them to consider the "cumulative impact" of demonstrations. This move, which follows a day with nearly 500 protest-related arrests, could enable police to redirect events if a location has been repeatedly used. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the measures are necessary to balance the right to protest with community safety, particularly for religious groups who feel intimidated. The government will also review existing legislation, including powers to ban protests outright, to ensure consistent application.</p>

          <p>At least nine children have died after allegedly consuming a contaminated cough syrup, prompting three states in India to ban the product. The Indian Health Ministry confirmed that samples of Coldrif cough syrup, manufactured by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), a dangerous industrial solvent. The states of Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala have banned its sale, with other regions issuing public alerts. This incident places renewed scrutiny on India's large pharmaceutical industry, which has faced previous WHO warnings over contaminated medicines linked to child deaths in other countries.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted extensive missile and drone attacks across Ukraine overnight, with a primary focus on the western city of Lviv, located near the Polish border. The strikes resulted in at least two fatalities and several injuries in the Lviv region, while also targeting energy infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, causing power outages and one death. In response to the proximity of the attacks, Poland scrambled its fighter jets, along with allied NATO aircraft, to secure its airspace. The escalation follows recent statements from a U.S. official supporting Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>A Black, British pro-Palestinian activist and Cornell doctoral student recounts his experience of being targeted by U.S. authorities after participating in a campus protest. Following the demonstration, he was banned from campus, and fearing action from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he went into hiding and eventually self-deported. His student visa was later terminated, and he was notified that the Department of Homeland Security had accessed his Google data. The article discusses the use of advanced surveillance technology to monitor non-citizen students, raising concerns about civil liberties and the suppression of dissent.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Hillsboro, Oregon, a crucial piece of evidence was accidentally destroyed. Detectives believed the crime occurred inside a maroon minivan used by the suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, who was allegedly stalking the victim. After a frantic search, investigators located the vehicle at a scrap metal company, only to discover it had been crushed just a week before their arrival. The loss of the minivan, considered the primary crime scene, presented a significant challenge for prosecutors in building their case against the accused killer.</p>

          <p>Four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone significant transformation, though its path to success has been gradual. The club has modernized its training facilities, more than doubled its staff, and seen revenues projected to climb past £400 million. On the pitch, the team won its first major domestic trophy in 70 years and has qualified for the Champions League twice, despite a recent dip in form. However, the club's growth is constrained by Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing it from leveraging its owners' full wealth and forcing a more strategic approach.</p>

This move is seen by analysts as a "soft power" evolution, aiming to connect directly with African youth through cultural and tourism promotion.

However, during an early performance with The Commodores, a woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!," which gave him the validation he needed to pursue music. Richie credits that pivotal moment and his time with the band for helping him overcome his shyness and discover his identity as a singer and songwriter.</p>
