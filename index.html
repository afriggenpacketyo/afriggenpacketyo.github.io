          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 16:30:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from restricting Harvard's access to a student visa database. Trump stated that negotiations with Harvard were progressing well and could lead to a historic settlement. The dispute arose after DHS accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism and threatened to revoke its student visa system certification. The legal battles and potential settlement talks highlight the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and universities over issues such as foreign student enrollment and campus policies. The outcome of these negotiations could significantly impact Harvard's international student population and its relationship with the government. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, following his detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations against the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and foreign students. The judge determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or threat to the community, despite arguments from the government citing potential adverse foreign policy consequences. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his release marks a victory for immigrant rights advocates. </p>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary is preparing to ban the Palestine Action group, effectively designating them as a terrorist organization. This decision follows a security review prompted by activists breaking into RAF Brize Norton and spraying military planes with red paint. The group claimed responsibility for the incident, stating it was a response to the government's failure to uphold moral and legal obligations. While some MPs support the ban, Amnesty International UK expressed concern over using counter-terrorism powers against protest groups. </p>

This decision was overshadowed by recent actions from Trump and Republicans to disapprove regulations allowing California to enforce new "zero emissions" car and truck regulations.
