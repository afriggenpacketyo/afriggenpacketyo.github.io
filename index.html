          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a century-old shipwreck off its coast as a nursery to reintroduce rare flat oysters to the North Sea. Scientists deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the vessel's hull, hoping to re-establish reefs that purify water and support broader marine biodiversity. These oyster reefs, once abundant, were decimated by overfishing and disease. The protected status of the shipwreck as cultural heritage prevents fishing, making it an ideal location for this marine restoration effort.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are set to close due to severe fire safety issues, forcing residents to become homeless. Leaseholders report spending years and significant funds on repairs and fees under a series of management companies, while the buildings deteriorated. The situation highlights systemic problems within the UK's leasehold system, where residents bear financial responsibility for structural failures. Despite nearly £1 million spent by tenants and the council on safety measures, the buildings have been deemed too dangerous to inhabit.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a public warning about potential national security threats posed by imported technology. The ministry stated that foreign-made chips, software, and smart devices could contain hidden "back doors" or exploits embedded during their design. These vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to critical systems, and exfiltrate sensitive data. The warning urges citizens to remain vigilant, highlighting that such back doors could be used to remotely activate cameras and microphones.</p>

          <p>Peaches are being recognized by health experts for their significant benefits, particularly during the summer. Composed of about 89% water, they provide excellent hydration and contain essential electrolytes like potassium, which supports heart health and muscle function. The fruit is also rich in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants such as flavonoids and carotenoids, which can aid digestion, boost immunity, and protect against inflammation. Pairing peaches with protein or healthy fats can help stabilize blood sugar levels due to their natural sugar content.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its efforts to remove climate change information from federal websites and defund related research, a move critics describe as "denial by erasure." Recently, 25 years of National Climate Assessment reports were removed from their official site, and the 400 experts working on the next edition were dismissed. This follows the defunding of climate modeling programs and the cessation of tracking billion-dollar weather disasters. Experts argue that suppressing this data undermines the scientific basis for environmental regulations and makes it harder to address the impacts of a changing climate.</p>

This approach involves imposing or threatening steep duties on trade partners, including allies, to address issues ranging from trade deficits to non-trade matters like immigration. Unlike sanctions, which often require international cooperation and can shut off markets, tariffs provide direct revenue and can be adjusted quickly via executive order.

Scientists have thoroughly debunked these claims, explaining that cloud seeding cannot generate such massive rainfall and its effects are localized.
