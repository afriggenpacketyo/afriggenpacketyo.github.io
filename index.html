          <p>A gunman killed an NYPD officer and three civilians in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year veteran and father of two with a third child on the way. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, used a high-powered rifle in what officials are calling a lone-wolf attack. The motive remains under investigation as authorities trace the suspect's cross-country journey to New York City.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research from Canalys, India has surpassed China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. market. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, largely driven by Apple's strategic shift to expand its manufacturing base in the country. This change reflects a broader trend of supply chain diversification away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines experienced a sharp decline of over 8% after the company reported a 59% drop in its first-quarter net profit. The airline attributed the significant decrease to lower interest income and, notably, losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex and costly restructuring. Analysts noted that Air India's financial drag was deeper than expected and is likely to continue affecting Singapore Airlines' bottom line in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a former head of state in the country has been criminally convicted. The court determined that Uribe conspired to influence testimony from imprisoned former paramilitary members who had accused him of having ties to their groups. The verdict has deeply divided the nation, with supporters viewing him as a hero who fought leftist rebels and critics associating him with severe human rights violations.</p>

          <p>A survey of UK newspaper headlines reveals varied reactions to U.S. President Donald Trump's recent visit and comments. Several papers, including The Guardian and The Daily Mirror, focused on his call for more aid to Gaza and his acknowledgement of "real starvation" there following a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Others, like The Times and The Daily Telegraph, highlighted Trump's political advice to Starmer, urging him to cut taxes and control immigration to counter political rivals. The victorious England women's football team also featured prominently on many front pages.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are facing the potential loss of critical mental health resources due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions of dollars in federal grants. The Department of Education suspended the funding, citing concerns that recipients used it for race-based diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. School officials deny these claims and warn that the cuts will leave students without essential counselors and social workers, particularly in rural areas where private providers are scarce, creating a potential safety issue.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after a video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida gained national attention. Kenny Laynez, who was born and raised in the U.S., was told by an officer, "You got no rights here," during the incident, which occurred as part of an expanded crackdown on illegal immigration. The video also captured an officer suggesting they might end up shooting people who resist. The incident has intensified scrutiny of deputizing local law enforcement for immigration operations, with advocates warning of severe consequences and constitutional violations.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is being viewed by some economists as an "asymmetric and unbalanced deal" that could harm the EU's economy. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while American goods exported to the EU will face no tariffs. In addition, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make $600 billion in investments, leading analysts to suggest the EU accepted unfavorable terms to avoid a more damaging trade war escalation.

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking an injunction to allow him to play this season after the organization denied his waiver for a final year of eligibility. The suit challenges the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive, especially given the disruptions caused by the pandemic and his personal circumstances, including a season-ending injury. Wingfield claims the denial robs him of a significant NIL opportunity and the chance to enhance his career, a critical issue for a USC team needing depth on its offensive line.</p>

However, challenges remain, including the high energy cost of producing new aluminum and its higher price point compared to glass or plastic. Brands must also overcome consumer habits and the loss of features like squeezable or transparent containers that are central to many product identities.</p>
