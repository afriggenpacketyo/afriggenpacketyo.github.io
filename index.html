          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with a marathon session of amendment votes, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's extensive tax and policy proposal, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Republicans are aiming to pass the legislation by a July 4th deadline, while Democrats are using the amendment process to challenge provisions they argue will harm working-class families and benefit the wealthy. The bill, which passed the House by a single vote, faces a contentious path with narrow margins in the Senate and potential opposition in the House to any changes. (not investment advice)</p>

While NOAA insists its remaining data sources are sufficient, the cutoff comes as the agency is already facing resource shortages from recent staff reductions, raising concerns about forecasting capabilities.</p>

          <p>British police have launched a criminal investigation into performances by rap-punk group Bob Vylan and rap trio Kneecap at the Glastonbury festival. The inquiry follows controversial chants led by the bands, including "free, free Palestine" and "death, death to the IDF," which organizers called "appalling." The BBC, which broadcast Bob Vylan's set, condemned the sentiments as "utterly unacceptable." In a related development, the U.S. State Department announced it would revoke the visas of Bob Vylan's members, stating that those who glorify violence are not welcome.</p>

          <p>The White House has claimed that Canada "caved" to pressure from President Donald Trump by withdrawing its planned digital services tax (DST). The reversal came after Trump threatened to terminate all trade negotiations with Ottawa if the tax, which would have impacted U.S. tech companies, was implemented. A top economic aide suggested the U.S. will now push other countries to drop similar taxes as part of future trade talks. Following the concession, negotiations between the U.S. and Canada have reportedly resumed. (not investment advice)</p>

The review notes that the film, directed by Gareth Edwards, feels like a retread of his "Godzilla," with bloodless action, brazen product placement, and a general sense of boredom with its own premise.</p>
