          <p>Tesla refuted a Wall Street Journal report indicating the board was searching for a new CEO to replace Elon Musk, causing initial stock dips that were later recovered. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm dismissed the report as "absolutely false" on X, reaffirming the board's confidence in Musk's leadership and his ability to execute the company's growth plans. The article underscores the sensitivity of Tesla's stock to news regarding its leadership, particularly given Musk's prominent role and public persona.

          <p>A New York Times article reports that the Trump administration's accelerated deportation program has created fear and confusion within the Bhutanese refugee community in the United States, particularly in Pennsylvania. Refugees with criminal records, ranging from DUI to felony assault, are being detained and deported, despite arriving legally through a humanitarian program. These deportees are rendered stateless, as neither Bhutan nor Nepal recognizes them as citizens, leading to a legal and humanitarian crisis. The lack of transparency from immigration officials has amplified anxiety within the community, re-traumatizing many who fled ethnic cleansing in Bhutan and sought refuge in America.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article analyzes the minerals deal signed between the United States and Ukraine, highlighting its potential to bring significant investment for Ukraine's reconstruction post-war.

The deal aims to create a joint investment fund to tap into Ukraine's mineral wealth, although it may take years to yield profits.

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has lost approximately 70% of its lawyers since January, as attorneys have either left, been reassigned, or accepted buyout offers under the Trump administration. This reduction in personnel has compromised the division's ability to enforce federal civil rights laws, with key sections experiencing severe staff reductions. Harmeet Dhillon, who took over the division in April, has prioritized enforcing Trump's agenda, including voter fraud prevention and limiting transgender rights, leading to concerns about the division's future and its capacity to protect civil rights.</p>

          <p>With millions of Americans burdened by credit card debt, experts recommend several steps to avoid defaulting, including contacting the credit card issuer to negotiate payment plans or hardship programs. Consumers should stop using the card to prevent further debt accumulation and create a simple personal budget to track expenses and payment deadlines. Credit counseling and debt consolidation loans can also provide relief, but commitment to repayment and responsible spending habits are crucial for long-term financial stability. Prioritizing debt with the highest interest rates and late fees can help manage overwhelming credit card debt effectively. (not investment advice)</p>
