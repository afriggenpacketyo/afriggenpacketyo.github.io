          <p>Devastating flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have resulted in at least 59 fatalities, including 21 children, according to local officials. Search and rescue operations are still underway for missing individuals, among them campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic on the Guadalupe River. In response to the tragedy, President Donald Trump has signed a Major Disaster Declaration for the county to provide immediate federal resources for first responders. The situation remains critical as authorities continue to search for survivors and identify victims.</p>

          <p>A Eurostar train traveling from Brussels to London was evacuated in northern France after being stranded for nearly four hours due to a power failure. Passengers reported a lack of air conditioning and non-functional toilets before emergency services arrived with water. The rail operator, Eurostar, has apologized for the significant delay, which extended a two-hour journey to over eight hours. Affected customers have been offered a full cash refund and were eventually transferred to a rescue train to complete their journey.</p>

          <p>The dire state of Libya's healthcare system is highlighted by the story of a 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis, whose family undertook a dangerous boat journey to Italy to seek treatment. A viral photo of the exhausted child on a smuggler's boat sparked protests in Tripoli demanding better medical access. Since the 2011 overthrow of Gaddafi, Libya's political instability has crippled its health services, forcing families to seek expensive care abroad or risk their lives migrating. Despite a government promise to cover the child's treatment after the public outcry, the family reports no concrete action has been taken.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was temporarily halted due to a failure in the new electronic line-calling system. The system failed to call a clear "out" ball, leading the chair umpire to order a replay of the point, which frustrated Pavlyuchenkova who felt a game was "stolen" from her. The All England Club attributed the incident to operator error and stated the umpire followed established procedure. This event has intensified scrutiny of the technology, which has faced criticism from several players for its perceived inaccuracy during the tournament.</p>

The article suggests that the PLA will likely establish specialized counter-drone units for rapid response, addressing the inefficiencies of current multi-tasked units. This is viewed as a long-term goal, with more immediate adjustments focusing on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing electronic warfare units.

This new meaning was solidified with the opening of Ellis Island and later championed by President John F. Kennedy, who popularized the phrase "a nation of immigrants." The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, signed at the statue's base, further cemented its role as a beacon for those seeking a new life in America.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Rio de Janeiro, hailing the relationship between the two nations as the "best in history."

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's war in Gaza is causing a collapse of the international system that has governed global politics for nearly 80 years. The author contends that the lack of international resolve to enforce laws of armed conflict and protect civilians has normalized previously unacceptable actions, from bombing hospitals to using starvation as a weapon. This shift, the author claims, has profound implications, leading to the repression of political dissent on U.S. campuses and the bending of U.S. and international laws to accommodate Israeli actions. The piece concludes that the world is ignoring this systemic collapse at its own peril.</p>

          <p>A communication expert and author outlines five common phrases that, despite good intentions, can make a person sound judgmental and erode trust in relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can imply the other person is incompetent or wrong, putting them on the defensive. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" or using "yes, and..." to build on ideas. The key is to be mindful of both the intention and the impact of one's words to foster more positive and respectful communication.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its political and cultural influence in the Western Balkans, using "soft power" tactics such as funding the construction of large mosques. The recently inaugurated Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey's religious authority, is a prime example of this strategy. Analysts note that this religious and cultural outreach is part of a broader geopolitical and economic agenda, which includes Turkish investment in infrastructure like railroads and hotels across the region. This "infrastructure imperialism" is meant to position Turkey as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire, promoting its vision for the future.</p>

          <p>The commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has proposed that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million cost of policing their matches in the UK. He argued for a "polluter pays approach," questioning why event organizers requiring a police presence do not pay for it, which diverts resources from local communities. The suggestion is part of a broader call for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 police forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger ones. This would help forces better manage overstretched funding and modern challenges.</p>

One camp argues that for Bitcoin to be a true "peer-to-peer electronic cash" as intended, it needs widespread adoption for transactions. The other camp contends that Bitcoin has evolved into "digital gold," a store of value where scarcity and limited ownership are features, not bugs. This article explores the identity crisis, comparing Bitcoin to assets like gold and concluding that its value proposition has shifted from a currency to a speculative, scarce asset.

However, this transition faces significant structural hurdles, as indicated by declining imports and persistently high household savings rates. Chinese consumers remain cautious due to an inadequate social safety net and concerns about healthcare, education, and retirement costs. For the consumption-driven model to succeed, it must be supported by substantial structural reforms that increase household confidence and disposable income. (not investment advice)</p>

Uefa rules prevent clubs with the same influential owner from competing in the same tournament, and Textor's company also owns French club Lyon, who also qualified. The decision rests on the outcome of Lyon's appeal against their relegation from Ligue 1; if they fail, they would relinquish their European spot to Palace.

Actions such as ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, imposing tariffs by declaring a national emergency, and taking control of a state's National Guard have challenged the traditional separation of powers. Analysts note that while the expansion of executive authority is not new, Trump's efforts appear to be a deliberate project to eliminate established limits.

          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, aims for broad appeal but ultimately may not resonate beyond its core Christian audience. The review notes that while the film, voiced by A-list actors, has become a box-office success, its approach is often too on-the-nose and lacks the character development and artful storytelling of other successful biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt" or "The Chosen." The film's attempts at humor feel out of place against its otherwise dead-serious tone, making it feel more like a lecture than compelling cinema.</p>

          <p>Some political observers are speculating that the Democratic Party may be facing its own version of the Tea Party movement, which saw a grassroots populist wave reshape the GOP over a decade ago. This potential shift is fueled by a divide between the party establishment and a growing number of progressive, populist-minded candidates and voters. The recent victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral primary is seen as evidence of this trend. The movement is driven by voter anger, a desire for new leadership, and a focus on working-class affordability issues, potentially leading to more primary challenges against moderate incumbents.</p>
