          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal messaging app during a Cabinet meeting a day before President Trump announced his replacement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The photo revealed Waltz had been texting with figures like Vice President JD Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of Signal, stating it's an approved app, however the Pentagon's internal watchdog criticized a former official's use of the Signal app in 2021, calling it a breach of the department's records retention policies. Trump nominated Waltz to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed lawsuits against Hawaii, Michigan, New York, and Vermont, challenging their climate policies, arguing they are unconstitutional and threaten U.S. energy independence. These lawsuits follow President Trumpâ€™s Executive Order 14260, which directs federal action against state laws that burden domestic energy development. The DOJ's complaints target New York and Vermont's "climate superfund" laws, which impose liability on fossil fuel companies for climate change contributions, arguing they are preempted by the Clean Air Act and infringe on federal powers. Separate lawsuits challenge Hawaii and Michigan's litigation against fossil fuel companies, claiming they place unconstitutional burdens on energy producers.</p>

Senior U.S. officials have repeatedly reached out, hoping to begin tariff negotiations, according to a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson. China reiterated its request for the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs as a sign of sincerity, otherwise it would compromise mutual trust.

          <p>President Trump removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations, temporarily replacing him with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources suggest Waltz was ousted due to the Signal situation and concerns about vetting National Security Council staff, though he was given a high-profile new post.

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton provides his perspective on President Trump's second term, characterizing it as incoherent and driven by Trump's desire to be the center of attention. Bolton contrasts Trump's approach with that of a fascist, arguing Trump lacks a coherent philosophy or grand strategy. While acknowledging that Trump has accomplished much in his first 100 days, Bolton questions the follow-up and believes many of Trump's efforts will fail due to institutional checks and balances.</p>

          <p>Fires that have ravaged central Israel have largely been extinguished, though authorities warn they could flare up again due to hot, dry conditions and strong winds. At least 12 people were treated for smoke inhalation, and 17 firefighters were injured, but no fatalities have been reported. Hundreds of people evacuated their homes, but an evacuation order for 12 towns near Jerusalem has now been lifted. Countries including France, Italy and Spain dispatched aircraft to assist in the emergency.</p>

          <p>Amid declining birth rates, more couples are choosing a life without children, with some citing high costs, climate change fears, and career priorities. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that child-free individuals value their relationship with their partner and do not want a third party changing that dynamic. While some may have doubts about the future, the decision to remain child-free is a personal choice made with careful consideration. The Trump administration has proposed a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage child rearing.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Hutchinson, a Gulf War veteran with severe mental problems, was executed in Florida for the 1998 shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children. Hutchinson claimed innocence, alleging a U.S. government conspiracy, but court records showed he argued with his girlfriend before the killings and had gunshot residue on his hands. Hutchinson's defense focused on mental health problems linked to his Army service, but appeals were unsuccessful. The execution was carried out after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal.</p>
