          <p>Following a series of Russian drone incursions into the airspace of Poland and Romania, NATO has initiated a new mission called "Operation Eastern Sentry" to bolster its eastern flank defenses. The operation involves strengthening both ground and air defenses, with allies like the UK, Germany, and France contributing additional aircraft. Experts note the high cost of using traditional jets against inexpensive drones, highlighting the need for investment in more efficient anti-drone technology and a stronger deterrence posture.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely after its host made controversial comments linking the suspect in conservative activist Charlie Kirk's murder to the MAGA movement. The decision followed pressure from the FCC chairman and a preemptive move by Nexstar, a major affiliate station owner, to drop the show. The suspension has ignited a fierce debate over free speech, with President Trump praising the move while Democratic lawmakers and Hollywood unions condemned it as censorship.</p>

          <p>New Zealand is undertaking a massive conservation effort to save unique, flightless birds like the kākāpō and takahē from extinction by eradicating invasive predators by 2050. The ambitious project relies on developing new technologies to make the goal feasible across the country's vast terrain. These innovations include automated traps that use AI to identify target species and genetic research that could potentially create species-specific toxins or prevent predators from breeding, offering a new frontier in wildlife protection.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has adjusted its martial law restrictions, now permitting men between the ages of 18 and 22 to leave and re-enter the country freely. President Zelenskyy stated the policy is intended to keep more young people connected to Ukraine by giving them freedom of movement, without impairing defense capabilities. The change has sparked debate, with some viewing it as a positive step for young people's freedom and others questioning its fairness to those serving in the military.</p>

          <p>The controversial Enhanced Games, an event that will permit athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs, has signed its most high-profile athlete yet: former 100m world champion Fred Kerley. Kerley, who is currently provisionally suspended from traditional athletics, stated his goal is to become the fastest man ever. The organization is now reportedly targeting British athletes, drawing sharp condemnation from official sporting bodies who describe the concept as "grotesque" and a danger to athlete health.</p>

          <p>A shuttered unit at Louisiana's infamous Angola penitentiary, once known as "the dungeon" for its use in solitary confinement, has been reopened to house immigrant detainees under a new ICE initiative. The move, part of the Trump administration's nationwide immigration crackdown, has been criticized by advocates who point to the prison's brutal history and racist past. Officials are using the facility to house what they term the "worst of the worst" detainees, blurring the line between civil immigration detention and criminal incarceration.</p>

          <p>This article details the efforts of Oklahoma's State Superintendent, Ryan Walters, to fundamentally overhaul the state's public school system as part of a broader national conservative movement. Walters has implemented policies such as an ideology test for new teachers, pushed for curriculum changes to include biblical teachings and challenge the 2020 election results, and targeted individual teachers. His actions exemplify a shift in strategy from avoiding public schools to actively remaking them to align with a specific set of conservative and religious values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the spread of the unsubstantiated theory that the suspect in Charlie Kirk's murder was a right-wing extremist, despite evidence pointing to the suspect's left-leaning motivations. The piece suggests that motivated reasoning and the relative rarity of lethal left-wing political violence in modern America contributed to the theory's appeal. It examines historical data on political violence, noting that while it was more common from the left in the 1960s and 70s, it has been predominantly associated with right-wing and jihadist ideologies in recent decades.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of workers across France are participating in a national strike to protest planned government budget cuts, causing significant disruption to public transport, schools, and other services. Major trade unions called for the day of action to demand the reversal of austerity measures proposed to reduce France's high public debt. The protests present a major challenge for the newly appointed prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, whose two immediate predecessors were toppled after proposing similar unpopular budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio's new film, "One Battle After Another," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, explores themes of cultural polarization and extremism. DiCaprio stars as a paranoid ex-revolutionary forced to confront his past, in a story the actor says holds a mirror up to the divisiveness in contemporary society. The film, which also stars Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn, has been in development for 20 years and has been warmly received by critics, who praise its blend of political satire, action, and character-driven humanity.</p>
