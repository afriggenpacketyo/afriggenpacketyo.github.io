          <p>The Global Sumud Flotilla, a large maritime mission carrying humanitarian aid, is attempting to reach the Gaza Strip to draw attention to the severe humanitarian crisis. Comprised of 50 boats and nearly 1,000 activists, including prominent figures, the flotilla aims to challenge Israel's naval blockade, which has been in place since 2007. While the aid itself is symbolic, organizers hope to highlight the ongoing conflict's impact on Palestinians and pressure the international community. Previous attempts since 2010 have been intercepted by Israeli forces, sometimes with deadly consequences, making the success of this mission uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has received a collection of documents from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, including his "birthday book." This book allegedly contains a note from Donald Trump, which Democrats on the committee have since publicly released. Trump has vehemently denied writing the note, calling it fake and filing a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for its prior reporting on the letter. The documents, which also include financial records and flight logs, were subpoenaed by the committee as part of its ongoing investigation into Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>With mortgage interest rates dropping to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased properties during recent peak-rate periods may find refinancing to be a beneficial option. The article suggests evaluating several key factors before proceeding, such as whether current rates are low enough to justify the action and the potential risks of waiting for even lower rates. Homeowners should also calculate closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and consider their long-term plans for the property to ensure the financial benefits outweigh the expenses.

The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has expressed concern over the redundancies and the growing role of AI, stating that morale is being negatively impacted by the continuous job losses.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Police Department is operating with over 2,000 fewer sworn officers than it was budgeted for, a staffing crisis that began during the 2020 "defund the police" movement. This shortage has led to challenges in responding to high-priority 911 calls, even as overall crime rates have trended downward since 2023. President Donald Trump has repeatedly offered to deploy the National Guard to address crime, an idea that Illinois Democratic leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, have firmly rejected, framing it as an unwanted federal militarization of the city.</p>

          <p>A study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that rising temperatures are associated with higher consumption of products containing added sugar among Americans. Using household purchase data, researchers found that consumption, particularly of sweetened beverages and frozen desserts, spiked when temperatures exceeded 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The trend was more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups. The findings suggest a demand for chilled items in warmer weather, raising public health concerns due to the risks associated with excessive sugar intake.</p>

          <p>The family of Andrew Garbor, 38, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center, alleging that a critical delay in his care led to his death from a pulmonary embolism in 2024. A CT scan of his chest, ordered as "STAT" or "right away," was not completed for over 10 hours after he complained of severe chest pains. A subsequent state investigation confirmed the significant delay, noting that such an order should typically be fulfilled within an hour. The lawsuit accuses the hospital of negligence and abuse, claiming the failure to act promptly resulted in his preventable death.</p>

          <p>A strike by London Underground workers, represented by the RMT union, has caused significant travel disruptions for commuters, who have turned to buses, bikes, and other alternatives. The union is demanding better pay and a reduction of the standard work week from 35 to 32 hours, citing the strain on employees and a budget surplus at Transport for London (TfL). TfL has rejected the demand for a shorter work week as "simply unaffordable," stating it would cost hundreds of millions of pounds.

The court found no errors in the lower court's rulings and deemed the damages awarded by the jury to be "fair and reasonable." The panel of judges also dismissed Trump's argument that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity should invalidate the verdict.

The administration had terminated at least 24,000 employees as part of its effort to reduce the size of government.

Despite an impressive record of only four losses in 30 years, the matches against lower-ranked opposition are frequently described as formalities lacking jeopardy or excitement. The analysis notes that while England's possession has increased over the years, shot counts have not, possibly due to opponents deploying deep defensive formations.
