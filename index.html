          <p>Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, a 21-year-old Washington woman accused of fatally shooting a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont. The indictment follows a January traffic stop that escalated into a shootout, resulting in the agent's death and that of Youngblut's companion. Authorities have linked the incident to a cult-like group called the Zizians, which has been connected to multiple deaths across three states. The Justice Department affirmed its commitment to prosecuting attacks on law enforcement officers who are tasked with protecting communities and borders.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows in China's major cities, experts suggest that the nation's smaller, county-level markets could become a significant new driver of consumption. Consumers in these areas often have lighter economic burdens, faster income growth, and greater confidence, making them more willing to spend on a wide range of goods. While first-tier city residents are reducing expenditures, the consumption habits in these lower-tier cities are still evolving, presenting an untapped potential for growth. This shift is crucial for China's goal of transitioning to a consumption-driven economic model, moving away from its reliance on exports and investment.</p>

The company's CEO noted that its business in China is particularly affected by the current environment and assumes no new export licenses will be granted soon. While third-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed estimates, the projected decline in future revenue reflects challenges from capacity adjustments in China and unpredictable demand from key customers, signaling potential headwinds for the sector.

          <p>Comedian Paul Rodriguez, 70, was arrested for a second time in five months in Burbank on suspicion of misdemeanor narcotics possession. The arrest occurred after police conducted a welfare check on Rodriguez and a female companion in a downtown parking structure, where they were reportedly found under the influence. Officers allegedly discovered Xanax and suspected fentanyl in the vehicle, though Rodriguez claimed the drugs were not his. This incident follows a similar arrest in March, after which Rodriguez accused the arresting officer of misconduct and maintained his innocence.</p>

          <p>A new forensic report reveals that Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 University of Idaho murders, made multiple phone calls to his mother shortly after the killings. The analysis by digital forensics firm Cellebrite shows he called her upon returning to his apartment and again when he drove back to the crime scene hours later. The report also highlights that Kohberger turned off his phone during his trips to and from the murders, a move likely intended to hide his location but which served as a significant red flag for investigators. This evidence would have been used to dismantle his alibi had the case gone to trial.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked two Trump administration actions that sought to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities by threatening to withdraw federal funding. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education's guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court decision on admissions, violated procedural requirements. The judge stated the memos created a "sea change" in regulation, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful speech. This ruling is seen as a significant victory for educational institutions and advocates who challenged the policies as an overreach of government authority.</p>

          <p>Despite a rocky consumer rollout, OpenAI's new AI model, GPT-5, is finding significant success in the enterprise sector, where it is seen as a strong competitor to Anthropic's Claude. Companies like Cursor, Vercel, and Box are adopting GPT-5 for its enhanced performance on complex tasks, faster setup, and more competitive pricing. This strategic focus on business applications is supported by OpenAI's growing enterprise sales team, operating independently of its key partner, Microsoft. The push into the enterprise market is critical for OpenAI as it navigates the high operational costs of running advanced AI models.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program commemorates its 90th anniversary, projections indicate its trust funds face a significant shortfall, potentially leading to benefit cuts within the next decade. According to the program's trustees, without legislative changes, Social Security may only be able to pay about 81% of scheduled benefits starting in 2034. In response, bipartisan proposals are emerging in Congress, including one to create a new investment fund and another to increase payroll taxes on higher earners to ensure the program's long-term solvency.

          <p>The Department of Justice and the SEC have charged two men in connection with a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of over $200 million. Ryan Wear, former owner of Water Station Management, is accused of selling non-existent water vending machines and using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier investors. A second man, former fund manager Jordan Chirico, allegedly invested client money into the fraudulent company while concealing his personal financial stake in it. Both men face federal criminal charges, including securities and wire fraud, with potential prison sentences of up to 20 years.</p>

          <p>Financial experts confirm that retirees can own multiple annuities to diversify their retirement income streams and achieve different financial goals. This strategy allows for a balance between guaranteed income from fixed annuities and growth potential from variable or indexed types. However, managing multiple contracts increases complexity, requiring careful coordination of liquidity, fees, and tax implications. Homeowners should stagger surrender periods to maintain access to funds and understand the separate tax treatment of each contract to optimize their financial planning for retirement.

This is a shift from the previous 140 systolic threshold for medication. The guidelines also now recommend forgoing alcohol entirely, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians and their European allies are expressing deep concern over President Trump's upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin, viewing his diplomatic approach as naive and poorly handled. Many in Ukraine feel let down by the U.S., believing Trump has consistently given Russia the benefit of the doubt. Critics point to a lack of Russia expertise within the Trump administration, fearing that any deal reached in Alaska will favor Putin's strategic goals. The primary concern is that a potential agreement could undermine Ukraine's sovereignty rather than securing a genuine and lasting peace for the nation.</p>
