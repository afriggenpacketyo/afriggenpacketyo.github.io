          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting non-citizens under the Alien Enemies Act.  The judge ordered two planes carrying individuals subject to the order to return to the U.S.  The administration argued that the order would cause irreparable harm to the president's authority, while the ACLU contended the deportations would cause irreparable harm to the deportees, who face potential persecution or imprisonment in their destination countries. The judge expressed concern about the deportees being sent to prisons in El Salvador instead of their home country. The lawsuit alleges the administration is illegally invoking the act to target alleged gang members.</p>

          <p>President Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to target members of the Tren de Aragua gang.  A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportation of five Venezuelans. The ACLU and others filed a lawsuit arguing the proclamation could be used to deport any Venezuelan. The White House claims the gang is engaging in mass illegal migration and harming U.S. citizens.  The act allows for deportation without a hearing and has been invoked only a few times before, during wartime.</p>

          <p>President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.  A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking these deportations. The act, rarely used, allows for summary deportation without due process.  The president argued the gang poses a threat to the U.S., while critics say the order is unprecedented and lawless.</p>

          <p>Talks to extend the Gaza ceasefire have failed due to disagreements between Israel and Hamas over key aspects of a US-proposed deal. The US accused Hamas of making "entirely impractical" demands, while Hamas said negotiations broke down.  The deal involves the exchange of hostages and prisoners, and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.  Disagreements remain on the number of hostages to be released and the timing of troop withdrawal.</p>
