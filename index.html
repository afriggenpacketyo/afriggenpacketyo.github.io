          <p>Linda Yaccarino has announced her resignation as CEO of X, the social media company owned by Elon Musk, after a two-year tenure. Her departure follows recent controversies, including an incident where Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, generated antisemitic content. Yaccarino, who was brought in from NBCUniversal to stabilize business operations and advertiser relations, did not state a specific reason for leaving. Throughout her time as CEO, she frequently defended Musk's vision and policies amidst significant changes to the platform's content moderation and safety standards.</p>

          <p>This article examines the ongoing discourse about declining literacy among American youth, differentiating between concerns at the K-12 and college levels. It notes that while every generation worries about the next, recent data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) does show a decline in reading scores for younger students. However, claims about college students' inability to read are more anecdotal, lacking hard comparative data. The piece concludes that while panic may be overstated, there is evidence of real challenges in literacy education that warrant serious attention.</p>

          <p>A man and two young children have died after record-breaking flash floods swept through the village of Ruidoso, New Mexico. The Rio Ruidoso crested at an unprecedented 20 feet, five feet higher than the previous record, overwhelming the community. The flooding was exacerbated by heavy monsoonal rains falling on burn scars from previous wildfires, creating extremely dangerous conditions. Officials have warned that the threat is not over, with more rain forecasted for the area.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced its intention to issue administrative subpoenas to Harvard University for records related to its foreign students. This action represents an escalation in the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and the university over its compliance with the Student Visitor and Exchange Program. The administration accuses Harvard of allowing foreign students to "abuse their visa privileges," while Harvard maintains it is complying with the law. This move is part of a broader pressure campaign that includes threats to the university's accreditation and federal funding.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Hassan Jhangur guilty of murdering Chris Marriott, a 46-year-old man who had stopped to help an injured woman at a wedding reception in Sheffield, UK. Jhangur deliberately drove his car into a crowd of people, killing Marriott and injuring four others, following a family dispute. After the crash, Jhangur also stabbed his new brother-in-law. The victim, Mr. Marriott, was described as a "Good Samaritan" who was unwittingly caught in the middle of the altercation while out for a walk with his family.</p>

          <p>Poland has reinstated border controls with Germany and Lithuania, mirroring Germany's own checks which began in late 2023, disrupting life in border cities like Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice. The move by Poland is a response to Germany's tougher migration policies, including the pushback of asylum seekers. This has created difficulties for commuters and students, and has also seen the emergence of self-proclaimed "citizen patrols" monitoring the border. Local leaders and residents express concern that these political decisions are undermining years of cross-border integration and the principles of the Schengen Agreement.</p>

          <p>The chair of the public inquiry into the UK's infected blood scandal has reported that thousands of victims are being "harmed further" by significant delays in the government's compensation scheme.

Despite a government fund of £11.8 billion, only 460 people have received full compensation so far.

This "fiscal drag" mechanism pulls more people into higher tax brackets as their wages rise.

The comment was in response to Ives's recommendation that Tesla's board of directors should curb Musk's political activities and establish a new pay package with guardrails. Ives's advice came after Musk announced the formation of a new "America Party," a move that coincided with a nearly 7% drop in Tesla's stock.

          <p>A contentious battle over the conservation status of wolves is unfolding across Europe, pitting conservationists against farmers and rural communities. The European Parliament recently voted to downgrade the wolf's "strictly protected" status, a move championed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after her own pony was killed by a wolf. Environmental groups argue this decision is politically motivated, lacks scientific justification, and could undo decades of successful re-population efforts. The conflict highlights the challenge of balancing biodiversity restoration with the economic and social impacts on communities learning to coexist with returning apex predators.</p>

          <p>A major tax and spending law signed by President Trump includes a provision that nearly halves the budget cap for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB, created after the 2008 financial crisis to police consumer harm, will see its funding from the Federal Reserve reduced from a cap of 12% to 6.5% of the Fed's operating expenses. Consumer advocates fear this drastic cut will weaken the agency's ability to supervise large financial firms and enforce consumer protection laws, potentially leaving consumers more vulnerable.
