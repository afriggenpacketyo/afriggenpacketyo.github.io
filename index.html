          <p>The second trial of Karen Read, accused of murdering John O'Keefe, centered on Read's statements during an ambulance ride after O'Keefe was found in the snow. Prosecutors highlighted Read's mention of an argument with her boyfriend as a key piece of evidence, while the defense questioned the context of her statement, suggesting it could refer to an earlier disagreement. Testimony from paramedics and a pathologist provided conflicting details about Read's demeanor and blood alcohol level on the morning O'Keefe died, as jurors visited the crime scene and examined Read's vehicle. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping announced China's plan to leverage its national resources to advance artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and achieve self-reliance. The focus includes overcoming bottlenecks in areas like high-end chips and basic software to establish an independent and controllable AI infrastructure. Despite progress, China recognizes the technological gap with leading nations and aims to strengthen basic research and industrial development in the AI sector.

          <p>Republicans in Congress face a challenge in unifying behind Donald Trump's proposal for a "big, beautiful bill" that includes extending tax cuts, funding border security, and potentially eliminating taxes on tips. The bill's projected increase in the federal deficit is causing divisions within the GOP, with disagreements over proposed cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps. The budget framework passed earlier this month highlights these divisions, as the House and Senate have separate targets for savings and expenditures, creating uncertainty about the bill's final form.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies as US health secretary, particularly his focus on chronic disease and cuts to COVID-19 mitigation efforts, are raising concerns among public health experts. Critics argue that dismantling COVID-19 infrastructure weakens immunization efforts and jeopardizes public health. Actions include clawing back public health funds, delaying vaccine approvals, and appointing individuals critical of COVID-19 policies to key positions. These changes have led to the cancellation of immunization clinics and studies on vaccine safety, potentially impacting efforts to combat infectious diseases and address chronic conditions.</p>

However, rising coffee prices due to climate change and the ongoing conflict in Yemen pose significant challenges to the industry. U.S. policies, including the redesignation of Houthi rebels as a terrorist organization, could further complicate the import of Yemeni coffee, potentially impacting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Students at Occidental College have launched a hunger strike to demand the college divest from weapons manufacturers with ties to Israel and to bolster protections for international students facing visa revocations. Inspired by similar protests, the students aim to draw attention to their demands as the war in Gaza continues. The college has stated that many of the initiatives the students are advocating for are already in place. The hunger strike is a new tactic for students concerned about the plight of Palestinians, following campus restrictions on overnight encampments.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles due to its weakening financial position and a nearly $1 billion budget deficit. The downgrade reflects concerns about the rapid depletion of the city's reserve fund and the potential for further deterioration if budget management is not improved. Lower bond ratings will likely result in higher borrowing costs for the city. Mayor Karen Bass acknowledges the challenges and emphasizes the need for fundamental reforms to address the city's economic situation.</p>

          <p>A Durham University study reveals that chimpanzees exhibit empathetic behaviors, such as comforting each other in distress, as frequently as bonobos, despite commonly being perceived as less empathic. Researchers observed 1,400 hours of chimpanzee and bonobo interactions, noting that both species console each other through embracing, hand-holding, and touching. Younger apes in both species were more likely to offer consolation. The findings challenge previous assumptions about chimpanzee behavior and provide insights into the evolution of human social behavior.</p>
