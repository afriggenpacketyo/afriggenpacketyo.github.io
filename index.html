          <p>A US special envoy stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This potential concession, described as "game-changing," emerged from a summit with President Trump and could provide a path to ending the war without formal NATO membership for Ukraine, a long-standing Russian objection. European and Ukrainian leaders have welcomed the development but are seeking more details on how such an agreement would be implemented and what roles the US and EU would play in practice.</p>

This unified front is seen as an effort to support Zelenskyy and ensure Europe has a voice in any potential peace deal, following a Trump-Putin summit from which the Ukrainian leader was excluded. The move demonstrates Europe's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and aims to prevent a repeat of a previous contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, underscoring the high stakes of the negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early results from Bolivia's presidential election indicate that no candidate will secure an outright majority, setting the stage for the country's first-ever presidential runoff. Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz emerged as the surprise leader, ahead of right-wing former president Jorge Quiroga, while the candidate for the ruling Movement for Socialism (MAS) party performed poorly. This election could mark a significant political shift, ending nearly two decades of dominance by the leftist MAS party, which has been weakened by internal divisions and the disqualification of former president Evo Morales.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a crucial White House meeting, President Trump stated on social media that a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine would require Kyiv to forgo NATO membership. He also asserted there would be "no getting back" of the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, suggesting these conditions are non-negotiable. This declaration comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders prepare to meet with Trump to discuss a path forward after the president's recent summit with Vladimir Putin, setting a contentious tone for the talks.</p>

          <p>In its latest annual report on human rights in the United States, China has accused the U.S. of hypocrisy and using the issue as a political tool. The report criticizes the American political system for being controlled by money, highlights social inequality, widespread racism, and the politicization of immigration. Beijing alleges that Washington has turned human rights into "props for political theatre" and "bargaining chips in power games" to advance its own agenda amid ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington D.C. is set to expand, with West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio committing hundreds of additional troops to the city. The move is part of a federal initiative to address crime, though some crime prevention experts argue it will not solve systemic issues of violence. In response, mayors of several Democratic-led cities have vowed to legally protect their communities from similar federal interventions, anticipating a broader rollout of the controversial policy.</p>

European leaders aim to impress upon Trump that Ukraine's sovereignty must be protected by robust security guarantees, countering any potential concessions made due to his personal rapport with the Russian president.</p>

          <p>The fertility rate in the United States has fallen to a historic low of 1.6 children per woman, well below the 2.1 needed for natural population replacement. This decline is largely attributed to a significant drop in teenage pregnancies and a broader societal shift where women under 30 are having fewer babies, often delaying marriage and childbirth. Demographers are concerned about the long-term economic consequences, such as a smaller workforce to support an aging population and potential strains on institutions like universities and Social Security.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist Croatian singer Thompson has highlighted deep divisions within the country regarding its history and national identity. The event featured the widespread use of the chant "Za dom, spremni," a slogan associated with the World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha regime, which has been condemned by a Croatian court. While supporters, including government officials, view it as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, human rights groups have denounced it as a dangerous embrace of fascism that threatens regional reconciliation.</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its solemn promise to identify every victim of the September 11th attacks, utilizing new forensic technologies to achieve breakthroughs. Advanced methods, such as cryogenic grinding of bone fragments and enhanced DNA amplification, are allowing scientists to successfully identify remains that were previously untestable due to severe degradation. This ongoing effort has provided long-awaited answers to some families, even decades later, though approximately 40% of the victims still remain unidentified.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years and projected to halve by the end of the century. The nation's low birth rate is attributed to factors like a punishing work culture, a stagnant economy, and shifting social norms that have led to record-low marriage rates. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a state-sponsored dating app, while some politicians advocate for revitalizing rural areas to create more family-friendly environments and reverse the trend of urban concentration.</p>
