        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's CATL, the leading EV battery supplier, unveiled its second-generation Shenxing battery, boasting a potential 520 km (323 miles) range boost with only five minutes of charging, potentially surpassing BYD's recent fast-charging tech. This announcement intensifies the competition in the EV battery market, aiming to address consumer concerns about range and charging convenience. CATL's claim, if validated, would position it ahead of Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in charging speed. This development could significantly impact the electric vehicle industry by accelerating the adoption of EVs. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement includes measures to improve compliance with controlled substance dispensing rules and establish a compliance program with the Department of Health and Human Services.

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose statuses were unlawfully revoked. The order grants temporary restraining orders on behalf of the plaintiffs, who claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly terminated their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that ICE's actions are designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and deporting themselves.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge a freeze on over $2.2 billion in federal grants, arguing that the administration's demands to limit campus activism and alter admissions policies infringe upon the university's autonomy.

The lawsuit claims the funding freeze is arbitrary and capricious, violating the Civil Rights Act. The White House responded, asserting that taxpayer funds are a privilege, not a right, and Harvard fails to meet the conditions for access.</p>

          <p>The declining U.S. dollar has created a mixed bag for central banks globally, offering potential relief from dollar-denominated debt but also complicating export competitiveness and posing inflation risks. Many central banks are cautiously considering currency devaluation to maintain economic stability amidst renewed U.S. tariffs and global economic uncertainty. Emerging markets, in particular, face challenges balancing devaluation benefits with the risk of capital flight and higher inflation. Avoiding a currency war remains the preferred course of action, as central banks weigh the impact of devaluation on their local and global economies. (not investment advice)</p>
