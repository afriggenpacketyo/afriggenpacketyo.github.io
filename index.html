          <p>Shedeur Sanders, drafted in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns, faces challenges in the NFL after a precipitous slide in the draft.

          <p>A Massachusetts detective, Brian Fanion, was convicted of murdering his wife, Amy Fanion, after investigators uncovered incriminating internet searches on his work computer. These searches, including inquiries about household poisons, prescription overdoses, and gunshot residue testing, began around the time Fanion was having an affair. The absence of gunshot residue on Amy's wound and inconsistencies in Fanion's statements further fueled suspicion.
