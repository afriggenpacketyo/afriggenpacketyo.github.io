          <p>Shares for retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant 25% jump after the company credited celebrity partnerships for a strong quarterly performance. The firm's ad campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce were cited as key drivers for exceeding sales expectations. Despite some controversy surrounding the Sweeney campaign, which sparked public debate, the company stated the promotions led to increased customer awareness and engagement. This positive momentum has set an optimistic tone for the upcoming fall season.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year. However, the company's stock fell by 4% in extended trading due to a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter. Management cited challenges in selling marketing and commerce products as a reason for the conservative outlook. Despite investments in AI, Salesforce has not experienced the same boom as its tech peers, and its stock has underperformed this year, reflecting investor concerns about its slowing growth trajectory.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliations. The court ruled that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion," rejecting the administration's argument that mass illegal migration constitutes such an event. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy, which has faced numerous challenges over due process concerns. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling as a crucial check on executive power.</p>

Despite the equity gains, concerns remain in the global bond markets, with long-term borrowing costs under pressure.

          <p>Florida is moving to become the first U.S. state to eliminate all vaccine mandates for public school attendance, a move announced by State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. The plan would scrap long-standing requirements for immunizations against diseases like polio, measles, and mumps. The proposal has drawn swift and severe criticism from medical professionals, public health groups, and teachers' unions, who warn it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases and create a public health disaster. This policy starkly contrasts with actions in other states that are reinforcing public health measures.</p>

          <p>Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring held an emotional press conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, calling for the full public release of all investigative files. During the event, several women shared their personal accounts of abuse, and one announced that survivors are compiling a confidential list of Epstein's associates who were allegedly involved. The event was organized by lawmakers pushing for greater transparency, contrasting with President Trump, who dismissed the ongoing calls as a "Democrat hoax" and suggested enough information has already been released.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, a city in China, has introduced a new stimulus measure offering subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan (US$700) for hosting large banquets. The policy is designed to encourage consumer spending in the catering sector as part of a broader effort to boost the local economy amid strained national growth. This initiative reflects the challenge local officials face in promoting consumption while adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance. The city hopes these measures will generate significant additional consumer spending this year.</p>

          <p>A report has found that some members of Gen Z are creating a facade of wealth and luxury travel online, often by going into debt or using clever loopholes. The article details instances where individuals book single nights in expensive rentals or use day passes at exclusive resorts solely for photo opportunities to project an image of a lavish lifestyle. This online persona can sometimes be monetized through brand partnerships, turning the illusion into a source of income.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in federal research funding for Harvard University. The administration had justified the freeze by citing allegations of antisemitism on campus, but Judge Allison D.

The ruling protects over 900 research projects in critical fields like medicine and science, including studies on Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease.

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are challenging the industrial food system by adopting sustainable practices and a direct-to-consumer model. Facing threats from big agriculture and extreme weather, the Mannix family co-founded the Old Salt Co-op, a partnership of ranches committed to regenerative land management. This approach involves rotating cattle to allow land to rest and recover, which improves soil health and increases grass production even in dry years. By processing their meat locally and selling through their own butcher shop and restaurants, they aim to build a resilient, local food system.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, named the 6-5 Fire, has engulfed parts of Chinese Camp, a historic California town settled by Chinese miners during the 1850s Gold Rush. The blaze, caused by lightning, rapidly expanded to over 10 square miles with no containment, forcing evacuations and destroying several homes in the small rural community. The town holds significant historical importance, as it was established by Chinese immigrants who faced persecution and were driven from other mining camps.

The warning came after Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, unveiled a proposal for the annexation of about 80% of the territory.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 268,000 Venezuelan migrants who were granted the protection in 2021. The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program acts as a magnet for illegal immigration and undermines border security efforts. Unless the decision is blocked by courts, those affected will lose their legal status and work permits within 60 days, making them eligible for deportation. Officials have encouraged those who lose their status to self-deport using a government app.</p>

          <h2>Poll Finds Americans Overwhelmingly Describe U.S. Economy as 'Uncertain' Amid Price Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 19:04:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the national economy, with ratings dipping slightly over the past month. When asked to describe the economy, the most common choices were "uncertain" and "struggling," with far more respondents calling it "unfair" than "fair." The primary driver of this sentiment appears to be persistent inflation, as two-thirds of Americans say prices are still rising and expect them to continue to do so. These perceptions are closely linked to how people rate their own personal financial situations.</p>

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on major streaming platforms YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, significantly expanding its audience. The move comes after the nonprofit organization made a public plea for wider distribution to combat financial deficits caused by the decline of traditional cable television subscribers. For decades, C-SPAN has provided unfiltered, gavel-to-gavel coverage of Congress, and these new partnerships are seen as crucial for its future. The deals will provide millions of new subscribers with access to its programming.</p>

          <p>UK ministers have revealed that more than 30,000 homes were fitted with sub-standard insulation under government programs, creating risks of damp and mould. This admission of "systemic failure" is the first official count of homes affected by botched work under the ECO4 and Great British Insulation Scheme since 2022. One homeowner described how faulty insulation led to severe mould that worsened his late father's asthma. The government has promised to ensure all substandard installations are identified and fixed at no cost to the consumer and plans to overhaul its consumer protection system.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking a "victory lap" after fundamentally reshaping the CDC, a process marked by senior staff resignations and the replacement of its vaccine advisory panel. The article critiques Kennedy's recent op-ed, where he praised his own response to a major measles outbreak, asserting that his account downplays the outbreak's severity and his own role in promoting unproven treatments. The author suggests that with fewer senior scientists remaining at the agency, there are fewer checks on Kennedy's anti-vaccine impulses.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell sharply in extended trading following its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. While revenue grew 41% year-over-year to $249.6 million, slightly beating expectations, the company's stock plunged 14%. The company's third-quarter revenue forecast, though representing about 33% growth, did not seem to satisfy investor expectations. Management noted that momentum from new products sold last year is creating a tougher comparison for current growth figures, contributing to the negative market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the potential geopolitical impact of a development bank led by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The author argues that such an institution, bolstered by Chinese loans, could create an alternative financial system for member states, allowing countries like Iran to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions. By developing its own financial instruments, the SCO could reduce its vulnerability to U.S. economic pressure and signal a significant shift in the global financial order. For Iran, integration into this framework is viewed as essential for economic survival.</p>

The court did, however, impose other limits, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with rivals to help restore competition in the market.</p>

The article points to several recent actions, including the granting of military funeral honors for rioter Ashli Babbitt, mass pardons for those convicted of violence, and discussions of a compensation fund for the perpetrators. The author contends that these moves are not about rewriting history but about justifying the actions of the rioters by force, turning perpetrators into victims and heroes.</p>
