          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite expressing fears of persecution and having a pending asylum case. The judge criticized the government for initially claiming the man did not fear deportation, later admitting they couldn't identify who he made that statement to. The man, who is gay, had previously been raped and held captive in Mexico. The judge's order highlights ongoing legal battles over the Trump administration's deportation policies and due process concerns.</p>

          <p>DoorDash data reveals that chicken burgers have surpassed beef burgers in popularity across 17 states in America, driven by the viral fast-food chicken sandwich wars and a consumer shift towards satisfying and affordable alternatives. The trend is also influenced by the perception of chicken as a healthier option, especially among Gen Z and millennials who are heavily influenced by social media trends. Veggie burgers are also gaining traction, becoming the favorite in 13 states, indicating a broader movement towards plant-based eating. This shift reflects changing consumer preferences that consider indulgence, wellness, and sustainability.</p>

This marks his first international festival appearance in 15 years due to a travel ban imposed after protesting the detention of fellow filmmakers. The film was secretly shot and draws inspiration from Panahi's own prison experiences.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a WWI-era submarine lost at sea in 1917 off the coast of California, killing 19 crew members. Using advanced deep-sea imaging technology, the team conducted meticulous surveys of the submarine, which collided with its sister ship during exercises. The images reveal new perspectives of the sub, which was located in 1972 but could not be closely surveyed until now. The team held a remembrance ceremony, ringing a bell 19 times to honor each crew member lost.</p>
