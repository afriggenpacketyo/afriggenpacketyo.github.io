          <p>In the Sean Combs trial, Cassie Ventura admitted to jealousy over Combs' other relationships. The defense questioned Ventura's accounts of witnessing Combs dangle a friend over a balcony and attacking Kerry Morgan, suggesting she learned about these incidents after the fact. Ventura testified that Combs could be "pretty explosive" due to his alleged drug use. The defense attempted to show Combs worried about Ventura's drug use, but she responded he wanted her to stop doing drugs with other people. The cross-examination was disjointed at times, with the defense attorney acknowledging being "all over the place."</p>

          <p>Florida has become the second state to ban the addition of fluoride to drinking water, citing concerns over forced medication. Governor DeSantis signed the bill into law, despite opposition from public health experts and medical professionals who warn of increased tooth decay, especially in children. The law aligns with the positions of Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Florida’s surgeon general Joseph Ladapo, who claim fluoride affects children’s intellectual abilities. The American Dental Association expressed concerns over the long-term harm to vulnerable kids and adults due to the removal of fluoride.</p>

          <p>Mediterranean chain Cava reported better-than-expected sales, with same-store sales growing 10.8%, driven by increased traffic and premium item purchases. CFO Tricia Tolivar noted that diners are shifting from fast food and casual dining to Cava's offerings. This contrasts with rivals like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which reported sales declines. Despite the strong performance, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the year. Cava now anticipates adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $152 million to $159 million, and plans to open between 64 and 68 new locations.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House does not include President Trump's suggestion to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits due to reconciliation process rules. The bill aims to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent but offers seniors an extra $4,000 deduction instead. Eliminating taxes on Social Security could deplete the Social Security trust fund by 2032 and Medicare's by 2030, potentially leading to automatic benefit cuts. While appealing in the short term, experts warn that scrapping these taxes would weaken the program's long-term stability.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has requested approximately 20,000 National Guard troops to assist in the removal of migrants without legal status. Military lawyers are reviewing the request, which would require state governors to volunteer their Guard forces. The role of the Guard troops is yet to be determined, including whether they would provide transportation, security, detain migrants, or make arrests. This request comes after President Trump ordered DHS to increase its deportation force by 20,000 officers, and the administration has been increasing the use of active-duty troops along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a significant drop of over 7% after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported lower-than-expected earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. Despite a 7% year-on-year increase in revenue, the company's net income fell short of analyst expectations, impacted by macroeconomic volatility and the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Alibaba is facing intense competition in China's e-commerce market, with rivals like PDD and JD.com engaging in a price war.

Several justices, including Sonia Sotomayor, expressed skepticism about the legality of Mr. Trump’s proclamation, with Sotomayor stating that it violated four established Supreme Court precedents.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Syria’s foreign minister to discuss lifting U.S. sanctions, following President Trump's announcement that he would end sanctions against Syria. The U.S. goal is to help establish a peaceful, stable Syria, and Rubio expressed encouragement by calls from Syria’s new government for a peaceful relationship with Israel and for expelling terrorists. The Trump administration will begin by issuing a temporary waiver of some sanctions, allowing American dollars to flow into the country and enabling Syria's neighbors to fund reconstruction. The meeting took place in Turkey, and Turkey’s foreign minister and Senator Lindsey Graham also participated.</p>
