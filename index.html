          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina. While tropical storm warnings have been canceled, the system is still expected to bring significant rainfall, with forecasts predicting two to four inches across the Carolinas, potentially causing flash floods. The National Hurricane Center anticipates the system will continue to weaken as it moves northeast into North Carolina. South Carolina's emergency services had previously warned residents about the risks of minor coastal flooding and isolated tornadoes, urging caution on water-covered roads.</p>

Norrie secured the win after a four-hour and 27-minute battle, keeping British interest alive in the men's singles tournament. Despite holding a match point in the third set, Norrie had to regroup after Jarry mounted a strong comeback to force a deciding set. The victory marks a significant moment for Norrie, who is now one win away from matching his 2022 semi-final run at the All England Club.</p>

          <p>A Eurostar train traveling from Brussels to London was evacuated in northern France following a major power failure, leaving passengers stranded for over eight hours. For several hours, those on board were left without air conditioning or functioning toilets until rescue teams arrived with water. Passengers described the situation as frustrating and difficult, especially for children and the elderly. Eurostar has apologized for the incident, which it attributed to a power failure between Lille and Calais, and has offered all affected customers a full refund and additional compensation.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was marred by controversy when the electronic line-calling system failed at a critical moment. The system did not make a call on a long shot from Kartal, forcing the umpire to replay the point, which Pavlyuchenkova argued should have been hers. The Russian player expressed significant frustration, stating a game was "stolen" from her and questioning why the umpire didn't overrule the malfunctioning technology. The All England Club later attributed the incident to operator error but stood by the umpire's decision to replay the point.</p>

          <p>Following Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent advised that the billionaire should focus on his business ventures rather than politics. Bessent commented that while the principles of Musk's former government efficiency department were popular, Musk himself was not, according to polling. The statement came after Musk launched the 'America Party' on social media, citing frustration with government spending and what he termed a 'one-party system'. This move signals a renewed public feud between Musk and his former ally, President Trump, over a major tax and spending bill.</p>

          <p>Following England's 336-run defeat by India in the second Test at Edgbaston, coach Brendon McCullum has admitted they likely made a mistake by choosing to bowl first.

McCullum conceded that they had misjudged how the wicket would play out over the five days.

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which have killed nearly 70 people, highlight the severe limitations of forecasting extreme weather events in an era of climate change. An analysis in this article reveals that the rainfall's intensity, with over 10 inches in three hours, was an exceptionally rare event, difficult to predict with precision. Despite the National Weather Service issuing timely watches and warnings, the actual rainfall totals far exceeded initial forecasts. The disaster underscores the difficulty of pinpointing the exact location and magnitude of such events, a challenge exacerbated by climate warming and underfunding of advanced modeling systems.</p>

          <p>Two years after a car crashed into an end-of-term party at a London school, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls killed say they are still waiting for answers. Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau died in the incident at The Study Preparatory School in Wimbledon in July 2023. At a remembrance event, Nuria's mother expressed frustration over the protracted investigation, stating the families remain committed to uncovering the truth. The driver was initially not charged after claiming an epileptic seizure, but was re-arrested in January after police reviewed the investigation, though no resolution has been reached.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle that culminated in a Supreme Court decision. The men, convicted of various serious crimes, had been held in Djibouti after a lower court judge blocked their deportation, ruling they were entitled to due process hearings. However, the Supreme Court overturned that ruling, allowing the removals to proceed. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national, with the others being from countries that reportedly refused to accept them, highlighting the administration's expansion of deportations to third countries.</p>

The U.S. has set a July 9 deadline for negotiations, after which a 90-day pause on higher tariffs will expire.

The article suggests that the increasing use of unmanned aircraft in recent conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, necessitates the creation of specialized counter-drone units. While this is seen as a long-term goal, the experts propose immediate adjustments, such as integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities into existing electronic warfare units.
