            <h2>Trump's Trade Policy Creates Uncertainty for U.S. Oil Production</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 12:10:54 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's trade war has introduced significant instability into the oil market, causing price fluctuations and undermining investor confidence. The uncertainty stems from Trump's tariff announcements and subsequent pauses, creating hesitancy among U.S. oil producers regarding investment decisions. Lower oil prices, potentially driven by tariffs and reduced demand, could force companies to cut production or reduce returns for shareholders, impacting U.S. energy independence. The situation is further complicated by the potential for increased costs due to steel tariffs, which could raise the price of drilling new wells. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts presented various perspectives, including the potential health and economic impacts of changing the clocks twice a year. While a bill to make daylight saving time permanent passed the Senate in 2022, it did not advance in the House, and Trump's stance on the issue has been inconsistent.

            <p>The House adopted a budget resolution aligned with President Trump's agenda after overcoming resistance from conservative Republicans seeking deeper spending cuts. Republican leaders secured the necessary votes by promising the Senate would pursue at least $1.5 trillion in savings. The budget plan is a crucial step in the reconciliation process, allowing Republicans to pass Trump's priorities, including border security, defense, and tax cuts, with a simple majority in both chambers. However, disagreements remain between the House and Senate over the extent of spending cuts and how to account for previous tax cuts.</p>

Market speculation about China selling U.S. assets further contributed to the bond market's volatility.

            <p>Aggressive immigration enforcement tactics are creating fear among farmworkers, obstructing public health efforts to prevent a bird flu pandemic, according to researchers. Deportation raids and stricter immigration policies have made farmworkers reluctant to seek medical care or participate in bird flu monitoring programs. The fear stems from concerns about deportation and family separation, leading to a potential underreporting of infections and hindering efforts to control the spread of the virus. Public health officials are adapting their outreach strategies to address these concerns, but the chilling effect of immigration policies remains a significant obstacle.</p>

            <p>Inflation eased in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices; however, economists warn that tariffs could reverse this trend. The consumer price index rose 2.4% year-over-year, down from 2.8% in February, while core CPI also declined. Despite the positive signs, concerns remain about rising grocery prices and the potential impact of the Trump administration's trade policies. Economists predict that tariffs could push inflation to around 4% by the end of 2025, significantly above the Federal Reserve's target. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A forensic audio analysis suggests that Israeli troops fired more than 100 times, some from as close as 12 meters, during an attack that killed 15 emergency workers in Gaza. The analysis, commissioned by BBC Verify, contradicts claims made by the Israeli army that troops opened fire "from afar." The Palestinian Red Crescent asserts the workers were deliberately targeted. The Israeli army said it was investigating the attack and repeated claims that six of the people killed were linked to Hamas, without offering evidence.</p>
