        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kamala Harris's recently released memoir, "107 Days," offers a candid account of her presidential campaign, attributing its ultimate failure partly to insufficient time and perceived interference from then-President Joe Biden's staff. She recounts a distracting phone call from Biden shortly before a crucial debate, where he raised rumors about her loyalty, causing her significant distress. The article also reveals her preference for Pete Buttigieg as a running mate and her assessment of Josh Shapiro's "unrealistic expectation" for the Vice President's role. Furthermore, Harris reflects on a damaging gaffe during "The View," where her inability to articulate differences with Biden provided ample ammunition for the opposing campaign, underscoring the intense pressures and missteps of her political journey.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been released from prison and reunited with his family after nearly six years of detention in Egypt. Considered one of the country's most prominent political prisoners, his pardon by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi reportedly followed a request from the National Council for Human Rights, a significant development in his long-standing case. Abdel Fattah was originally arrested in 2019 and sentenced to five years for "spreading false news," specifically for sharing a social media post about a prisoner dying from torture. His family, including his mother who undertook an extensive hunger strike, expressed immense joy at his freedom, though they emphasized that true celebration would come when all political prisoners are released.</p>

          <p>Europe finds itself in a precarious geopolitical position, navigating an increasingly unmoored relationship with the United States while simultaneously struggling to define its stance on China. Historically, Europe's China policy mirrored Washington's, primarily focusing on trade. However, as US-China tensions escalated, Europe adopted a more wary view, labeling China a "systemic rival" and advocating "de-risking." The article highlights that with the transatlantic relationship now less predictable, particularly under a potential Trump administration, Europe faces complex dilemmas regarding trade protectionism, managing green technology dependence on China, and Beijing's practical support for Russia in the Ukraine war. This situation underscores Europe's urgent need to forge an independent and coherent foreign policy strategy.</p>

          <p>China is actively pursuing the creation of a unique foreign relations knowledge system, aiming to explain its foreign policy and global role more effectively to the international community, independent of Western conceptual frameworks. Zheng Yongnian, a dean at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, underscored the strategic importance of this intellectual autonomy as a key component of Beijing's broader push for global influence. This initiative aligns closely with China's recently introduced Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar and inclusive global order emphasizing sovereign equality, shared development, and multilateral cooperation. The article highlights China's ambition to articulate its international relations perspective independently, moving away from Western-centric theories like realism and liberalism.</p>

The German firm is strategically slowing its push for EVs due to weakening demand, intense competition from Chinese rivals, and a general slowdown in the global economy. In a notable shift, Porsche confirmed it would extend production of combustion engine models and launch an upcoming line of sport utility vehicles exclusively with petrol and plug-in hybrid options, despite Europe's impending 2035 ban on new fossil fuel car sales. This article highlights the profound challenges European luxury manufacturers face in the rapidly evolving automotive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old Washington D.C. man, Jacob Samuel Winkler, has been arrested and faces federal charges for allegedly shining a laser pointer at presidential helicopter Marine One, which was carrying President Trump. A U.S. Secret Service patrol officer witnessed Winkler directing a red laser beam at the helicopter after he had previously aimed it at the officer's face. Authorities emphasized that such conduct posed a serious risk of an airborne collision by potentially temporarily blinding or disorienting a pilot. Winkler reportedly told investigators he points lasers at "all kinds of things" and was unaware of the specific prohibition against aiming at Marine One, but later expressed a desire to apologize to President Trump.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller's eulogy for Charlie Kirk is analyzed as a jarring and aggressive declaration of political warfare, serving as a battle cry for the Trump administration's perceived ideological struggle. The article argues that Miller's rhetoric, stripped of Trump's usual idiosyncratic habits, distilled a pure ideology of power, portraying Trump's side as embodying pure good destined to utterly destroy an irredeemably wicked opposition. The piece contrasts Miller's divisive speech, which implicated "multitudes" in Kirk's murder, with Barack Obama's unifying eulogy for Clementa Pinckney. This analysis highlights a significant shift in political discourse, moving from calls for reconciliation to an insistence on the subjugation of one side by the other.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a substantial new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, effective Sunday, dramatically increasing the cost for employers seeking to hire highly skilled foreign professionals. This one-time payment is applicable only to new H-1B applicants, not renewals or current visa holders, with specific exceptions for immigrants whose employment is deemed essential to national interest. The H-1B program is vital for various STEM industries, with tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google heavily relying on these visas to fill specialized roles. This article details the significant policy change, its immediate financial implications for companies, and potential concerns about a "brain drain" of international talent.

          <p>NASA has introduced its latest class of ten astronaut candidates, comprising four men and six women, selected from over 8,000 applicants to begin training for future missions to the International Space Station, the moon, and eventually Mars. This marks NASA's first astronaut class with more women than men, including Anna Menon, a former SpaceX private astronaut. Despite the excitement surrounding these new selections, they join NASA at a time of considerable uncertainty, influenced by Trump administration budget cuts, the planned retirement of the ISS, and ongoing challenges facing the Artemis moon program.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order officially designating Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization," directing administration officials to investigate and thwart its alleged illegal operations and funding. This move, which Trump promised after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, faces significant legal ambiguities as the U.S. currently lacks a statute to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations. Antifa is widely understood as a decentralized movement of left-wing activists rather than a singular, organized group with a clear leadership structure. The article highlights the controversial nature of this executive order, raising concerns about its legal enforceability and potential implications for free speech and political dissent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a significant reduction in federal grants for animal testing, canceling nearly $28 million, as major federal health agencies pivot towards phasing out research on live animals. This shift is driven by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress, aiming to curtail the estimated $20 billion annual federal spending on animal experiments. While animal tests have historically been crucial for developing vaccines and medications, the FDA is now exploring new alternatives like AI-based computational modeling and lab testing on human organs. This article highlights the complex ethical and scientific debate surrounding animal research and its future trajectory in medical advancements.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, affirmed President Donald Trump's power to dismiss a top official on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), thereby allowing him to fire Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. Crucially, the Court also agreed to revisit a nearly century-old legal precedent, known as Humphrey's Executor, which has historically shielded independent agencies from direct presidential interference. Dissenting liberal justices, led by Justice Elena Kagan, warned that this ruling grants the president full control over institutions Congress intended to be bipartisan and independent. This article highlights a significant legal development that expands presidential authority and could profoundly reshape the independence of federal regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>Representative Maxine Waters and a coalition of civil rights activists have formally petitioned the United Nations to investigate federal immigration raids, denouncing them as a form of "ethnic cleansing" and potential human rights violations. The petition, filed partly on behalf of U.S. citizens who allege abuse during these operations, accuses federal agents of engaging in "kidnapping arrests, prolonged detentions without due process of law and the brutal excessive use of force." Activists, including civil rights icon Dolores Huerta, assert that domestic efforts to halt these "roundups" have failed.

          <p>London's City Thameslink station has been identified as Britain's worst major railway station for train cancellations, with approximately one in 13 scheduled stops cancelled over the past year. Across the entire British network, around three million train stops were cancelled out of 89 million, causing widespread stress, inconvenience, and disruption for passengers. The government has expressed its determination to improve standards through a significant overhaul and eventual renationalization of rail services, and some positive signs of progress are reportedly beginning to emerge.
