          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad, requiring firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for existing overseas workers. This policy change is part of a broader effort to reduce net migration, potentially cutting up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers entering the UK. The government also intends to raise the threshold for skilled visas and introduce stricter training requirements to boost domestic employment, though concerns have been raised about the impact on care homes already facing workforce challenges.</p>

This strategy marks a departure from the historical link between economic and political freedom, as the administration expands consumer options through deregulation but curtails individual rights and civil liberties in other spheres. The rise of this new authoritarianism, characterized by a quasi-libertarian focus on consumption, aims to consolidate executive power and limit dissent.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin's offer of direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, without an immediate ceasefire, may be an attempt to exploit divisions between the US and European leaders. The article suggests that Putin's proposal could be a tactic to prolong the war while maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration, seeking sanctions relief and economic benefits. The move is viewed with skepticism by Kyiv, as Putin's actions are seen as an effort to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit.</p>

          <p>While Donald Trump criticizes the US media as fake news, some news organizations have appeared to bend to his will, with billionaire owners seemingly prioritizing access and avoiding conflict over journalistic independence. Examples include settling lawsuits, muzzling critical coverage, and potential interference in reporting, raising concerns about the erosion of a free press. Despite these instances, many journalists have resisted these pressures, continuing to investigate the Trump administration, though the threat of interference remains.</p>
