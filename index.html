          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City during a goodwill visit, causing damage to the ship and injuries to the crew. The incident occurred as the ship was passing under the bridge, resulting in the loss of the top of two masts. At least 22 people were injured, with three in serious condition, and were transported to the hospital. Authorities confirmed that no one fell into the water, and the Brooklyn Bridge did not sustain any structural damage, though the area around the bridge was temporarily closed due to heavy traffic and emergency vehicles.</p>

          <p>A rare clue found at a 1993 Minneapolis murder scene, bloody, bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for answers. Jeanie Childs was found stabbed to death in her apartment, and investigators discovered bloody footprints that didn't belong to her. Years later, DNA evidence from the scene was linked to Jerry Westrom, a businessman and hockey dad. Despite Westrom's denial, his DNA matched evidence from the crime scene, and his footprints were compared to those at the apartment. Westrom was eventually convicted of the murder, bringing closure to a case that had remained unsolved for over 25 years.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, stating that the company should absorb the costs. Trump called on Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS" and keep prices down, arguing that the company made billions of dollars last year. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible, but cautioned that it would not be able to absorb all the pressure imposed by the tariffs. Economists warn that tariffs will inevitably lead to increased prices for consumers. </p>

          <p>Israel launched a major military operation in the Gaza Strip, dubbed "Operation Gideon Chariots," to pressure Hamas to release remaining hostages. The operation follows days of intensive strikes across the territory. Negotiations are underway in Doha, Qatar, to broker a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages. The operation coincides with a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with warnings of famine and dwindling supplies. The UN reports that at least 14,000 children in Gaza are malnourished.</p>

          <p>Two far-right figures, David Clews and Mark Collett, are attempting to influence Reform UK, with plans to "infiltrate" the party and push extremist views. They are encouraging supporters to become active organizers and members of Reform to advance a "pro-white" and anti-immigration agenda. A Reform spokesman stated that the far-right would never be welcome in the party and that a "stringent vetting process" was in place. Clews and Collett aim to shift Reform's platform to include policies such as reducing immigration and deporting individuals.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for its warning that prices could increase due to tariffs, asserting that the company should absorb the costs instead. Trump stated that Walmart should "EAT THE TARIFFS" and not pass the expenses onto consumers. Walmart responded that it has always worked to keep prices low, but acknowledged the reality of small retail margins. The President's comments underscore the tensions between his administration's trade policies and the potential impact on American businesses and consumers.</p>
