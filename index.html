          <p>Top leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and Poland met in Kyiv, urging Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire starting Monday, threatening significant sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not comply. The leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Emmanuel Macron, Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Prime Minister Donald Tusk, coordinated closely with the White House, with President Trump reaffirming his support for the ceasefire after Putin rejected an initial proposal in March. The leaders emphasized the unity in demanding a ceasefire and in the response if the demand is unmet, while the Kremlin dismissed the proposal as contradictory and confrontational, stating that Ukraine's allies must cease sending weapons before any ceasefire can occur. The optimism score reflects the precariousness of the situation despite the unified front.</p>

          <p>After days of escalated conflict, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, initially announced by U.S. President Trump, though India disputed U.S. mediation claims. Despite the agreement, reports of cross-border firing continued in Jammu and Kashmir, with both sides accusing each other of violations. The conflict, triggered by a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, saw retaliatory strikes using drones and missiles. While Pakistanis celebrated the ceasefire, Indian officials accused Pakistan of breaching the agreement, leading to continued tensions and uncertainty in the region.

          <p>President Trump's efforts to advance crypto legislation are facing obstacles due to concerns over his personal cryptocurrency ventures, specifically his meme coin $TRUMP, which has created conflicts of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, intended to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to these ethical issues, with some senators calling it a "pay-for-play scheme." Despite initial bipartisan support, Democrats withdrew their support, citing concerns about anti-money laundering and national security. The situation has frustrated crypto industry leaders, who fear that Trump's personal pursuits are impeding progress on important policy advancements and damaging the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing criticism for potentially being "too late" in responding to economic challenges, as President Trump's tariffs create uncertainty. Despite calls for rate cuts, Powell has maintained a cautious stance, citing a "solid" economy and strong labor market. Economists argue that waiting for confirmation from the labor market may result in a delayed response, potentially leading to a recession. The Fed's reluctance to act preemptively, coupled with the unpredictable impact of tariffs, has placed Powell in a difficult position, with analysts warning of the risk of being behind the curve.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have resumed trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since President Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. Both sides have expressed a desire to break the deadlock, though neither wants to appear as backing down. The tariffs have hurt both economies, with China's factory output declining and the U.S. economy contracting. While Trump insists the tariffs will strengthen America, industries reliant on Chinese goods are concerned about supply chain disruptions and rising consumer costs.</p>

          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, daughter of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was among those arrested at Columbia University during protests against Israel's war in Gaza. The arrest occurred after students occupied part of the Butler library building, renaming it the Basel al-Araj People’s University, and demanding the university divest from businesses involved in Israel's war. University officials called in the police, leading to multiple arrests. The protests and arrests come amid crackdowns on student protests and free speech across US universities.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China concluded the first day of meetings in Geneva, setting up a second day of negotiations that could determine the fate of a global economy impacted by President Trump’s trade war. The meetings are the first since Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent and China retaliated with its own levies of 125 percent on U.S. goods. While expectations for a breakthrough are low, the fact that Beijing and Washington are finally talking has raised hopes that the tension between them could be defused and that the tariffs could ultimately be lowered. The negotiations will be watched closely by economists and investors, who fear that a U.S.-Chinese economic war will lead to slower growth and higher prices around the world.</p>

The cease-fire agreement, which came after four days of missile, drone and artillery strikes, was first announced by President Trump, who cited the role of the United States as a mediator, a claim India disputed. The conflict began after 26 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the Indian side of Kashmir last month, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, a claim Pakistan denies. Despite the cease-fire announcement, cross-border firing was reported in some areas of Jammu and Kashmir, indicating that the agreement was not entirely effective.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. The federal government will fund flights out of the US for undocumented people who choose to leave voluntarily, and provide an "exit bonus," the executive order stated. Trump has called for individuals to self deport, using a government app known as CPB Home. This week, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced $1,000 (£751) bonuses and paid travel for people who leave the US voluntarily.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, on their first joint visit to Ukraine, said on Saturday that Russia would face “new and massive” sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Vladimir V. Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain said the European effort, which calls for a truce to begin on Monday, had been coordinated closely with the White House. White House officials stressed that Mr. Trump has left sanctions on the table repeatedly, including in a recent Truth Social post.</p>

The Teal Wand — "built with empathy," the company said — uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample.

Its return is a reminder of the Cold War competition in space exploration, as well as a time when the Soviet Union was adventurous in space.

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee woke up families and rattled homes as far away as Atlanta as it spread tremors across portions of the southern US on Saturday morning. No injuries or major damage were immediately reported. The website for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake originated shortly after 9am EDT about 12 miles (20km) from Greenback, Tennessee, which is about 30 miles (48km) south of Knoxville. The south-eastern US carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid seismic zone to the west and in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, which is where Saturday’s earthquake occurred, said Davis.</p>
