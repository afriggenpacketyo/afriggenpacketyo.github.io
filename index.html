            <p>President Trump's new tariffs on imports from numerous countries, including a significant 104% levy on Chinese goods, have officially gone into effect, escalating concerns about a potential global trade war. The move has already sent Asian financial markets into a slide, with major indices like the Nikkei 225 experiencing sharp declines. While the White House suggests the tariffs are designed to open negotiations with trading partners, China has vowed to retaliate, raising fears of prolonged economic disruption. The tariffs aim to revive America's manufacturing base, but experts warn of potential inflation and economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>India's central bank (RBI) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, the lowest since September 2022, in response to slowing economic growth and the implementation of reciprocal U.S. tariffs. The RBI acknowledged that the tariffs have increased uncertainty and pose headwinds for global growth and inflation. This decision comes amid softening inflation, with the RBI expressing confidence that inflation will align with its 4% target over the next 12 months. However, HSBC predicts that the tariffs will directly reduce India's full-year growth by 0.5 percentage points. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN agency, is holding critical talks to establish binding regulations aimed at phasing out fossil fuel use in global shipping, which accounts for approximately 3% of global carbon emissions. Discussions include a global marine fuel standard and economic measures like a carbon levy or credit scheme. The implementation of a robust pricing mechanism could be a significant climate deal, but concerns remain due to U.S. tariffs, a potential trade war, and member reluctance towards a levy structure.

Concerns include the impact on manufacturers, farmers, and U.S. households due to higher prices.

While acknowledging the potential effectiveness of Trump's trade strategy, some senators emphasize the need for quick results to justify the economic burden on workers. Lawmakers are also considering legislation to regain congressional oversight of tariff policy, though the White House has signaled a potential veto.</p>

Customized reciprocal tariffs are imposed on approximately 60 "worst offenders," including the European Union, Vietnam, and Japan. China faces escalating tariffs, with a total tariff of 104% on goods imported into the U.S. Canada and Mexico are exempt from the baseline rate, but face measures related to fentanyl and border issues.</p>

            <p>Hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal are diminishing as both countries escalate tariffs and rhetoric, leading analysts to predict a prolonged conflict extending beyond trade to technology and geopolitics. China's decision to reciprocate U.S. tariff increases across the board signals a hardening stance, with state media emphasizing the need to bolster the domestic economy. Experts suggest that a deal is unlikely unless both countries experience significant economic pain, and that U.S.-China competition is a long-term reality. The situation is creating volatility in financial markets and raising questions about China's growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>
