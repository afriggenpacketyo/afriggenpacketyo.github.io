          <p>Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect in a fatal shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been captured following a weeklong search. Authorities allege Brown killed four people in what they described as an unprovoked, "cold blood" attack before fleeing into the nearby mountains. Relatives and community members indicated that the suspect, an Army veteran, had a history of mental health struggles, including PTSD. The capture brought a sense of relief to the community, though it continues to mourn the victims of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A shooting incident near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta resulted in a DeKalb County police officer being critically injured and the suspect's death from a possibly self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suspect reportedly fired multiple rounds at the CDC building, causing property damage but no civilian casualties, though a nearby daycare was occupied. The officer was wounded during an exchange of gunfire when police located the suspect inside a CVS pharmacy. The event prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order on the Emory campus and is now under investigation by state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents stationing themselves at Home Depot locations to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. Volunteers, who describe themselves as regular citizens, aim to protect vulnerable day laborers by providing information and documenting potential raids, which they say have become more frequent. The effort reflects a broader shift in protests against federal immigration policies, moving from large urban rallies to smaller, community-based actions in suburban areas. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network is supporting the campaign by providing training to participants.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are grappling with a significant blow after star offensive tackle Rashawn Slater suffered a season-ending patellar tendon rupture. Coach Jim Harbaugh described the news as a "gut punch," expressing the somber mood within the team while also conveying confidence in Slater's eventual recovery. The injury forces a major reshuffle of the offensive line, with rookie Joe Alt moving to left tackle and Trey Pipkins III stepping into a potential starting role. The team is now looking to free agency to add depth before their upcoming preseason game.</p>

          <p>California's Democratic leadership, including Governor Gavin Newsom, has pledged to counteract a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas by potentially redrawing California's own congressional map. This response comes as Texas Democrats broke quorum by fleeing the state to block a vote that could give the GOP more House seats. The escalating political battle has seen Texas Republicans threaten the absent lawmakers with arrest and financial penalties, while Democrats receive national support for their stand against what they term a "power grab." California leaders stated they are prepared to act if Texas finalizes its plan.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, suggesting a potential deal could involve "some swapping of territories." The announcement comes as a U.S.-imposed deadline for a ceasefire was set to expire, and it follows reports of U.S. and Russian officials working on a deal to freeze the conflict's front lines. While Ukraine's president has been cautiously optimistic about a ceasefire, the Kremlin indicated it is focused on a bilateral meeting with Trump, not a three-way summit including Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University, threatening to take control of patents developed from federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick initiated a review, alleging Harvard has not complied with the Bayh-Dole Act, which requires such inventions to benefit the American public. This action is the latest in a series of retaliatory measures, including freezing research funds over claims of campus antisemitism, which Harvard has challenged in court as an infringement on its academic freedom. The administration is demanding detailed information on all federally funded patents held by the university.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit van, a vehicle that revolutionized commercial transport and became a cultural icon, is marking its 60th anniversary. First launched in 1965, its practical design and versatility made it a favorite not only for tradespeople but also for rock bands and, infamously, as a getaway vehicle for bank robbers. Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey in 2013, Ford's British division continues to lead its design and engineering. As the brand adapts to an electric future, it faces a more competitive market where its historic brand loyalty is being tested.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) reports a notable increase in complaints regarding models in high street fashion ads who appear "unhealthily thin," sparking concerns about a potential return of the "heroin chic" aesthetic. Major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S have recently had advertisements banned, with the watchdog citing that styling, posing, and camera angles made the models appear thinner than they are. While some activists worry about the harmful impact of this trend, fashion experts and the retailers themselves argue that the models are healthy and that the look may be influenced by the resurgence of 90s fashion silhouettes.</p>

          <p>According to the latest CDC data, COVID-19 infections are increasing across the United States, with wastewater surveillance showing the highest activity levels in western states like California, Nevada, and Utah. Nationwide, viral activity in wastewater has risen to a "moderate" level, a metric that often serves as an early indicator of future trends. The rise coincides with the emergence of a new variant, XFG or "Stratus," which has become the third-most common strain. While experts note that seasonal spikes are expected, the developing late-summer wave's potential severity remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The new documentary "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides a rich and honest look at the life of the gifted musician who died tragically in 1997. The film moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist, instead focusing on his complex personality through interviews with his mother, former partners, and bandmates. It explores his creative blossoming in New York, his ambivalent feelings toward fame following the release of his acclaimed album "Grace," and the circumstances of his death, which loved ones maintain was an accident. The documentary is praised for its intimate and dimensional portrayal of Buckley.</p>

          <p>A BBC report explores the darker side of gay hook-up apps like Grindr, with users describing how an initial sense of excitement and validation can devolve into addiction and damaged self-esteem. One user, Lewis, explains how the constant chase for a "dopamine hit" from messages and casual encounters left him feeling objectified and anxious. Musician Jacob Alon echoes these sentiments in his music, writing about feeling empty and degraded after hook-ups arranged on the app. The article highlights a growing conversation about whether the normalization of easily accessible sex has made it harder to form meaningful connections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service just two months after he was sworn into the position. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting commissioner. Long, a former congressman whose term was meant to last until 2027, is expected to be nominated for the post of ambassador to Iceland. His brief tenure occurred during the implementation of new tariffs and tax code changes under the Trump administration. In a social media post, Long confirmed his new appointment and expressed his commitment to serving the president.</p>

As NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon, the piece contrasts the Apollo era's achievements with the current challenges facing space agencies and private companies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City is seen by analysts as a move to appease the hard-right flank of his narrow coalition, essential for his political survival. This policy runs contrary to the positions of both the Israeli security establishment and the majority of the Israeli public, who oppose a long-term occupation and favor a hostage deal to end the war. Critics, including former security chiefs, argue the plan is a strategic trap that serves a messianic minority. President Trump's administration has largely permitted Netanyahu's actions, further tilting the situation toward the far-right's vision for the region.</p>

Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin, has been in power since 1994 and has faced widespread condemnation for suppressing dissent, most notably after a disputed 2020 election. In the interview, he also dismissed rumors that he was grooming his son to be his successor. His rule has been marked by a heavy reliance on Russia, support for the war in Ukraine, and mass arrests of political opponents.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will lower the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel, joining allies like the European Union and the United Kingdom. This coordinated action is intended to further restrict a key source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. Canada's finance minister stated that the move is designed to increase economic pressure on Moscow. The G7's price cap mechanism allows countries to purchase Russian oil using Western shipping and insurance services only if they adhere to the set price limit. (not investment advice)</p>
