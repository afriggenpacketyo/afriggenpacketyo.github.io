          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has engaged with world leaders, seemingly to build support for potential military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of involvement. Modi promised severe punishment for those responsible and the destruction of terror safe havens. The security forces of both countries have exchanged intermittent fire across the border, escalating tensions, while Indian forces have initiated a clampdown in Kashmir, arresting hundreds in their search for the attack's perpetrators. This situation highlights the volatile relationship between the two nations and the potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, despite appearing to be a second-round talent based on his college performance, was drafted much later by the Cleveland Browns, sparking debate and overshadowing other prospects. Reports suggest concerns about his interviews and work ethic contributed to his draft position. Sanders now faces competition from Dillon Gabriel and veterans for the starting quarterback job, requiring significant adjustments to the NFL's complex offensive schemes. Despite playing behind a weak offensive line in college, Sanders showed resilience under pressure, but his success in the NFL will depend on his ability to adapt and integrate into the Browns' system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to federal jobs, hiring freezes, and attacks on DEI programs are destabilizing a path to the middle class for many Black workers. For generations, federal jobs have offered stability and benefits, attracting Black employees. Black people constitute 18.5% of the federal civilian workforce, disproportionately affected by these changes. Experts are concerned that dismantling DEI programs will leave Black workers in a vulnerable position, potentially impacting the Black middle class and limiting opportunities in the private sector.</p>

          <p>A Canadian tech entrepreneur, Josh Adler, is accused of defrauding clients by taking large sums of money for start-up services that were never fully delivered.
