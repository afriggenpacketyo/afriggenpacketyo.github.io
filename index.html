          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, multi-billion dollar compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, structured over the next decade. The plan consists of 12 tranches of shares tied to ambitious market capitalization and operational milestones, such as delivering 20 million vehicles and one million humanoid robots. This proposal follows a Delaware court's decision to void his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018, a ruling the company is currently appealing. The plan would also increase Musk's voting power, a condition he has publicly demanded.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her positions as UK Deputy Prime Minister, Housing Secretary, and deputy Labour leader after an ethics investigation found she breached the ministerial code. The breach relates to the underpayment of tax on a flat she purchased, an error she attributed to not seeking specialist tax advice regarding her complex family arrangements. Her departure has prompted a significant cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and will trigger a new deputy leadership election within the Labour Party, creating political uncertainty for the government.</p>

          <p>British actor John Alford, known for his roles in "London's Burning" and "Grange Hill," has been convicted of sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a friend's house in 2022. The jury found the 53-year-old guilty on multiple counts, including sexual activity with a 14-year-old and sexual assault of a 15-year-old. Prosecutors stated that both victims were intoxicated during the attacks, which Alford had denied, claiming he was the victim of an extortion plot. He is currently awaiting sentencing for the offenses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed a bill raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the year 2025. This reverses a key provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had limited the deduction to $10,000, a move that disproportionately affected taxpayers in high-tax states. Proponents argue the change reduces double taxation, while critics point to the significant cost, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.

          <p>A multi-agency federal operation at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 immigrant workers suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The raid, part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices, involved Homeland Security Investigations, ICE, the FBI, and other agencies, reflecting the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. The majority of those detained were reportedly Korean nationals working for various subcontractors at the facility. The South Korean government has expressed concern, urging the U.S. to ensure the rights of its citizens are not infringed upon.</p>

          <p>This article provides a biographical look at Angela Rayner, whose political career saw a dramatic rise from a working-class background to becoming Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It chronicles her journey from leaving school with no qualifications and becoming a young mother to her ascent through the trade union Unison and eventually to the highest levels of the Labour Party. Her recent, sudden resignation over a tax dispute marks a significant downfall for a politician once considered a powerful and relatable figure in British politics, leaving a major void in the current government.</p>

          <p>The United States is sending ten F-35 fighter jets to the Caribbean as part of an escalating campaign against drug cartels, amid rising tensions with Venezuela. This deployment follows a recent deadly U.S. strike on a boat alleged to be carrying narcotics and traffickers. The move is part of a broader military buildup in the region, which includes the assignment of guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela. The situation was further inflamed when two armed Venezuelan fighter jets flew over a U.S. warship in what was described as a "show of force."</p>

          <p>Following a weak jobs report and with global equities at all-time highs, financial experts advise investors to consider defensive strategies to protect their portfolio gains. Analysts suggest that many portfolios are overly concentrated in a few mega-cap tech stocks, creating significant risk if the market shifts. They recommend re-evaluating holdings and potentially rotating some capital from recent high-flyers into undervalued sectors that have not participated in the recent rally. This repositioning is presented as a prudent measure to insulate against potential market downturns or economic speed bumps. (not investment advice)</p>

While polls show majority support for military service among the general population, younger Germans are more opposed.

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to attend the men's singles final at the US Open tennis tournament in New York on Sunday. This will mark his first visit to the Grand Slam event since 2015, before he was first elected president. A White House official confirmed the planned attendance. The tournament is held in Queens, the New York City borough where Trump was born. The finalists for Sunday's match will be determined by Friday's semifinal contests between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner and Felix Auger-Aliassime.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Senators Urge Smithsonian to Resist White House Political Pressure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four Democratic senators have sent a letter to the Smithsonian Institution, urging its leadership to resist what they describe as attempts by the White House to "bully the institution." The letter follows President Trump's criticism of the Smithsonian for presenting what he called a negative narrative of American history, and a subsequent White House memo targeting specific exhibitions. The senators assert that the Smithsonian is an independent federal trust managed by Congress, not an executive agency, and must remain free from political interference over its historical and artistic content.</p>

          <p>While China showcased its military power in a massive parade, an activist named Qi Hong staged a bold act of defiance by projecting anti-communist slogans onto a high-rise building in Chongqing. The messages, including "Down with the Red Fascists!" and "Overthrow communist tyranny!" were part of a carefully planned protest against the government's authoritarian rule. Such public dissent is extremely rare in China, where criticism of the state is severely punished. Qi, who has since fled the country, stated he was motivated by the government's use of state machinery to incite hatred.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article questions why major news organizations have given little attention to President Donald Trump's apparent health issues and recent brief disappearance from public view. The author contrasts this with the intense, albeit delayed, media coverage of Joe Biden's age and health during the 2024 campaign, suggesting a potential double standard. The article argues that while rampant speculation is unhelpful, the White House's lack of transparency and minimal explanations for the president's bruised hands, uneven gait, and verbal confusion warrant more persistent and evidence-based journalistic inquiry.</p>

          <p>Gun rights organizations like Gun Owners of America are advancing a long-term strategy to dismantle the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA), one of the nation's oldest gun control laws. Their efforts recently achieved a major success when the new budget bill eliminated the $200 tax on items like silencers and short-barreled rifles, though registration requirements remain. Immediately after the bill was signed, these groups filed lawsuits aiming to overturn the remaining NFA restrictions on these items entirely, arguing they are unconstitutional. This push reflects a growing absolutist interpretation of the Second Amendment within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that authoritarian leaders from Russia, China, and North Korea increasingly view U.S. President Donald Trump as an unserious and ineffective leader, diminishing American prestige on the world stage. The author points to Trump's exclusion from a recent military parade in Beijing attended by Putin, Xi, and Kim as a clear snub. The article contends that these leaders have learned they can manage Trump by appealing to his ego while continuing to advance their own strategic interests, such as Russia's war in Ukraine and North Korea's nuclear program, without serious consequence.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. space officials have expressed concern over China's rapidly advancing space capabilities, highlighting a recent high-orbit refueling and docking mission as evidence that Beijing may be outpacing the United States. Two Chinese satellites successfully docked 36,000 km above Earth and performed what a former U.S. Space Command deputy commander called "the largest single maneuver ever conducted in geosynchronous orbit." These developments are raising alarms that China's progress in complex orbital operations could give it a strategic advantage, potentially enabling it to beat the U.S. in returning to the moon.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Snowy Day and Other Stories," the first English-translated collection of fiction by acclaimed South Korean film director Lee Chang-dong. The stories, written early in his career before he turned to filmmaking, are set against the backdrop of South Korea's repressive military dictatorship in the 1980s. The reviewer praises Lee's powerful use of imagery and his ability to evoke the era's pervasive paranoia and political tension without direct explanation. The collection is highlighted for its sophisticated, cinematic prose that communicates complex emotions and the subtle indignities of life under an authoritarian regime.</p>

          <p>Chicago is bracing for the imminent arrival of federal law enforcement and ICE agents, a move championed by President Trump to address crime but strongly opposed by local leaders. Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have rejected the deployment, with Johnson passing an executive order to limit federal influence on local policing. Community organizations are preparing by sharing "Know Your Rights" information and organizing legal support, fearing the federal presence will lead to racial profiling and escalate tensions rather than reduce violence in the city.</p>
