          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a third victory against Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano, winning their final trilogy bout by a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The fight, described as more of a strategic "chess match" than their previous encounters, saw Taylor retain her undisputed light-welterweight championship. While Serrano had moments of success, Taylor's economical and smart boxing, particularly in the later rounds, proved decisive in front of the sold-out arena. Both fighters expressed mutual respect after the historic all-female card, with Taylor acknowledging Serrano as an "amazing warrior."</p>

          <p>A property developer has been engaged in an eight-year legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed over a luxury penthouse in Mayfair, London. The dispute, which began over a lift installation agreement, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the "malicious" use of a noisy lift at night. This conflict highlights Al Fayed's historically combative business approach, which appears to continue after his death. The article also notes the building's connection to past sexual assault allegations against Al Fayed, which were previously reported by the BBC.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs and allowing the Giants to build a significant lead that the Dodgers' powerful offense couldn't overcome. Shohei Ohtani hit his 32nd home run into McCovey's Cove, but it wasn't enough to stop the team's longest losing streak since 2017. The loss narrows the Dodgers' division lead to four games, highlighting the team's recent struggles as they head towards the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>Sedrick T. Stevenson, a fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of a smiling Stevenson on the return flight, where he was under heavy guard by multiple law enforcement agencies to prevent another escape. Stevenson, who was wanted on multiple charges including firearm possession and assault, had been missing for over a month before U.S. Marshals apprehended him in Seattle. Officials noted the extensive coordination required for his secure transport.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Israel's proposed plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah amounts to a crime against humanity, likening it to a concentration camp. The author contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, dating back to the 1948 Nakba, and that this failure has led to a sense of despair. Despite the ineffectiveness of legal institutions and continued Western support for Israel, the author places hope in Palestinian resilience and steadfastness. The article concludes that the world will ultimately judge Israel based on its actions and the human suffering it has caused.</p>

A map provided by Israel showing its proposed buffer zones reportedly contradicted earlier statements, eroding trust and leading Hamas to view the move as a bad-faith maneuver.</p>

Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong stated there was a "mountain of evidence" that constitutional rights were being violated.

          <p>"The Night We Met," a 2015 song by the indie band Lord Huron, has become an unlikely global hit, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify. Initially an album track that flew under the radar, its popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and has since snowballed through its use in viral TikTok videos. The song's slow-burning success is a rare phenomenon for a track that was not a hit upon its release. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes its lasting appeal to its relatable, wistful lyrics that allow listeners to insert their own stories into the song.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Numerous independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been left confused and hurt after the popular plush toy brand Jellycat suddenly terminated their supply agreements. The company sent emails to about 100 stores, stating the decision was part of a "brand elevation strategy" and was not open to negotiation. Many of these small businesses had stocked the brand for decades and relied on it for a significant portion of their income, especially after the toys' recent explosion in popularity on TikTok. The move has sparked a backlash from both retailers and customers, who feel the brand is abandoning the independent shops that helped build its success.</p>

His family plans to take him to a hospital upon his release to assess injuries sustained during the arrest, which they believe include a concussion. Barranco, who has lived in the U.S. for decades and is married to a U.S. citizen, had applied for parole-in-place, a program for military family members.</p>

          <p>A mother in Gaza has described the moment an Israeli airstrike killed two of her young sons and her niece while they were waiting for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic. The attack, which occurred in Deir al-Balah, killed 16 people, including 10 children. Her youngest son, two-year-old Siraj, was critically injured and is not expected to survive. The Israeli military stated it targeted a "Hamas terrorist" and regrets any harm to civilians, but the aid group running the clinic condemned the strike as a blatant violation of international law. The story highlights the daily dangers and severe food shortages faced by civilians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A contentious debate has emerged in Prague over the future of the historic Vysehrad railway bridge, an iconic 123-year-old steel structure. The national Railway Authority plans to dismantle the bridge and replace it with a new, three-track version to handle growing traffic, arguing the original is too corroded to be viable. However, a coalition of architects and preservationists, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, insists the bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. The conflict represents a classic dilemma between modernization and heritage preservation in a city renowned for its architectural history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization plan by the Trump administration.

Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the widespread layoffs will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security.

Species like vital seaweeds and seagrasses struggle to survive, which can have cascading effects on fish stocks and overall biodiversity. The Mediterranean is considered a climate change hotspot, and experts warn that such events are becoming more common and intense due to global warming.</p>
