          <p>An Indiana bankruptcy attorney named Mark S. Zuckerberg is suing Meta, Facebook's parent company, due to repeated account suspensions. Zuckerberg claims his account has been disabled five times in eight years, costing him thousands in lost business. Meta allegedly accused him of not using his "authentic name," despite him providing ample identification. The company has since reinstated his account, acknowledging the error and promising to prevent future occurrences, however Zuckerberg is still suing them for breach of contract due to advertising money lost.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has reached an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history. This article analyzes Powerball data to determine which states offer the highest and lowest after-tax payouts. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to receive a larger sum after federal taxes. Conversely, states with higher income taxes, such as Minnesota, Oregon, New Jersey, Washington D.C., and New York, result in lower net winnings for jackpot recipients. The article also notes that the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>President Trump Plans to Rename Defense Department as Department of War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 22:18:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump intends to sign an executive order renaming the Department of Defense as the Department of War. This change would revert the department to its pre-1949 name, aligning with its historical designation. The order would allow officials to use the title Secretary of War, and a White House fact sheet indicates that the new name will serve as a "secondary title." While the official renaming may require congressional action, Trump believes it's unnecessary, though it is unclear whether he has the authority to do so. The cost of changing signs, seals, and titles across the department could be significant, potentially costing taxpayers millions. </p>

          <p>This article criticizes President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, deeming it an inane move. The author argues that the current name reflects a broader understanding of national security beyond just military force. They highlight that the shift to the Department of Defense in 1949 acknowledged the need for ongoing national defense rather than intermittent engagement in war. The author contrasts Trump's perspective with the views of past presidents and other nations, many of whom use "defense" in their military organizations' names. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is directing that the Department of Defense be known as the Department of War. He will sign an executive order for the defense department to use the new name as a secondary title, and for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to be known as Secretary of War. The Pentagon is the successor to the War Department, which existed until 1947. The executive order states that the name "Department of War" conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve compared to "Department of Defense." </p>

          <p>A Georgia school district is reporting positive outcomes from its student cellphone ban, known as the Disconnect to Reconnect program. The program requires students to keep their phones in their backpacks during the school day. Teachers and administrators at Lakeside High School say the ban has improved the learning environment and student conduct. More than half of U.S. states have laws regulating cellphone use in schools, and Georgia will implement a statewide ban in 2026. </p>
