          <p>Representatives from Ukraine and Russia met in Istanbul for the first time in three years, marking a potential turning point in the ongoing conflict. The talks, however, were met with skepticism, as key leaders like Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump did not attend. While Ukraine seeks an immediate ceasefire and negotiations, Russia is pushing for significant concessions. Despite the uncertainty, the U.S. delegation, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, expressed hope for progress, emphasizing the need for a diplomatic resolution to end the war. The location of Istanbul holds symbolic importance, as it was previously the site of diplomatic efforts and the Black Sea Grain Initiative.</p>

This "Three-Body Computing Constellation," developed by Zhejiang Lab, aims to provide real-time data processing in orbit, potentially rivaling ground-based supercomputers. Experts suggest that such orbital data centers could leverage solar power and space's heat-radiating properties, reducing energy consumption. This launch signifies a crucial step in testing the networking capabilities required for cloud computing in space.</p>

          <p>A report by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) found that over 1,000 students or student groups in the US were targeted by their universities for punishment over their speech between 2020 and 2024. The report paints a picture of institutions of higher learning that are increasingly willing to punish students over the expression of their views. Before the war in Gaza, most of the students facing calls for or actual punishment were targeted for “expression about race”, the report finds, with most demands for discipline coming from other students on the left in response to racist speech. Since 2023, students have been punished over pro-Palestine speech from the right, with politicians and university administrators themselves leading the charge more than in any other period.</p>

          <p>Robert Macfarlane's new book, 'Is a River Alive?', explores the question of whether rivers are living beings with memory and intention. Macfarlane takes readers to three countries, each home to threatened rivers, and considers the relationship between humans and these waterways. The book delves into rights of nature discussions and the idea of shifting our thinking to see rivers as "who" rather than "it." Macfarlane's writing is beautiful and thought-provoking, prompting readers to reconsider their relationship with nature.</p>

          <p>President Trump's endorsement of cryptocurrency has sparked concerns about potential corruption and conflicts of interest. His family's involvement in crypto-related deals, including offering access to Trump for large buyers of a memecoin, has drawn criticism from politicians and crypto promoters alike. Critics argue that these ventures may be a way for foreign nationals to circumvent campaign finance laws. This has led to calls for investigations and proposed legislation to prevent officials from profiting from cryptocurrency endorsements.</p>

          <p>It took the LAPD 23 years to identify one of their own as the culprit in the 1986 murder of Sherri Rasmussen. Stephanie Lazarus, a 25-year-old patrol officer and ex-lover of Rasmussen's husband, was eventually convicted of the crime. The case highlights potential investigative tunnel vision and questions about whether someone inside the LAPD helped Lazarus evade suspicion for so long. This case has been considered to be a prime example of the blue wall of silence.</p>

The resolution requires the district to study the reproductive health and parenting needs of employees and come up with a plan of action by November.
