          <p>The New York Jets have reportedly secured a landmark deal with cornerback Sauce Gardner, making him the highest-paid player at his position in NFL history. The four-year, $120.4 million extension includes $60 million in guaranteed money and will keep the 24-year-old star with the team through the 2030 season. This contract follows another major deal for the Jets, who recently signed receiver Garrett Wilson to a large extension. Gardner, a two-time first-team All-Pro, confirmed the agreement on social media, solidifying his role as a cornerstone of the team's defense.</p>

The initiative aims to build a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging the state's energy resources, with plans including the construction of new data centers and an energy innovation training hub. The event, attended by numerous cabinet members and industry leaders, highlighted a vision for regional economic revitalization through the convergence of technology and energy.

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six counts, including two capital murder charges, for the fatal shooting of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the attempted murder of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. The U.S. Attorney's Office stated this indictment is the first step in potentially seeking the death penalty. Authorities also revealed details from a letter Boelter allegedly wrote to the FBI, in which he made bizarre claims about being a military operative and being asked by the governor to assassinate other politicians. The case is being treated as an act of targeted political violence.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information from the Jeffrey Epstein files that she deems credible, following a Justice Department review that found no evidence of a "client list." Speaking to reporters, Trump addressed pressure from his supporters and made unsubstantiated claims that the files were fabricated by political opponents. The president's comments come amid internal administration tensions and calls for greater transparency regarding the investigation into the deceased financier. Bondi has maintained that the recently released DOJ and FBI memo on the matter "speaks for itself."</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Moves to Deny Bond Hearings for Certain Immigrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:14:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly implementing a new policy to bar many immigrants who entered the country without authorization from receiving a bond hearing while they await deportation proceedings. According to an ICE memo, the administration has reinterpreted the law to mandate detention for this group, a shift from previous practice where they could request release on bond from a judge. The policy change, which is expected to face legal challenges, would significantly limit due process for millions of individuals in removal proceedings. This follows a recent congressional allocation of $45 billion to ICE for expanded immigrant detention.</p>

          <p>The UK government conducted an unprecedented secret evacuation of Afghans after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked a dataset containing their personal details in 2021. The breach put thousands who had worked with British forces at risk of Taliban retribution. The government obtained a super-injunction to prevent media reporting on the leak and the subsequent relocation effort, a measure that has only recently been lifted. Questions are now being raised about whether the injunction, while intended to protect lives, also served to prevent democratic accountability and cover up a serious governmental failure.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively encouraging Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional district maps during an upcoming special legislative session to create more GOP-friendly seats. Trump reportedly told the state's Republican delegation he wants to add five new winnable districts to help the party maintain its House majority in the midterm elections. This push for a rare mid-decade redistricting could prompt other states to follow suit, potentially leading to a nationwide battle over political maps. Critics, including Texas Democrats, have condemned the move as a desperate power grab that distracts from urgent issues like recent flood recovery.</p>
