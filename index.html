          <p>At a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Donald Trump celebrated the recent passage of a major tax and spending bill, calling it a great birthday present for America. He used the event, intended to launch the nation's 250th-anniversary celebrations, to campaign, mock opponents, and repeat false claims about the 2020 election. Trump also announced several anniversary plans, including a "Great American State Fair" and a surprising proposal to host a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds for 25,000 spectators. The speech combined policy victory laps with divisive rhetoric, typical of his campaign style.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its securities market and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. SEBI's interim order accuses the firm of engaging in a large-scale, manipulative trading strategy to artificially influence India's benchmark Nifty 50 index. The regulator claims Jane Street used large stock and futures trades to move the index, profiting from much larger bets in the options market. Jane Street has disputed the findings, stating it is committed to complying with all regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 00:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Australian hearing solutions company Cochlear has introduced its new smart implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets for the advanced technology. The device is designed for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss for whom traditional hearing aids are no longer effective. Unlike hearing aids which amplify sound, Cochlear's implant bypasses damaged inner ear cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve with electrical signals. The launch, facilitated through Hainan province and Hong Kong, represents a significant step for the company in accessing the vast Chinese healthcare market with its latest innovation.</p>

          <p>A jury in Clackamas County, Oregon, has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault and unlawful sexual penetration. The charges stemmed from an incident in October 2021 at a lake house party where McLemore sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman. Prosecutors argued the woman was incapacitated from heavy drinking and unable to consent, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The district attorney emphasized that celebrity status does not shield individuals from prosecution. McLemore, 32, played for several NBA teams, including the Portland Trail Blazers at the time of the assault.</p>

While Newsom's political advisors deny the trip is about a presidential run, focusing instead on the 2026 midterms, the choice of location is significant.

          <p>Veterans, military families, and legal experts are raising alarms over the Trump administration's deployment of active-duty troops and National Guard members in Los Angeles to quell protests. Critics argue the action pushes the boundaries of the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars using federal troops for civilian law enforcement, and sets a dangerous precedent. Advocates express concern that this "militarization" places unprepared troops in inappropriate roles against American citizens and erodes public trust. The deployment has been defended by the administration as necessary for security, but opponents see it as a threat to constitutional rights.</p>

          <h2>Data Reveals Sharpest Rise in ICE Detention is Among Immigrants Without Criminal Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 21:04:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data indicates that the most significant growth in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention population is among immigrants with no criminal convictions. According to the Deportation Data Project, this group has nearly doubled since May, now constituting about half of the 56,000 people in detention. This trend contradicts administration claims that enforcement primarily targets dangerous criminals and reflects a broader push to increase arrests. The policy has resulted in the detention and deportation of long-term residents with deep community ties, raising concerns among both critics and some supporters of the administration.</p>

          <p>An American teenager attempting to fly a small plane to every continent has been detained on King George Island in Antarctica, causing a major delay to his journey. Ethan Guo, 19, was taken into custody by Chilean authorities after allegedly submitting a false flight plan and deviating from it, which activated alert protocols. He has been charged with violating Chile's aeronautical code. Guo, who is being followed by over a million people online, was on the final leg of his quest to become the first pilot to complete solo flights across all seven continents in his Cessna aircraft.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released from immigration detention after being held for over four months. She was detained in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite having lived in the U.S. since she was eight and complying with ICE check-in requirements. During her confinement, the government attempted to deport her twice, even after a judge's order barred her removal. Sakeik, who was born in Saudi Arabia to a family from Gaza, described her experience as being criminalized for her statelessness, a situation over which she has no control.</p>

          <p>Staffing cuts and a hiring freeze at the National Park Service are leading to safety concerns at popular destinations like Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore, where lifeguard towers are shuttered. According to the National Parks Conservation Association, the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration began, and seasonal hiring is well below target. This shortage of personnel, including lifeguards, is a symptom of broader budget cuts and administrative policies affecting the agency. Local officials and advocates worry that the lack of staff puts visitors at risk, particularly during the busy summer season.</p>

The bill, approved by a narrow 218-214 vote, also enacts significant cuts to healthcare and food assistance programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years and cause millions to lose health insurance. The passage marks a major legislative victory for the Trump administration, achieved after overcoming internal Republican opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's policy direction under the Trump administration. The employees' public letter argued the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment, citing rollbacks of climate and pollution regulations. In response, the EPA accused the career staff of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and initiated an administrative investigation. This action represents a significant escalation in tensions between political leadership and career scientists within the federal government.</p>

          <p>Following mixed verdicts in his New York trial, where he was convicted on two lesser charges but acquitted of more serious ones, Sean "Diddy" Combs faces a tarnished reputation and significant jail time. While some fans celebrated the outcome, the trial revealed sordid details of his private life, likely causing irreparable damage to his public image and legacy as a hip-hop mogul. Observers are skeptical about a potential comeback, noting that while he still has supporters, the music and business worlds may be unwilling to re-engage with him. His influence had already waned in recent years, but the convictions will permanently associate his name with serious criminal behavior.</p>
