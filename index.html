            <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, previously convicted of murdering her two children, presented her closing argument in an Arizona trial where she faces conspiracy charges related to the death of her fourth husband. Daybell, representing herself, claimed the shooting was a "tragic family event" and not premeditated, while prosecutors argued she conspired with her brother to kill her husband for financial gain and to be with Chad Daybell. The prosecution highlighted text messages and religious beliefs as motives, alleging the shooting was an "execution." The jury is currently deliberating the verdict in this high-profile case.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government has finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels imported from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, following a trade case initiated by American manufacturers. The Commerce Department's decision imposes anti-dumping duties ranging from 6.1% to 271.28% and anti-subsidy countervailing duties between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country. This action aims to protect U.S. solar manufacturing investments against what domestic producers claim are unfairly cheap goods from Chinese companies operating in Southeast Asia. The tariffs represent a significant step in addressing trade imbalances in the solar energy sector.</p>

            <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that providing trials for every person the administration seeks to deport would be impractical, estimating it would take 200 years. This statement comes amid an increase in deportations of Venezuelan migrants from the United States, many without criminal records. Trump justified this stance by emphasizing the need to remove criminals and individuals illegally present in the country. The administration's stance is drawing criticism from legal advocates who argue for due process rights for all individuals facing deportation.</p>

            <p>NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe is facing a $50 million lawsuit alleging sexual assault and battery, accusations he vehemently denies through his attorney. The plaintiff claims a "rocky consensual relationship" turned abusive, with alleged sexual assaults occurring in October 2024 and January 2025. Sharpe's attorney, Lanny Davis, released sexually explicit messages purportedly sent by the plaintiff to Sharpe, arguing the relationship was consensual and the lawsuit is an attempt at blackmail.

He faces a challenging path in a heavily Democratic state, but the state's primary system allows for the possibility of a Republican making it to the general election.

            <p>The Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants is facing legal challenges in a Colorado federal court. Immigrants' rights groups argue that providing only 24 hours' notice before deportation is insufficient and violates due process rights. The ACLU contends that even alleged Nazis received more rights after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under this policy. The Supreme Court has temporarily halted some deportations, and El Salvador's president has proposed exchanging the deported migrants for political prisoners held in Venezuela.</p>

            <p>The Trump Administration will resume collections on defaulted student loans starting May 5, ending a five-year hiatus.

After this notification period, the Department will refer borrowers who remain in default to a collections program run by the Treasury Department, potentially garnishing wages later in the summer.

            <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC discussed the negative impact of the Trump administration's trade policies toward China on major tech companies like Nvidia and Apple. Cramer argued that the administration's stance of "scorched earth without military confrontation" is hurting these companies, as they are caught in the crosshairs of the trade war. He believes the government is biased against these companies, particularly Nvidia, for not preventing China from accessing their products. Cramer noted that the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policies makes it difficult to predict the future of these stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

Hospital staff reported that three of the six gunshot patients have been discharged, with two more expected to be released soon.

            <p>Tech megacap companies are entering first-quarter earnings season facing uncertainty due to President Trump's tariff policies, which have created market volatility. Tariffs are expected to impact revenue and earnings for companies that rely on imports, potentially leading to decreased ad spending and slower consumer spending. Analysts are concerned about the impact on online ad markets and the cloud business, as companies like Alphabet and Meta could be significantly affected. Despite efforts to diversify supply chains, companies like Apple and Nvidia face significant challenges related to tariffs and export restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>
