          <h2>UK Government to Amend Welfare Bill After Facing Labour Rebellion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 23:17:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to revise its welfare reform bill following significant pressure from over 100 Labour backbenchers. The proposed changes will protect existing claimants of Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and Universal Credit's health element from cuts, which will now only apply to new claimants. This concession is seen as a major climbdown by the government, which was facing a potential defeat in the House of Commons and marks the third significant policy U-turn in a month. The reforms aim to address the rising costs of health-related benefits, but the financial impact of these new changes remains unclear.</p>

          <p>A region in northern West Virginia, still recovering from deadly flash floods less than two weeks ago, is experiencing another bout of torrential rain. The Wheeling area received a flash flood warning as up to two inches of rain fell, causing creeks to overflow and threatening homes that were previously damaged. The earlier flooding event on June 14 resulted in nine fatalities and significant damage to property and infrastructure after four inches of rain fell in just 40 minutes. Emergency services are urging residents in low-lying areas to be prepared for potential evacuations.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena to Anthony Bernal, a former senior aide to Jill Biden, compelling him to testify in the ongoing Republican-led investigation into President Biden's mental fitness. The move came after Bernal reportedly withdrew from a scheduled voluntary interview, prompting Chairman James Comer to compel his appearance. This is part of a broader GOP effort, supported by President Trump, to scrutinize Biden's time in office, including the use of an autopen for official documents. Democrats have criticized the inquiry as a partisan distraction from more pressing national issues.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai is facing criticism for a recent speech in which he compared Taiwan's democratic progress to forging steel by removing all "impurities." Opposition lawmakers condemned the remarks, interpreting them as a threat to purge political dissent and justify the ruling party's efforts to recall opposition legislators. Critics likened the language to the ideological purity enforced in authoritarian states like North Korea. They are urging the public to reject what they call Lai's "dictatorship" by voting against the recalls.</p>

The reservoir's offline status during a destructive January firestorm has prompted questions and criticism from residents and officials, who are concerned that it may have contributed to water supply issues for firefighters.

          <p>Profits for China's industrial firms fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the largest monthly drop since last October and signaling that government stimulus measures are not yet reviving corporate earnings. For the first five months of 2025, cumulative profits were down 1.1% year-over-year. This data follows other mixed economic indicators, including strong retail sales but weaker industrial output. Despite the profit slump, some economists suggest Beijing may delay further stimulus, as overall GDP growth is currently tracking above the official 5% target for the year.

The prosecution detailed how Combs allegedly coerced two ex-girlfriends into participating in filmed sexual encounters with male escorts, using physical abuse and blackmail threats to ensure their compliance. The prosecutor emphasized the similar patterns in the women's testimonies, describing them as "chapters of the same book." The government argued these actions, along with witness tampering and bribery, constituted a racketeering conspiracy designed to protect Combs' "kingdom."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately selecting 6-foot-8 forward Adou Thiero from Arkansas at pick No. 36. To acquire the pick, the Lakers traded their 55th pick and cash to the Bulls for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to the Timberwolves. Thiero is described as a "super athletic wing" who is expected to provide athleticism alongside the team's stars. In other team news, guard Austin Reaves reportedly declined a four-year, $89 million maximum contract extension offer from the team.</p>

          <h2>New Audit Report Reinforces Allegations of Misspending by Former LAFD Union President</h2>

          <p>An updated audit by the International Assn. of Fire Fighters (IAFF) has reaffirmed that the former president of the Los Angeles firefighters' union, Freddy Escobar, failed to properly document over $200,000 in credit card expenses. The reexamination was conducted after Escobar provided new materials he claimed would clear him, but auditors concluded the documentation was still insufficient. The IAFF, which suspended Escobar and two other officials last month, stated that he "worked feverishly" to reconcile past expenses only after the initial audit began. A conservator has been appointed to oversee the local union and restore responsible financial stewardship.</p>
