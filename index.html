          <h2>Trump's Ire at Putin: Threat of Tariffs Over Ukraine Ceasefire</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-31 01:59:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump expressed his anger at Vladimir Putin for hindering ceasefire negotiations in Ukraine.  He threatened to impose significant tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil if a ceasefire isn't reached within a month. This represents a shift in Trump's previously conciliatory stance towards Putin, potentially driven by political expediency or a genuine concern for the ongoing conflict.  The inherent bias is Trump's self-serving actions and rhetoric, prioritizing his image over consistent foreign policy.</p>
