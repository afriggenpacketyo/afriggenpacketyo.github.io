          <p>The clean energy sector saw stock prices fall following the release of a Senate Republican spending bill that includes unfavorable provisions for the industry. The legislation proposes a new tax on wind and solar projects that use components from China and accelerates the phase-out of key production and investment tax credits. This has created significant uncertainty and execution risk for renewable energy developers, leading to a negative reaction from the market and criticism from industry leaders like Elon Musk.</p>
