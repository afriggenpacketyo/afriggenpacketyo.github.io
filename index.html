          <p>Archaeologists in Caral, Peru, have discovered the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman, carefully preserved with fabrics and macaw feathers. The findings suggest women held significant roles in the ancient Caral civilization, challenging previous assumptions about male dominance. The woman, estimated to be between 20-35 years old and about 5 feet tall, was buried with artifacts like a toucan beak and stone bowl. The Caral civilization, one of South America's oldest, existed from around 3000 BC to 1800 BC and is located in the Supe Valley.</p>

          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen have reportedly shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in less than six weeks, costing the Pentagon over $200 million. The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis since mid-March, conducting daily strikes. U.S. senators are raising concerns about civilian casualties caused by these strikes, questioning whether the Trump administration is taking sufficient measures to mitigate civilian harm. In addition to downing drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and drones at U.S. military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly waived its retaliatory 125 per cent tariffs on certain semiconductor imports from the US, according to industry sources. At least eight integrated circuit (IC)-related tariff codes were exempted from levies imposed earlier this month in response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products, though tariffs on memory chips remain. China’s customs authorities have allegedly informed domestic companies that duties paid for these exempted imports from April 10 to 24 would be eligible for refunds, though no public notice has been issued.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has spent over £600 million to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it over a decade ago. The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu gave the Post Office limited ownership of the software code, preventing them from building a replacement. This reliance on Fujitsu led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters due to errors in the Horizon system. Efforts to replace the system have been unsuccessful, and the Post Office is expected to extend its contract with Fujitsu beyond 2026.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a formal notice of intent to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione is accused of intentionally killing Thompson to amplify an ideological message and provoke resistance to the victim's industry. Prosecutors argue Mangione poses a future danger due to his intent to target an entire industry. Mangione's attorneys have argued that the government intends to kill him as a political stunt.</p>

          <p>China is sharing rare Moon rocks with researchers from six countries, including the US, despite ongoing trade tensions. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) stated that the samples are "a shared treasure for all humanity." Two Nasa-funded US institutions have been granted access to the lunar samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission in 2020. The Chang'e-5 samples are unique because they are "seem to be a billion years younger" than those collected from Apollo missions, suggesting more recent volcanic activity on the moon.</p>

          <p>The Primary School, founded by Dr. Priscilla Chan and Meredith Liu, is set to close in the summer of 2026. The school opened in 2016 and was built with the mission to serve as a tuition-free hub where children from low-income families could be educated and have access to health care and social workers under one roof. The school was built in East Palo Alto, Calif., a diverse town that rarely reaps the benefits of its far wealthier Silicon Valley neighbors.</p>
