          <p>A senior North Korean official, Ri Hyong-son, has been arrested in connection with the failed launch of a new warship, an incident that has sparked the ire of Kim Jong Un. The official, a deputy director in the ruling Workers' Party's Munitions Industry Department and part of the Central Military Commission, is considered largely responsible for the accident. This arrest follows the detention of three other officials from the Chongjin shipyard, where the destroyer was constructed and its launch went awry. Kim Jong Un attributed the incident to "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility, and unscientific empiricism," signaling a firm stance on advancing military capabilities despite setbacks. The article suggests that this public criticism and swift response are intended to demonstrate resilience and the high priority placed on warship development.</p>

          <p>Jake Wood, the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, resigned just before the launch of a new Israeli-backed aid program in Gaza, citing an inability to maintain independence and neutrality. This decision followed reports questioning the foundation's autonomy and its connections to Israel. Wood stated he could not adhere to humanitarian principles while implementing the aid plan, which aims to distribute food from sites under Israeli military control. Critics, including the United Nations, fear the plan could displace people and accelerate Israeli goals to move people from northern to southern Gaza.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, aimed at boosting sales, have raised concerns about increased competition and a potential price war in the sector. Analysts anticipate that BYD's price cuts will lead to a surge in dealership foot traffic, but they also expect strong sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan due to relatively mild competition. Shares of other Chinese automakers also declined, reflecting investor caution. (not investment advice)</p>

The issue stemmed from an error in industry data, causing Holden to be charged for a meter with the same serial number as another account.

The government intends to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system.

          <p>Four Russian nationals are on trial in Hamburg, Germany, accused of being part of the extremist "Islamic State" group. The suspects allegedly collected approximately â‚¬174,000 to send to IS members held in camps in Syria. They are charged with membership in a foreign criminal organization and supporting a foreign terrorist organization. The German authorities emphasize that the threat posed by religious extremists remains significant, despite an increase in far-right violence and crime.</p>

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by using the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation within U.S. customs law. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. For example, a U.S. retailer can pay the import duty on the initial factory price rather than a vendor's inflated price. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under U.S. President Donald Trump's administrations, offering potential cost savings for companies willing to navigate the complexities.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming in June, as part of efforts to reduce reliance on imported seafood. The Su Hai No 1 vessel, built at a cost of 600 million yuan (US$83.6 million), is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the vessel can quickly relocate to safer waters to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility for rapid delivery to domestic markets. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening the nation's food supply.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep allows the brain to enter a repair mode, flushing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals accumulated during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, deciphers how hydrogen peroxide (Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚) triggers sleep and restores balance in the brain. It confirms that rising Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ levels in sleep-regulating neurons prompt restorative slumber, while excess build-up disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation. This offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions like Alzheimerâ€™s disease and opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress.</p>
