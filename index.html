          <p>President Trump's apparent decision to scale back efforts to end the war in Ukraine has been met with disappointment, but not surprise, by many Ukrainians who feel they have little choice but to continue fighting. Despite Trump's initial promises to swiftly end the conflict, a recent call with President Putin has led to a perceived reduction in U.S. pressure on Moscow, causing disillusionment in Ukraine. Many Ukrainians believe that Putin is using diplomacy as a cover for intensified attacks and that they must rely on their own resources and support from other allies. The article underscores the resilience and determination of Ukrainians amidst rising civilian deaths and ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced plans to significantly decrease his political donations after spending over $250 million supporting Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Musk indicated that he feels he has "done enough" and does not currently see a reason to continue spending at the same scale, despite his previous high-profile involvement in political initiatives. This decision follows a political setback earlier in the year when a candidate he backed for the Wisconsin Supreme Court was defeated. Musk also reaffirmed his commitment to leading Tesla for the next five years amidst concerns about his focus on political endeavors affecting the company's performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's efforts to persuade House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill have failed, as the "SALT Caucus" remains opposed due to insufficient increases in state and local tax deductions. The intra-party conflict centers on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes on federal income tax returns, capped at $10,000 in 2017. A proposal to raise the deduction to $30,000 is deemed inadequate by several GOP lawmakers from high-tax states. Sources indicate that five members of the SALT Caucus remain "no" votes despite Trump's visit and proposed adjustments to the cap.</p>

          <p>A new law in Washington state mandating priests to report child abuse disclosed during confessions has ignited a fierce debate, with the Catholic Church threatening to excommunicate priests who comply. The Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation into the law, claiming it infringes upon First Amendment rights. Supporters of the law argue it is essential to protect children, while critics contend that it violates the sanctity of confession and could deter individuals from seeking help. The Seattle Archdiocese insists that breaking the confidence of confession results in immediate excommunication, emphasizing the church's commitment to protecting the sacrament.</p>

          <p>A new book titled 'Original Sin' alleges that former President Joe Biden concealed his son Beau's cancer diagnosis from the public, misleading them about his health. The authors claim that Biden and his son intentionally portrayed Beau as having a "clean bill of health" despite knowing about his advanced glioblastoma. The book suggests that Beau Biden continued to serve as Delaware's attorney general while secretly undergoing treatments and exhibiting signs of deterioration. A Biden spokesperson has refuted these allegations, asserting that the book fails to prove any wrongdoing or cover-up on Joe Biden's part.</p>

          <p>Member states of the World Health Organization have overwhelmingly approved the first-ever pandemic agreement, a treaty aimed at preventing, preparing for, and responding to future pandemics. The treaty outlines a framework for pandemic prevention through surveillance and effective responses via protective equipment and aligned regulatory systems. However, its impact is uncertain due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms and robust funding. The United States' absence from the agreement, stemming from President Trump's planned withdrawal from WHO, further weakens its potential. The treaty's ultimate success hinges on resolving contentious details regarding resource sharing and internal ratification by 60 countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump cautioned House Republicans against making changes to Medicaid during a closed-door meeting, urging them to pass a major tax bill. The tax bill's progress has been hindered by a faction of Republicans seeking cuts to Medicaid and the implementation of work requirements for eligibility. Critics argue that work requirements would create bureaucratic challenges and burden the government with verifying employment status for millions of people. Medicaid, jointly funded by the federal government and states, provides healthcare coverage to nearly 80 million Americans.</p>

          <h2>Advanced Prostate Cancer Can Evade Detection Despite Screening, Experts Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite regular screening, aggressive prostate cancer can remain undetected until it has advanced, as highlighted by the recent diagnosis of former President Biden. Medical experts emphasize that even diligent men may develop aggressive cancer after recent checkups showed no signs of the disease. The PSA test, commonly used for screening, is not foolproof and can sometimes miss fast-growing cancers. Guidelines recommend against screening after age 70, as most prostate cancers in older men are slow-growing and unlikely to cause harm. The article underscores the limitations of prostate cancer screening and the potential risks associated with treatment.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced stricter regulatory guidelines for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring new clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy for healthy adults and children. This marks a shift from previous approvals based on antibody response tests. The FDA will accept immunogenicity data for high-risk individuals, such as those over 65 or with underlying health conditions, but will demand randomized, controlled trials showing clinical outcomes for healthy individuals. This change comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls health agencies and U.S. immunization policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vladimir Putin discussed potential trade opportunities between Russia and the United States, rather than focusing on sanctions or ending the war in Ukraine, according to reports. While Trump expressed optimism about a ceasefire and large-scale trade, Putin's reaction was more measured, emphasizing the need to address the "root causes" of the war. Analysts suggest that Putin's strategy involves stalling negotiations and avoiding actions that might provoke Trump to support Ukraine more actively. This approach has raised concerns about the future of Ukraine and its European allies.</p>

          <p>Two new research studies highlight the potential life-saving impact of Medicaid, adding to the ongoing political debate over the program's future. One study found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) saved approximately 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Another study examined the effects of Medicaid on dual-eligible individuals, finding that those who lost Medicaid coverage also lost vital Medicare benefits, leading to decreased prescription drug use and increased mortality. The findings suggest that proposed cuts to Medicaid and increased eligibility checks could have deadly consequences, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>

The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) will gather biometric data on citizens from non-EU countries, including the UK.

Parker distinguishes between two types of hate: elemental hate, which is rare and dehumanizing, and petty hate, which is more common and related to psychic atomization. He suggests detaching from technology, unplugging the ego, and being kinder to neighbors and oneself as ways to combat the latter. He also addresses the overuse of the word "existential", defending its relevance in the current era.</p>
