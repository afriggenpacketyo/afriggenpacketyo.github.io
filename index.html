        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has nullified the nearly half-billion-dollar financial penalty imposed on President Trump and his company in their civil fraud case, deeming it an "excessive fine" under the Eighth Amendment. While the monetary punishment was thrown out, the five-judge panel upheld the lower court's finding that Trump and his executives engaged in fraudulent activities by misrepresenting his net worth for financial benefits. The panel was divided on the case's overall merits, with differing opinions on the attorney general's authority and the trial's procedural aspects. Despite the upheld fraud finding, Trump and his sons have claimed the ruling as a "total victory."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he will personally accompany police and military forces patrolling Washington, D.C., portraying the action as a necessary response to a significant crime issue in the city. This move follows the recent mobilization of the National Guard, which the administration justified by citing escalating crime rates. The announcement comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance and other officials visited National Guard troops, where they encountered public protests. The president's direct participation in on-the-ground patrols marks an unconventional escalation of his administration's focus on law and order, signaling a hands-on approach to federal intervention in the capital's municipal affairs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and European Union have outlined a new trade framework that includes a 15% American tariff on European cars and pharmaceuticals, while the EU will eliminate tariffs on U.S. industrial exports. This agreement, which serves as a foundation for future negotiations, aims to prevent President Trump's previous threat of a 30% tariff rate. The pact also includes significant commitments for the EU to purchase $750 billion in energy and $40 billion in U.S. AI chips, alongside increased procurement of American military equipment. Both parties praised the deal as a step toward a more balanced and mutually beneficial trade relationship, intended to reinvigorate their respective economies.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Major Drawbacks of Reverse Mortgages for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 13:13:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages, often considered a solution for retirees to access home equity, come with significant disadvantages that homeowners should carefully evaluate. These financial products typically involve high upfront fees, closing costs, and insurance premiums that can diminish the equity being accessed. Furthermore, the loan balance grows over time as interest compounds, reducing the inheritance for heirs and potentially leading to the loss of the home if the borrower fails to pay property taxes and insurance. Homeowners must maintain the property as their primary residence, creating complications if they need to move into long-term care facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Recent Study Shows Nearly Half of U.S. Adults Order from Kids' Menus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 13:11:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey reveals that 44% of American adults are ordering kids' meals at restaurants, a trend driven by a desire to save money and consume smaller portions amid rising food costs. This shift in consumer behavior comes as fast-food prices have significantly increased over the last decade, with some meal prices more than doubling.

          <p>Cracker Barrel experienced a significant stock plunge, wiping out almost $200 million in market value, following the unveiling of a new, more modern logo. The redesign removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, which the company stated represented the old country store experience. This change is part of a broader effort by the 55-year-old chain to refresh its image and menu to remain relevant. The move has drawn criticism from conservative commentators and marketing experts, who argue the company is abandoning a brand identity that customers felt connected to, leading to a sharp negative reaction from investors.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after receiving a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, initiated by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, accuses Cook of potential mortgage fraud related to claiming two different properties as her primary residence. A DOJ attorney sent a letter urging Fed Chair Jerome Powell to fire Cook, although Powell lacks the legal authority to do so. Cook has stated she has no intention of resigning over the allegations, which she learned of through social media, and is gathering information to address any legitimate questions about her financial history.</p>

          <p>A Memphis jury has found Hernandez Govan not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2021 killing of rapper Young Dolph. Govan was accused of organizing the fatal shooting at a local bakery, but his defense attorney successfully questioned the police investigation and the reliability of key witnesses. The prosecution's case heavily relied on the testimony of Cornelius Smith Jr., an admitted shooter in the ambush, who claimed Govan hired him. Young Dolph, a beloved Memphis native known for his charitable work, was shot approximately 20 times in the attack, which prosecutors linked to a rivalry with another record label.</p>

The government will now cover wages and costs while seeking a buyer for the plant.

In his new special and recent interviews, he suggests that figures like Joe Rogan and Theo Von have created a culture where shock value trumps substance, ultimately facilitating a dangerous political climate.

          <h2>Analysis of UK Asylum Data Reveals Mixed Results for Government Strategy</h2>

          <p>Recent Home Office data presents a complex view of the UK government's asylum strategy, showing both challenges and potential progress. While the number of asylum applications reached a record high of 111,000 in the year to June, the government has successfully reduced the overall backlog by accelerating processing times. The number of asylum seekers in hotels has seen a slight increase but remains far below the 2023 peak. However, small boat landings have risen by 38% compared to the previous year. The data suggests that while faster processing is helping manage accommodation pressures, the high volume of arrivals and legal appeals continues to pose a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian dancehall artist Shatta Wale has been granted bail after being taken into custody for questioning regarding his purchase of a 2019 Lamborghini Urus. Ghana's Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) is investigating the vehicle, which U.S. authorities have identified as proceeds from a $4 million crime involving a Ghanaian national currently jailed in the United States. Investigators state that Wale has been unable to identify the seller, claiming he bought the car "from the 'Street'" and lacks proper ownership documents. The singer's management maintains he is cooperating voluntarily with the investigation and purchased the vehicle in good faith.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A satirical article critiques President Donald Trump's recent social media post in which he condemned museums like the Smithsonian for being "WOKE" and focusing on negative aspects of American history such as slavery. The piece humorously imagines Trump's ideal museum as one filled with objects from the future, like hoverboards and lightsabers, and devoid of any historical reflection that might make visitors feel bad. The satire portrays this vision as a rejection of learning from the past in favor of a simplistic, self-aggrandizing experience. It frames his criticism as a misunderstanding of a museum's purpose, equating it to a desire for an experience more akin to an Apple Store.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone are investigating the $8 billion merger of Paramount and Skydance Media, questioning whether the companies conceded to improper demands from President Donald Trump to secure regulatory approval. The probe focuses on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to Trump to resolve a lawsuit over a "60 Minutes" interview, which the lawmakers suggest could be an "illegal bribe" in exchange for the FCC's blessing of the merger. Their letter demands internal communications involving Trump, the White House, and the FCC, and raises concerns about potential agreements to alter CBS News' editorial practices to align with the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>Apple is raising the monthly subscription price for its Apple TV+ streaming service by $3, bringing the new cost to $12.99 in the U.S. and other markets. This marks the third price increase for the service since its launch in 2019 at $4.99 per month. The new price will affect current subscribers 30 days after their next renewal date, while the annual subscription cost will remain unchanged. This move aligns with a broader industry trend of streaming services increasing prices to fund new content and improve profitability, following similar hikes by competitors like Netflix and Peacock earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is actively recruiting its civilian employees for a "volunteer force" to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. An internal email and job posting call for volunteers to take on temporary assignments of up to 180 days at immigration facilities across the U.S., performing duties like data entry and logistical support. This initiative stems from a June directive by the Defense Secretary authorizing the deployment of civilian staff to support DHS operations. The move signals a significant expansion of resources for immigration enforcement, leveraging the Defense Department's vast civilian workforce to bolster ICE's capacity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the increasingly mainstream narrative that public health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic were known to be ineffective and did more harm than good. It argues that this revisionist view misrepresents the pre-pandemic scientific consensus and misinterprets data, such as Sweden's mortality rates, which improved largely due to a successful vaccine rollout rather than a lack of restrictions. While acknowledging that some measures like school closures lasted too long, the author contends that dismissing all non-pharmaceutical interventions as useless is a dangerous overcorrection. This mindset could undermine public trust and leave society unprepared for future, potentially deadlier, pandemics.</p>

For over two decades, the company has offered a unique blend of Mexican professional wrestling (lucha libre) and burlesque at the 98-year-old theater. The Mayan's management announced its closure due to significant adversity over the past five years, making the decision a matter of necessity. Lucha VaVoom's farewell performance, themed "The Good, the Bad and the Fabulous," is a bittersweet event for the performers and fans who have considered the venue a home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) continue to offer attractive returns, with many banks providing rates near 4% despite a slight cooling from their 2023 peaks. A $25,000 deposit can yield varied earnings depending on the term length: a 3-month CD at 4.30% would earn about $269, while a 1-year CD at the same rate would generate approximately $1,075. For those willing to commit longer, a 5-year CD at 4.20% could produce around $5,250 in interest. The primary appeal of CDs is their fixed rates, which provide stability and predictable growth compared to variable-rate savings accounts, making them a safe option for savers.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes rose by 2% in July, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units, contrary to analysts' expectations of a decline. This uptick is likely due to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were signed. Housing inventory also increased by 15.7% compared to last year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal year-over-year increase of 0.2%, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point where affordability could slowly improve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A photo essay explores the complex emotional landscape of parents whose children have left home, a phase commonly known as the "empty nest." Through intimate portraits and interviews with 14 individuals and couples in Los Angeles, the project reveals that this transition is far from uniform. For some, it brings a profound sense of loss and disorientation, while for others, it marks a period of newfound freedom, renewal, and self-discovery. The stories highlight the fluidity of modern family life, with some nests being repopulated by returning children. The project illustrates that this stage is a nuanced blend of grief and liberation, challenging the singular, often melancholic, image of the empty nest.</p>

He emotionally abused members and sexually assaulted numerous women, often during late-night massages performed by a team of unpaid female assistants. The service, once praised by church leaders for its innovative approach, collapsed in 1995 amid the initial allegations of sexual abuse.</p>
