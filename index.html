          <p>At least two firefighters were killed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being shot at while responding to a wildfire. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office reported that first responders were under active sniper fire from a suspect using high-powered rifles, prompting a shelter-in-place order for residents near Canfield Mountain. The situation is described as active and ongoing, with law enforcement preparing to neutralize the suspect in what could become a multi-day operation. The FBI is en route to provide tactical support in response to what Idaho's governor called a "heinous direct assault" on emergency personnel.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing frustration with partisan gridlock and a desire to spend more time with family. His decision came shortly after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him for opposing the "big, beautiful bill," a major tax and spending package. Tillis criticized the bill's proposed Medicaid cuts as devastating for his state and lamented that independent, bipartisan thinking has become an "endangered species" in Washington. The announcement opens up a key Senate seat in a historically Republican state.</p>

          <p>Brigham Young University quarterback Jake Retzlaff plans to enter the transfer portal for his final year of eligibility, reportedly anticipating a seven-game suspension from the school. The suspension stems from an honor code violation related to a sexual assault allegation made against him in a civil lawsuit filed in May. Retzlaff, who is not facing criminal charges, denies the allegations of a November 2023 incident, claiming the encounter was consensual. His attorneys have accused the woman of extortion, suggesting the lawsuit is timed to his emergence as an NFL Draft prospect.</p>

          <p>A female prosecutor in Osaka, Japan, is facing significant backlash after accusing her former boss, chief prosecutor Kentaro Kitagawa, of sexual assault in 2018. The prosecutor, identified by the pseudonym Hikari, alleges she was not only assaulted but also subjected to a campaign to silence her and was slandered by a colleague. Kitagawa, who initially admitted to the charge, has since recanted and pleaded not guilty, claiming the encounter was consensual. The case highlights the challenges faced by victims in Japan's hierarchical legal system and is seen as a significant #MeToo moment for the country.</p>

          <p>The League of Social Democrats, considered the last functioning pro-democracy party in Hong Kong, has announced its dissolution ahead of the fifth anniversary of Beijing's national security law. The party cited "immense political pressure" as the reason for its decision, stating it might have faced consequences otherwise. This move effectively marks the end of the city's organized pro-democracy political bloc, which has been systematically dismantled since the implementation of the sweeping security legislation. The dissolution raises further doubts about the future of political autonomy and opposition voices within Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was first imposed in August 2023. The ban was a strong protest against Japan's decision to release treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. Following an agreement reached in May to resume trade, procedural steps are now underway to restart shipments. However, it may take several months before Japanese seafood products are fully available again in the Chinese market, marking a significant, albeit slow, de-escalation in economic tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is pledging a more focused effort to combat a significant rise in attacks against religious facilities, which have nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon described the assaults on churches, synagogues, and mosques as a form of terrorism meant to intimidate communities of faith. Recent cases include convictions for planned attacks and arson, with perpetrators receiving lengthy prison sentences. The Southern Poverty Law Center notes that the trend is partly driven by white nationalism and the targeting of minority groups or congregations welcoming to LGBTQ+ communities.</p>

The Riverside Fire Department, with assistance from Cal-Fire and other mutual-aid companies, battled the four-alarm fire.

Enthusiasts use trail cams and search for physical evidence, convinced the marsupial predator still roams the Tasmanian bush. In a parallel effort, scientists at the University of Melbourne are leading a $15 million de-extinction project, aiming to edit the DNA of the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart, to bring the species back. While some experts remain skeptical of both approaches, the enduring passion reflects a collective hope and perhaps remorse over the animal's extinction.</p>

The album belonged to SS officer Karl HÃ¶cker and contains 116 images of officers and staff singing, socializing, and relaxing, even as the systematic murder of over a million people, mostly Jews, was occurring nearby. The photos, which include the only known images of Dr. Josef Mengele at the camp, are the subject of a Pulitzer-nominated play, "Here There Are Blueberries." Historians and survivors find the images terrifying because they show the perpetrators' apparent lack of remorse and their capacity for normalcy while participating in genocide.</p>

Herzog, who never attended film school, emphasizes the need for "good criminal energy" and real-life experience to create authentic cinema. He continues to work constantly, viewing the finished film as the ultimate "loot" from his often-harrowing but artistically rewarding adventures.</p>

          <p>The Principality of Sealand, a micronation established on a former World War II anti-aircraft fort seven miles off the English coast, continues its unique existence. Founded in 1967 by Roy Bates as a "romantic gesture" for his wife, the state has its own constitution, currency, and a single permanent resident. Over the decades, the "royal family" has defended their territory from rival pirate radio broadcasters and even staged a counter-coup against German and Dutch plotters. Today, Sealand sustains itself by selling noble titles online, embodying a quirky and enduring story of independence and defiance.</p>

          <p>A growing workforce of "human-in-the-loop" data labelers in countries like Kenya report being overworked, underpaid, and psychologically damaged while training AI for major U.S. tech companies.

These jobs are often outsourced through intermediary firms, shielding companies like Meta and OpenAI from direct accountability.

          <p>A deeper look into the Karl HÃ¶cker photo album from Auschwitz reveals the roles of the "Helferinnen," or young female "helpers," who worked as secretaries and communications operators at the camp. These women, often recruited from the Nazi League of German Girls, were not just clerical staff but active participants in the genocide, relaying information about train arrivals and the number of people sent to be gassed. The photos show them smiling and socializing, a stark contrast to their monstrous work.

          <p>The United States faces significant challenges in stopping drone swarms over its territory due to a combination of technical limitations, legal restrictions, and bureaucratic hurdles. Standard radar often fails to track small, low-flying drones, and countermeasures like shooting them down or jamming their frequencies pose significant risks to civilian aircraft and infrastructure. Jurisdictional confusion among agencies like the FAA, FBI, and Department of Defense further complicates a coordinated response. To address this, NORAD is developing "fly-away kits" with advanced anti-drone technology to be deployed to besieged installations, though a comprehensive solution remains a work in progress.</p>

While the 787 has a strong overall safety record, its production has been plagued by quality control issues and serious allegations from multiple whistleblowers. Former employees have claimed that pressure to speed up production led to the use of substandard parts and improper assembly, creating potential hidden defects. While Boeing denies these claims compromise safety, the crash has brought these long-standing concerns about the company's manufacturing culture back into sharp focus.</p>

The crackdown has sparked a rare online debate and pushback against what critics call outdated and discriminatory obscenity laws.
