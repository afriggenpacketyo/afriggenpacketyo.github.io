          <p>This opinion article supports New York City Mayor Eric Adams's policy to ban face masks in certain public areas, framing it as a necessary measure for public safety rather than an infringement on free speech. The author cites legal precedent, specifically the Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v. Kerik case, to argue that there is no constitutional right to anonymous protest. The piece contends the ban is a content-neutral regulation designed to prevent crime and hold lawbreakers accountable, thereby protecting all New Yorkers from individuals who exploit anonymity to cause harm.</p>

          <p>Rocket manufacturer Firefly Aerospace has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FLY." This move comes amid a recovering IPO market, following a downturn in 2022. The Texas-based company, known for its Alpha rockets and the Blue Ghost lunar lander, reported a significant revenue increase to $55.9 million as of March, although its net loss also grew. With a reported backlog of $1.1 billion, the IPO is being underwritten by major financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies, following a temporary pause on some critical arms shipments last week. The halt had raised concerns in Kyiv, particularly regarding Patriot air defense systems needed to counter a surge in Russian aerial attacks. The renewed aid comes after a deal announced by U.S. President Donald Trump where NATO will purchase Patriot systems from the U.S. for distribution to Ukraine, with allies like Germany and Norway helping to fund the purchase.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash that killed 270 people has found that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were moved to the "off" position just seconds after takeoff. According to the report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. While one engine began to regain thrust, the other did not, leading to the crash. The report does not assign blame or explain how the switches were flipped.</p>

          <p>This satirical article critiques the current state of NASA, highlighting significant workforce reductions, proposed budget cuts, and the appointment of former reality-TV star Sean Duffy as interim head. The author sarcastically suggests that space exploration is an outdated concept and that the new leadership is more suited for managing the agency's decline than for pursuing ambitious new missions. The piece humorously posits that faking a Mars landing and deporting scientists are more in line with the current administration's priorities, concluding that space travel is now best left to billionaires.</p>

          <p>Prominent Los Angeles area politicians, including County Supervisor Janice Hahn and Congresswoman Linda Sánchez, are criticizing the Whittier City Council for what they describe as a slow response to recent immigration raids that have instilled fear in the community. A proposal was introduced to require federal agents to be identifiable and unmasked during operations, but the council delayed a decision for a month to study the issue. This delay has been condemned by local leaders and residents as minimizing the trauma experienced by the immigrant community, who are demanding more immediate action.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if President Donald Trump proceeds with a threatened 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. Trump's threat is explicitly linked to his opposition to the criminal trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula stated he would invoke a reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war. The move by the U.S. is seen as an unprecedented use of trade policy to interfere in another nation's domestic judicial affairs. (not investment advice)</p>

Her successful return to the highest level of competition, which included a semifinal victory over the world's top-ranked player, is a powerful story of resilience and prioritizing personal well-being in professional sports.</p>
