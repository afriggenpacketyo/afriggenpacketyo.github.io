          <p>The Trump administration has brokered an unusual deal with Nvidia and AMD, allowing them to sell specific AI chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue from those sales. This arrangement grants the companies export licenses for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export controls but had been previously banned. While analysts see this as a transactional move typical of the current administration, investors view it as a net positive, as it restores access to the lucrative Chinese market. The deal raises questions about future government involvement in corporate sales and China's reaction to what is effectively a tariff at the source. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the Washington, D.C. police department will be placed under direct federal control, invoking the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. In a news conference, he stated the action was necessary to address what he described as rising crime and deteriorating conditions in the nation's capital, also deploying the National Guard to reestablish order. This move comes despite official police data showing an overall decrease in crime compared to the previous year. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has contested the president's claims, highlighting that violent crime has been driven down to a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>Dartford councillor Ricky Jones is on trial for allegedly encouraging violent disorder during a counter-protest in Walthamstow. The prosecution claims that in a tense atmosphere, Mr. Jones used a public address system to call far-right protesters "disgusting Nazi fascists" and gestured that their throats should be slit. The court heard that the event had a "tinderbox" atmosphere, with police concerned about potential violence, although the far-right group did not appear. Prosecutors argue that Jones was "rabble rousing" a large crowd and was aware of the volatile national climate at the time, making his actions particularly reckless.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed five Al Jazeera journalists, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who had recently expressed fears for his life. Israel claimed responsibility for the strike, alleging al-Sharif was a Hamas operative, a claim Al Jazeera and press freedom groups have condemned as part of a pattern of unsubstantiated accusations against Palestinian journalists. The incident has intensified criticism of Israel's actions, with organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists stating that at least 178 media workers have been killed in the conflict. Al Jazeera described the attack as a "targeted assassination" aimed at silencing one of the few media outlets providing on-the-ground coverage from within Gaza.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall and severe storms have caused widespread flash flooding across several Midwest states, leading to at least one death, power outages, and road closures. In eastern Nebraska, one person was killed when a tree fell on their vehicle during a storm with wind gusts up to 90 mph. The Milwaukee area was particularly hard-hit, receiving up to 14 inches of rain, which prompted numerous water rescues and the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair. Emergency crews have been responding to hundreds of calls for assistance, and officials are warning residents to avoid hazardous floodwaters as more rain is forecasted.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's request to release grand jury testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal case, criticizing the Department of Justice's reasoning as "demonstrably false." Judge Paul Engelmayer stated the materials would not reveal significant new information about Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell's crimes and suggested the motion might be a political "diversion." He emphasized that the records do not identify other co-conspirators or provide new details about Epstein's death, and that releasing them would mislead the public into expecting new revelations. This decision follows pressure on the administration to release more files related to the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>Enterprise AI firm C3 AI saw its stock fall sharply after announcing disappointing preliminary first-quarter financial results and a sales organization restructuring. The company projects revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million, a significant drop from the $87.2 million reported in the same period last year. CEO Thomas Siebel attributed the poor performance to the disruptive reorganization and his own health issues, which limited his involvement in the sales process. The company also anticipates a much wider operating loss, and Siebel, who is currently searching for his successor, stated the results were "completely unacceptable" but expressed confidence in the company's future acceleration.

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has successfully restored water flow to over 9,000 residents in the San Fernando Valley communities of Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. The disruption was caused by the failure of a valve installed in 1967 during repairs at a local pump station. Although service is back, a boil water notice remains in effect, advising residents to use boiled or bottled water for drinking and cooking until water quality testing is complete. The repair was complex, as workers had to navigate around other utility lines, including fiber-optic cables and a high-pressure gas line, to access the broken valve.</p>

The bill would also allow for wrongful death lawsuits if the medication harms a fetus or the mother.

Consumers should carefully consider their travel habits and whether a general or brand-specific card best suits their needs.</p>

          <h2>Financial Expert Advises Savers to 'Act Quick' to Secure High Interest Rates Before Potential Fed Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady but expected to cut them later in the year, a financial analyst advises savers to lock in current high yields on their cash. Options include high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer rates over 4%, and certificates of deposit (CDs), which provide a fixed rate for a set term. The article notes that while savings account rates will fall with any Fed cut, a CD allows savers to secure today's higher rates for a longer period. The piece suggests a strategy of laddering CDs with different maturities to balance accessibility and high returns before the opportunity diminishes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will end its iconic dial-up internet service on September 30, marking the end of an era for many who first connected to the web in the 1990s. The service, famous for its screeching connection tone and the "You've Got Mail" greeting, was a cornerstone of early internet culture. While only a small fraction of U.S. households, approximately 163,000 as of 2023, still use dial-up, the decision represents a final disconnection from the early days of the commercial internet. The company stated the move is part of a routine evaluation of its products and services.</p>

The proposed changes, part of a new road safety strategy, also consider lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's stricter standard. This follows a coroner's report that labeled the UK's driver licensing system the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The government believes current safety messaging is ineffective and aims to impose tougher penalties to reduce the number of road fatalities and injuries.</p>

The move to Everton, while not offering European football, provides Grealish an opportunity to rejuvenate his career with regular playing time at the club's new stadium.

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in China saw a 5% month-on-month decline in July, totaling 1.26 million units, the first drop since May. The slowdown is attributed to weaker consumer demand as automakers narrowed the significant price cuts that had been driving sales. The average discount on cars fell from an unprecedented 17.4% in June to 16.7% in July, following a government warning against escalating price wars. Analysts suggest that Chinese car buyers have become highly price-sensitive, and the reduction in discounts is likely to temper the industry's previously booming growth in the coming months.

This passive investing strategy is echoed by Buffett, who has long advised that most investors will outperform professionals by periodically investing in a diversified, low-cost S&P 500 index fund rather than trying to pick individual winning stocks.
