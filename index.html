          <p>Jen Pawol made sports history by becoming the first female umpire to officiate a Major League Baseball regular-season game, working at first base during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut was met with a warm reception from fans and players, and she made her first significant call in the third inning. Following the historic game, Pawol donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone. The 48-year-old's promotion comes after years of umpiring in the minor leagues, marking a significant moment for baseball.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a market slowdown due to post-pandemic economic pressures and potential trade wars. Factors such as inflation, changing consumer habits among younger generations, and retaliatory tariffs have contributed to declining sales for major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey. This has led to an oversupply of bourbon, driving down prices and causing financial distress for some distilleries, including recent bankruptcies. Industry experts warn that more consolidation and financial casualties are likely as the market corrects itself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has publicly called on his mayoral opponent, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, to vacate his rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria. Cuomo argues that Mamdani, whom he describes as "very rich" due to his income and property ownership, is occupying affordable housing that a family in need could use. This criticism is part of Cuomo's independent campaign against Mamdani, highlighting the city's severe affordability crisis where median rent has soared. Cuomo's campaign frames the issue as a matter of moral clarity for a political leader.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable portfolio of federally funded patents. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching its legal obligations tied to federal research grants and initiated a "march-in" process that could allow the government to seize the patents. This action intensifies pressure on Harvard, which the administration has already targeted over its handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests. The university, which holds over 5,800 patents, has previously sued the administration for withholding federal research funds.</p>

          <p>The booming market for functional beverages, which promise benefits like relaxation and stress relief, is facing scrutiny from health experts. Nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine in these drinks can produce their advertised effects. Recently, an ad by the popular brand Trip was banned for making unproven health claims about managing stress and anxiety. While some consumers find the drinks to be a good non-alcoholic alternative for unwinding, psychologists suggest the calming effect may be more of a placebo, created by the ritual of taking a mindful break.</p>

Once part of a thriving community of dozens of hawkers, he is now the sole practitioner of his trade, a decline he attributes to the rise of digital news. Despite dwindling sales, Akbar continues his work for the joy and independence it brings, having become an iconic part of the Saint-Germain neighborhood.</p>

          <p>In the Peruvian settlement of Pampa Clemesí, residents live in darkness despite being situated next to the country's largest solar power complex. The Rubí and Clemesí plants can power over 350,000 homes, yet the 150 villagers have no connection to the national grid, relying on candles, torches, or unaffordable battery systems for donated solar panels. The company operating the plant states it has fulfilled its obligations by building a dedicated power line, but the final connection to homes remains the government's responsibility, which has been delayed. This paradox highlights a broader issue in Peru where infrastructure development often bypasses remote, sparsely populated communities.</p>

The diplomatic effort comes as Israel's plan to take over Gaza City faces strong international condemnation from allies and other nations, who fear it will worsen the humanitarian crisis.

The statement reflects Ukrainian and European anxieties that a bilateral U.S.-Russia meeting could sideline their interests.

          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran recently faced social media debate after describing himself as "culturally Irish," despite being born and raised in England. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection, stating that Ireland shaped his musical tastes during childhood holidays. The controversy highlights the complex and evolving nature of cultural identity, particularly for the second-generation Irish in Britain. Experts and cultural figures note that in the post-Good Friday Agreement era, identity is less about rigid binaries and more about personal connection, heritage, and a blend of influences, a sentiment reflected across modern Irish arts and culture.</p>

While Sotheby's maintains that all international procedures were followed, critics like paleontologist Paul Sereno argue the sale violates Nigerien heritage laws.

This phenomenon reflects a broader appreciation for "junk film," where movies are so earnestly bad they become entertaining cult classics.

While security concerns about data sharing with China persist, some U.S. startups continue to use DeepSeek to cut costs.

          <p>A group of masked thieves broke into a store in the Los Angeles area and stole around $7,000 worth of Labubu dolls, a popular collectible item. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported that the suspects used a stolen truck in the early morning heist and that the vehicle was later recovered. The targeted store, One Stop Shop, shared surveillance footage of the break-in, showing several people in hoodies ransacking the establishment and carrying out boxes of inventory.

          <p>More than 40 million people across the United States are under alerts for dangerous heat and critical fire weather conditions this weekend. Extreme Heat Warnings are in effect for parts of the Southwest, including Phoenix and Palm Springs, with temperatures expected to reach up to 115 degrees. Widespread heat advisories also stretch across the Plains and are building in the Northwest, where some areas could see highs between 97 and 110 degrees. In addition, critical fire weather alerts are active in four western states due to low humidity and gusty winds, which create conditions conducive to rapid wildfire spread.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has started her partnership with new coach Francisco Roig on a positive note, securing a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Olga Danilovic in the second round of the Cincinnati Open. Despite a slow start, Raducanu demonstrated her increasing match toughness and reliability against lower-ranked opponents, patiently defending and capitalizing on her opponent's errors in the sweltering heat. She noted that Roig is already helping her improve the quality of her shots and that she trusts the work they are doing. A more significant challenge awaits in the third round, where she will face either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego received an enthusiastic response at a town hall in Iowa as he criticized the Republican-backed tax bill, claiming it would make "America poorer and sicker." The event signals a broader Democratic offensive against the legislation, which they see as a key vulnerability for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. Gallego and other Democrats are holding rallies in competitive districts to highlight the bill's cuts to programs like Medicaid and its perceived benefits for the wealthy. The energized opposition contrasts with the jeers some Republican lawmakers have faced while trying to promote the new law.</p>

          <p>The Chief Financial Officer of Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Dawn Norton, who earned $210,000 a year in Wilton, claims she had kept her Connecticut superiors fully informed and had been working remotely while on family medical leave. However, Wilton's town administrator stated they were unaware of her full-time role in Wyoming until it was discovered online. The controversy emerged amid an ongoing review of Wilton's finance department due to concerns over understaffing and material weaknesses identified by auditors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans to immediately deport foreign criminals after they receive a custodial sentence, rather than having them serve time in British prisons. Under the proposal, those with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away, with their destination country deciding if they serve any remaining sentence. The government claims this would save taxpayers money, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics, however, warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported criminals, questioning the feasibility of the plan. The law would not apply to those serving life sentences for severe crimes like terrorism.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA for posting a tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid that omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that Obeid, known as the "Pele of Palestinian football," was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. UEFA's social media post praised Obeid as a talent who gave hope but made no mention of how he died. Salah responded directly on X, asking UEFA to clarify "how he died, where, and why," drawing attention to the sensitive context surrounding the footballer's death.</p>

          <p>British police arrested 474 people in central London during a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned under terrorism laws. Protesters intentionally defied the ban by displaying signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action" outside the Houses of Parliament. The demonstration was organized to challenge the proscription, which activists argue illegally restricts freedom of expression. The government banned the group following an incident where activists broke into an RAF base to protest UK support for Israel. This mass arrest marks one of the largest by London's Metropolitan Police in a single day in the last decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over demands for confidential taxpayer data to locate undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security had requested the IRS to cross-check a list of 40,000 names, but the agency could only verify a small fraction and refused to hand over addresses, citing taxpayer privacy rights. This resistance appears to have conflicted with the administration's goal of using the IRS to aid in its immigration crackdown. Long's removal after just two months makes his tenure the shortest in the agency's history.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Jonny Bairstow's spectacular unbeaten 86 from 50 balls was not enough to secure a victory for Welsh Fire against London Spirit. Despite Bairstow's late onslaught, which included back-to-back sixes, Fire fell short by eight runs in their chase of 164. The team's chances were hampered by an early top-order collapse that left them at 55-6, starving Bairstow of the strike for much of the innings. London Spirit's total was anchored by David Warner's unbeaten 70, helping them bounce back from a previous poor performance and leaving both of Welsh Fire's teams winless.</p>
