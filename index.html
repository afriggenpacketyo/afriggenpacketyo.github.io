          <p>Former Senator Richard Burr, now leading a nicotine regulation advocacy group, has accused the Biden administration of failing to stop the influx of illegal e-cigarette products from China. In an exclusive interview, Burr claimed that this lack of enforcement has created a public health crisis, with a majority of vape products on the market being unauthorized and often marketed to minors. The article highlights Burr's call for the Trump administration to reform the FDA's approval process and increase enforcement at the border. A spokesperson for the former FDA official under Biden disputed these claims, citing numerous enforcement actions taken during his tenure.</p>

Winds gusting over 80mph have caused power outages for more than 22,000 properties and led to the cancellation of trains, ferries, and flights. An amber weather warning remains in effect for most of Scotland, with authorities urging caution and warning of a "threat to life." Network Rail Scotland is working to clear debris from tracks, but travel disruption is expected to continue into the next day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk an interim compensation package valued at approximately $29 billion in stock, intended to keep him focused on the company amidst a legal fight over a larger, previously voided pay plan. This new award is contingent on Musk remaining in an executive role for two years, as Tesla pivots towards robotics and artificial intelligence. The move comes after a Delaware judge twice struck down a $55 billion package from 2018, citing unfair influence in the negotiation process. The board stated this interim plan is a "good faith" effort to compensate Musk and will be nullified if the original package is eventually upheld on appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time and prompting a rally in its stock. The company's revenue grew 48% year-over-year, driven by a significant jump in its U.S. government and commercial sectors. CEO Alex Karp highlighted the company's increasing efficiency, aiming for future growth with a smaller workforce. Following the strong performance, Palantir raised its full-year revenue and operating income guidance, signaling confidence in its continued expansion fueled by AI demand and major government contracts.

          <p>Shares of telehealth company Hims & Hers Health dropped significantly after its second-quarter revenue failed to meet Wall Street expectations, despite a 73% increase from the previous year. The company's third-quarter revenue forecast also presented a mixed outlook compared to analyst predictions. This performance comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the company's sale of compounded GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, an issue that recently led to the collapse of a partnership with drugmaker Novo Nordisk. While earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA surpassed estimates, the revenue miss has overshadowed the positive aspects of the report for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state law enforcement to locate and arrest Democratic state representatives who fled to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The lawmakers left Texas to break the required quorum, effectively halting a special legislative session where the GOP aimed to pass new congressional maps heavily favoring their party. In response, the Republican-controlled House voted to issue civil arrest warrants, though their authority does not extend beyond state lines. The Democratic lawmakers, who have traveled to states like New York and Illinois, argue the redistricting effort is an undemocratic attempt to silence minority voters.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced plans to use a controversial Florida facility, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a blueprint for new state-run migrant detention centers across the U.S. The strategy involves establishing facilities near airports in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana to expedite the processing and deportation of unauthorized migrants. Noem claims this model is more cost-effective and efficient than current systems, which rely heavily on private prisons. The approach has drawn criticism and legal challenges over constitutional rights, detention conditions, and the legality of state-run immigration enforcement.</p>

The author highlights Jiménez's 1976 performance of "Un Mojado Sin Licencia" ("A Wetback Without a License"), a song that tells a tragic story with a jaunty, defiant rhythm. The piece argues that Jiménez, a titan of American music who collaborated with stars like the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, used his art to push back against xenophobia. He chose not to wallow in pathos but to celebrate resilience and joy in the face of hardship.</p>

Hammack noted that the Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring this potential price pressure to ensure it doesn't lead to persistent inflation, complicating the central bank's decisions on interest rates.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares dipped after the conglomerate reported a 4% year-over-year decline in second-quarter operating earnings and revealed it had not repurchased any stock in the first half of 2025. The earnings dip was primarily due to a drop in its insurance underwriting business, though other sectors showed profit growth. The company also recorded a significant $3.8 billion loss on its Kraft Heinz investment, a stake Warren Buffett has previously admitted was overpriced. The lack of share buybacks and continued net selling of stocks disappointed some investors, contributing to the decline in share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Eagle's stock price jumped over 23% after President Donald Trump posted a message on social media praising the retailer's new ad campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump called the campaign, which had faced criticism from some for being overly sexualized, the "'HOTTEST' ad out there" and encouraged his followers to support it. The slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans" sparked a cultural debate, but the presidential endorsement appeared to trigger a rally in the company's stock. The event highlights the volatile intersection of marketing, culture wars, and political influence on corporate performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indian government has denounced pressure from the United States over its continued purchase of Russian oil, calling threatened tariff hikes "unjustified and unreasonable." The statement came after President Donald Trump accused New Delhi of profiting from discounted Russian oil and threatened to raise tariffs on Indian goods. India's Foreign Ministry defended its sovereign right to secure its energy needs and accused the U.S. and EU of hypocrisy, pointing to their own continued trade with Russia in other sectors. The dispute adds significant strain to the trade relationship between the U.S. and India, its largest trading partner.</p>

The victims were the parents, grandmother, and uncle of an infant who was found abandoned but alive in a different location. The arrested individuals, Dearrah Sanders, Tanaka Brown, and Giovonte Thomas, are alleged to have assisted Drummond after the murders. Authorities believe the attack was targeted, as Drummond had a relationship with the family, and are offering a reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the choice between fixed and variable annuities for retirement planning in the current economic climate. With interest rates still elevated, fixed annuities offer attractive, guaranteed returns, providing safety and predictability for conservative investors or those near retirement. Conversely, variable annuities offer the potential for higher, market-linked growth that can better hedge against long-term inflation, making them suitable for those with a higher risk tolerance and longer time horizon. The decision depends on an individual's financial goals, risk appetite, and outlook on future interest rate movements and market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A communication expert and author outlines nine common phrases that can undermine a person's authority and credibility at work, offering more powerful alternatives. Phrases like "I think," "Sorry to bother you," and "Does that make sense?" can signal doubt and hesitancy. The article suggests direct and confident swaps, such as replacing "I think" with "I recommend" and asking "Let me know if you'd like me to clarify" instead of seeking validation. The author argues that these small changes in everyday interactions, from emails to meetings, can significantly alter how colleagues perceive one's confidence and competence.</p>

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has made a public appeal for donations of unwanted but healthy pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, to be used as food for its predators. The zoo explains that this practice helps imitate the natural food chain for its carnivores, which include lions, tigers, and Eurasian lynx. According to the zoo, the donated animals are "gently euthanised" by trained staff before being fed to the predators. The policy, which also accepts horses and offers a potential tax break to their owners, is described as a common and sensible practice in Denmark for providing a natural diet.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has demanded that police forces make the immigration status of criminal suspects public at the time they are charged. His call came in response to a case in Warwickshire involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where the two men charged are reported to be Afghan nationals. Farage argued that a lack of transparency fuels online conspiracy theories and public unrest, referencing the aftermath of a deadly attack in Southport last year. Current national police guidance does not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after they have been charged.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of mystery, researchers have identified the cause of a devastating epidemic that has killed billions of sea stars along North America's West Coast. A study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution pinpoints the bacterium Vibrio pectinocida as the culprit behind the sea star wasting disease. The discovery is a major breakthrough for conservation efforts, particularly for the critically endangered sunflower sea star, whose population plummeted by 94%. With the cause identified, scientists can now develop diagnostic tests and focus on breeding disease-resistant sea stars to help restore this keystone species and the kelp forest ecosystems they protect.</p>
