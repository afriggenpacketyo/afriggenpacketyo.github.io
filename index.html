          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The facility, Devastating Pyrotechnics, was found to be operating without local licenses for fireworks storage on the agricultural property. The incident caused a large fire, prompted evacuations, and has drawn in federal investigators from the ATF to assist with the complex and dangerous scene. Families of the missing, including three brothers, are anxiously awaiting news as authorities begin their investigation.</p>

          <p>A year after a significant election win, Keir Starmer's Labour Party is struggling with unfulfilled economic promises and declining public approval. The government's goal to stimulate growth has been hampered by persistent high inflation and borrowing costs, leading to a drop in Starmer's favorability ratings. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces a difficult fiscal situation, with potential tax hikes looming, while the rival Reform UK party gains in the polls. Despite some foreign policy successes, the party must address significant domestic discontent to regain momentum.</p>

          <p>At a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, President Trump celebrated the recent passage of his major tax and spending bill, calling it a birthday present for America. He used the event, officially the start of America's 250th-anniversary celebrations, to criticize opponents and repeat false claims about the previous election. Trump also announced plans for the anniversary, including a UFC fight on the White House lawn, and signaled a policy shift on migrant farm labor. The speech mixed policy promotion with his characteristic divisive rhetoric in front of his supporters.</p>

Despite being a political win for Trump, the legislation is highly controversial, projected to add over $3.4 trillion to the national debt.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant breakthrough by cultivating a heart structure with human cells inside a pig embryo. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, reported that the human-like heart structure continued to beat unaided for 21 days. To achieve this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells to enhance their survival in the pig embryos before implantation. This development follows the same team's previous success in growing human kidneys in pigs, advancing the field of interspecies organ generation for potential transplants.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit aimed at stopping the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Education. The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions, including significant workforce reductions and the termination of grant programs, amount to an unconstitutional and unilateral attempt to abolish the agency. Lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jamie Raskin contend that only Congress has the authority to restructure or eliminate a federal department. The move comes as the administration has paused billions in education funding ahead of the new school year.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the July Fourth holiday weekend, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department has issued warnings for eight local beaches due to high levels of bacteria. Officials are advising the public to avoid swimming, surfing, or any other activities involving water contact at the specified locations, which include areas at Santa Monica Beach, Catalina Island, and Marina Del Rey. The increased bacteria levels are attributed to street runoff, and exposure can lead to illness or skin infections. The warnings will remain in effect until subsequent tests show the water is safe for recreational use.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign visitors while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee hike, with the administration estimating it could generate over $90 million annually. Trump framed the move as part of his "America First" agenda, intended to fund park improvements. The order also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park lotteries or permitting systems and revokes an Obama-era memo promoting diversity.</p>

          <p>Veteran advocates and legal scholars are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of military troops in U.S. cities like Los Angeles erodes democratic norms and harms service members. Critics argue that using federal troops for roles close to civilian law enforcement pushes against the Posse Comitatus Act and puts soldiers in situations they are not trained for. A nonprofit group, the Secure Families Initiative, shared stories of military families facing strain due to these domestic deployments. Speakers at a news conference described the situation as "making America militarized again" and a betrayal of principles service members protect.</p>

According to the Deportation Data Project at UCLA, this contradicts the administration's narrative of focusing on the "worst of the worst" criminals. The report suggests that the recent push for mass arrests has led to more "collateral" detentions of individuals whose only violation is their immigration status. This article provides the case of a pastor who was deported after 30 years in the U.S. despite having no criminal record.</p>
