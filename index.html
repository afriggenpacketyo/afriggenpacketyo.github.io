          <p>Highlighting a thaw in relations, India will again issue tourist visas to Chinese nationals for the first time in five years. The Indian embassy in Beijing announced that applications would resume, requiring an online form and an in-person appointment. China’s foreign ministry welcomed the decision, calling it a "positive move" that serves mutual interests and facilitates people-to-people exchanges between the two nations. This step signals a potential easing of diplomatic tensions that have persisted for several years.</p>

          <p>The UK Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates. The court ruled their trials were unfair, a major vindication for the traders who maintained their actions were common practice and they were scapegoated for the 2008 financial crisis. This judgment raises significant questions about the UK's criminal appeal system, especially since similar convictions in the US were thrown out years ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author, a former late-night writer, reflects on CBS's cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," questioning the network's claim of it being a purely financial decision. The article highlights the timing, coming just after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount for paying Donald Trump and amid a potential merger requiring Trump administration approval. It argues that losing such shows erodes a shared reality and removes a vital platform for holding leaders accountable through humor, which is essential for a healthy democracy.</p>

          <p>As heatwaves intensify, the strategy of "precooling" homes—lowering thermostats during off-peak hours to save energy—is gaining attention, though its effectiveness is debated. Some researchers and utility companies endorse the method, provided the home is well-insulated, while others warn it could lead to excessive energy use and higher costs. Experts agree that consistent temperature settings are generally more efficient than turning AC units on and off. The article also provides alternative energy-saving tips, such as using fans and closing curtains to manage heat.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is implementing stricter security measures on research involving noncitizens, particularly from nations like China, Russia, and Iran. The new directives require disclosure of foreign contracts and have already led to the dismissal of 70 researchers from "countries of concern." While the USDA states this is to secure the agricultural research enterprise, critics and scientists warn the policy could stifle crucial innovation and collaboration. The move impacts university partnerships and hinders progress on global issues like food safety and crop productivity.</p>

          <p>Beijing has announced that the island province of Hainan will operate under an independent customs system by the end of the year, transforming it into a major free-trade port. This move is a key component of China's "dual circulation" strategy, aimed at boosting domestic demand. Under the new regime, thousands of goods will enter Hainan tariff-free, and more relaxed trade regulations will be adopted.

A review revealed the fire resulted from a known fault that National Grid, the substation's owner, had failed to fix since 2018.

          <p>Germany is experiencing a boom in its shadow economy, with undeclared work projected to reach €511 billion in 2025, the highest level in nearly a decade. An expert attributes this surge to a declining "tax morale" among citizens who feel they pay high taxes for deteriorating public services like transportation and infrastructure. The rise is also linked to economic struggles and debates over the country's "Bürgergeld" welfare system, which some argue incentivizes undeclared work. This trend reflects a "tax rebellion of the common man" in response to perceived state failures. (not investment advice)</p>

Archaeologists also found significantly more grave goods with female remains, indicating a higher social status for women.

This includes reforming the incentive structure for local officials, which currently encourages production overconsumption and contributes to industrial overcapacity.

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. Known for his dark, occult-inspired lyrics and eccentric stage persona, Osbourne became a global superstar in the 1970s before being fired from the band due to substance abuse. He then launched a highly successful solo career and later gained a new generation of fans through the reality TV show "The Osbournes." Despite a life of excess and numerous health battles, he remained a beloved and influential figure in rock music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, slightly below economists' expectations. The steady, low inflation rate gives the country's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), flexibility to ease its monetary policy to support economic growth. The MAS has expressed concern about a subdued domestic growth outlook for the second half of the year, citing an uncertain global environment and the potential impact of trade tariffs. The country's export-dependent economy faces headwinds as global consumption is expected to soften. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top German court has finalized the classification of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "suspected right-wing extremist" group. This ruling allows the domestic intelligence agency to continue monitoring the party, including by using undercover informants. The court justified the assessment based on sufficient evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the party, particularly regarding the degradation of German citizens with migration backgrounds. This decision is a significant development in Germany's efforts to contend with the rise of the far-right political party.</p>

          <p>The struggling Los Angeles Dodgers suffered another defeat, losing 10-7 to the Minnesota Twins after a catastrophic bullpen performance. In the sixth and seventh innings, Dodgers relievers issued a series of walks and committed a glaring fielding error, allowing the Twins to score six runs on just two hits. The sloppy play underscored a difficult month for the team, which has now lost 11 of its last 14 games. Manager Dave Roberts described the performance as "a tough watch," acknowledging the team's quality of baseball has been poor.</p>

          <p>Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile, home to 72 tourist gift shops, has become a focal point for concerns about overtourism's impact on local life. Residents claim the dominance of souvenir stores has displaced essential businesses like grocers and butchers, making the area less livable for families. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs, the decline in the local primary school's enrollment and the surge in holiday lets suggest a community under pressure. The city council faces criticism for prioritizing tourism, but pledges to use a future tourist tax for improvements.</p>

          <p>Despite a difficult retail climate in the U.K., a chain of stores called Duck World, which sells only rubber ducks, is managing to stay afloat in prime London locations. The business appeals to tourists, collectors, and millennials, capitalizing on the "treatonomics" trend where consumers buy small, affordable luxuries. While facing challenges like inflation and high operating costs, the co-founder remains optimistic about the iconic appeal of the rubber duck. Retail analysts suggest the niche market and high-profit margins on collectibles contribute to the stores' surprising resilience.</p>

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit in Beijing is set against a backdrop of escalating tensions over trade, technology, and security, with low expectations for major breakthroughs. The relationship is further complicated by U.S. trade policy under President Trump, which creates a complex dynamic for both sides. While the EU and China share an interest in countering some U.S. unilateralism, analysts believe irreconcilable differences will limit cooperation. The extent to which Brussels aligns with Washington on issues like supply chains will be a key indicator of EU-China ties.</p>
