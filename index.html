        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a new congressional map. The proposed redistricting, backed by former President Trump, could create five additional GOP-leaning seats by redrawing districts in major urban areas and South Texas. Democrats accuse Governor Greg Abbott of leveraging disaster relief funds to force the vote, while Republicans defend the move as a fair response to gerrymandering in other states. This is the third time in recent years Texas Democrats have used this tactic to halt GOP legislation.</p>

          <p>According to an Israeli official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is increasingly pushing for a "military solution" to rescue the remaining hostages held by Hamas. This shift in strategy comes amid a perceived lack of interest from Hamas in reaching a diplomatic deal. The news coincides with ongoing protests in Tel Aviv, where families of hostages are demanding their release, citing their deteriorating health. The situation is further complicated by a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with growing international concern over starvation and malnutrition.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced an extra £100 million in funding to intensify efforts against people-smuggling gangs operating in the English Channel. The investment will support the National Crime Agency with up to 300 new officers and advanced technology to disrupt these criminal networks. This comes as the number of small boat crossings reaches a record high for the year. The government also plans to introduce a new criminal offense, with up to five years in prison, for those who advertise illegal crossings online.</p>

          <p>A third child, 10-year-old Ari Buchman, has died from injuries sustained when a summer camp sailboat collided with a barge in Biscayne Bay.

The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the tragic incident, which has devastated the local sailing community.

The concept involves fitting small, side-mounted rocket boosters to drones, enabling them to perform instantaneous, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before impact. According to a research paper, digital simulations showed this system could boost a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent, a significant improvement over current penetration rates observed in conflict zones.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a significant advance in artificial intelligence with Genie 2, a model that can create interactive, 3D game-like worlds from a single static image. The technology allows a user or an AI agent to explore a dynamically generated environment, with the AI imagining and rendering the world on the fly. CEO Demis Hassabis explained that beyond entertainment, the primary goal is to build a "world model" that understands our physical reality. This could be used to train AI agents and robots in a vast array of simulated environments before they operate in the real world.</p>

          <h2>Egg Freezing Gains Popularity as Women Seek to Preserve Fertility Options</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 19:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of egg freezing is rapidly increasing in popularity among American women, who see it as a way to delay motherhood without succumbing to the pressures of the "biological clock." The procedure, which involves harvesting and cryopreserving a woman's eggs, allows them to be used for IVF later in life. While many women find it empowering, bioethicists caution that it is not a guarantee of a future baby and raises concerns about the commercialization of fertility. The high cost, which can exceed $12,000 per cycle, also creates a significant accessibility gap.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Brian Hagedorn, a conservative, has expressed concern about the record-breaking spending in the state's judicial races. He described the more than $100 million spent in the recent election as a "vote of no-confidence" in the court's ability to remain non-political. Hagedorn stated that both sides are pouring money into these races, leading the public to view the court as an extension of politics. He believes it is the court's responsibility to prove its impartiality and earn back public trust, also noting he is inclined to run for re-election.</p>

          <p>In an interview, prominent economist Jeffrey Sachs warned that the United States' confrontational posture towards China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. He characterized the ongoing trade conflict as being initiated by the U.S. and argued that both sides have chokeholds on the other, necessitating a degree of rational cooperation. Sachs also advised that China should focus its export growth on developing markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on the increasingly contentious U.S. and European markets. He sees continued friction but hopes for limits to the competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, prompting the pilot to declare a mayday emergency. The Boeing 787 was ascending when the crew reported the failure of the left engine to air traffic control. The aircraft was immediately guided back to Dulles, where it landed safely approximately two hours after its departure. None of the 219 passengers or 11 crew members were injured, and the airline arranged for alternate travel to their destination.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume thousands of feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the peninsula. Seismologists suggest the events may be linked, theorizing that seismic waves from the powerful quake could have disturbed the magma system of the volcano, which was already primed to erupt. The region is sparsely populated, and no immediate threat to communities has been reported.</p>

Local councilors shared a photo of the rodent, comparing it to the size of a small cat and highlighting it as evidence of a "growing problem" in the area. They stated that this was not an isolated incident and that rats are returning to the community in greater numbers than before. The striking image has gained national attention, which officials hope will spur action to address the infestation issue.</p>
