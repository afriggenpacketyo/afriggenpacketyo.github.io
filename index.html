          <p>During a game against the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox outfielders Wilyer Abreu and Ceddanne Rafaela combined for an impressive 9-8 putout. Abreu leaped for a ball headed over the wall, deflecting it to Rafaela who caught it barehanded. Despite this highlight, the Red Sox lost to the Tigers, who secured a walk-off win, completing a three-game sweep. The article also mentions that the last such play happened in 2003, making this play even more of a rarity, with the article emphasizing the improbability and athletic skill involved in the play.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's request to end birthright citizenship, focusing on whether to limit citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that nationwide injunctions against presidential policies are unfair, but justices questioned the potential chaos of allowing inconsistent enforcement across the country. The justices also debated whether limiting nationwide injunctions could lead to unlawful executive orders remaining in place too long. Sotomayor argued the order violates Supreme Court precedent, highlighting the constitutional implications of Trump's policy.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining steady and lending criteria tightening, many homeowners find their home equity "trapped," meaning it's difficult to access. Elevated interest rates, stricter lending requirements, and job market uncertainty contribute to this issue. Experts recommend exploring alternative home equity borrowing options like HELOCs or home equity loans, improving credit scores, and stabilizing employment history to better access home equity. These strategies can help homeowners leverage their built-in wealth despite the challenging economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown in Slovenia, has disappeared, leading to a police investigation. The statue, a replacement for a previous wooden one destroyed by fire, was reportedly chopped off at the ankles and removed. The statue's creator, Brad Downey, speculates the theft may be related to Donald Trump's new election bid. The disappearance adds another layer to the curious history of the statue, which has become a local landmark.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals a growing shortage of affordable homes for middle-income families in the U.S., with only about 1 in 5 listed homes being affordable for households earning $75,000 annually. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach, particularly in cities with restrictive zoning regulations. The lack of affordable homes is driving up prices, as buyers bid up properties, further excluding middle-income families from the housing market. The article suggests that easing zoning regulations and increasing downpayment assistance could help alleviate the crisis.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unraveled the genetic mystery behind the distinctive orange coloration of ginger cats. Researchers discovered that ginger cats have a missing section of DNA code within the ARHGAP36 gene, which results in lighter pigment production in skin, eye, and fur cells. The study, crowdfunded by cat lovers, could help determine if orange cats are more prone to certain health conditions. The discovery also explains why ginger cats are predominantly male, linking it to the gene's location on the X chromosome.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old former Michigan Army National Guard member, Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, has been charged with plotting a mass shooting at a U.S. military base on behalf of ISIS. Said allegedly provided ammunition and instructions to undercover officers, surveilled the base with a drone, and trained them on firearms and explosives. The planned attack was thwarted before it could occur, and Said faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The case underscores the ongoing threat of domestic terrorism and the vigilance of law enforcement.</p>
