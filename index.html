          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, primarily due to a significant decrease in insurance-underwriting profits. The company also cited a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange fluctuations. Warren Buffett's conglomerate warned that President Trump's tariffs and geopolitical risks are creating an uncertain environment, making it difficult to predict the potential impact on their businesses, which include insurance, transportation, and retail. The article notes that considerable uncertainty remains regarding international trade policies and tariffs, affecting product costs, supply chain efficiency, and customer demand.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a victory for his center-left Labor Party despite trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation called the election for Albanese shortly after polls closed, marking a defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton. The article highlights the impact of global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's trade and diplomatic decisions on Australian voters. The disaffection with major parties, particularly among younger voters, contributed to a record number of independent and minor-party candidates challenging the major parties, raising the possibility of a minority government.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the future visions of tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Sam Altman, arguing that their dreams of Mars colonies and super-intelligent AI are rooted in a far-right libertarian ideology. Musk's Mars colony is portrayed as a vision of total corporate control, while Altman's faith in AI is seen as a belief in technological salvation that renders democracy obsolete. The article suggests that these fantasies offer moral absolution for the tech oligarchs' actions and a sense of meaning, but offer nothing for those living in the real world.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The governing body of Formula One racing is cracking down on drivers using profanity, leading to complaints about inhibited speech. Max Verstappen, a four-time world champion, received a penalty for using an expletive at a press conference, prompting him to express feeling restricted in speaking freely about race penalties. The FIA, under president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, has been issuing point deductions and fines for swearing, causing discontent among drivers. The article humorously questions what drivers are expected to say when cut off at high speeds, suggesting the situation might improve if drivers were on tricycles.</p>

          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not strike a trade deal with the U.S. unless all of President Trump's new tariffs are reviewed. The remarks underscore a disagreement between the two countries regarding which tariffs are negotiable, with the U.S. reluctant to back off from duties on automobiles, steel, and aluminum. Japan is particularly concerned about the 25 percent duties targeting the auto industry. The article also mentions that a 25 percent tariff on certain auto parts has taken effect, further straining relations.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars. The article notes that the tariffs will impact even cars made in the United States, as they often contain components produced abroad. While the administration claims the tariffs will protect national security, automakers and suppliers warn that relocation of assembly lines will take years and will ultimately increase the cost to consumers.</p>
