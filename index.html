            <p>Beijing and northern China experienced severe gales, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the suspension of train lines. Wind gusts reached up to 93 mph, the strongest in the capital in over half a century, prompting an orange alert and urging residents to stay indoors. While numerous vehicles were damaged, no injuries were reported as most residents heeded the authorities' warnings. The strong winds, originating from a cold vortex system over Mongolia, are expected to ease by Sunday, after causing widespread disruption and nervousness among Beijing's 22 million residents.</p>

            <p>Tourism in Los Angeles is facing challenges due to global tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, leading to potential price hikes in souvenir shops and anxieties among business owners. Canadian tourists, angered by Trump's threats, are boycotting American products and canceling travel plans. Local hotels are bracing for price increases on various goods and are worried about businesses canceling conferences. Concerns are rising within the tourism and hospitality industry, which employs about 510,000 Angelenos, as international visitors are crucial to the regional economy.</p>

            <p>Following Stephen A. Smith's consideration of a presidential run, a columnist suggests he should emulate Franklin D. Roosevelt's approach to mass media and policy. The author highlights Roosevelt's "fireside chats" as an example of clear, compassionate communication during times of financial turmoil. The column emphasizes the importance of having well-articulated policies and a deep understanding of issues, rather than relying solely on celebrity and personal attacks. It underscores that governing requires more than a big personality and that politicking is a crucial part of the job.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has placed a check on President Trump's authority to quickly deport individuals alleged to be members of foreign crime gangs, ruling that they are entitled to a hearing before deportation. The court emphasized the constitutional right to due process, ensuring individuals can challenge their removal before a federal judge. This decision, prompted by the deportation of Venezuelans and Salvadorans, is expected to slow the pace of removals, though the administration's compliance remains uncertain. The ruling underscores the importance of fair hearings and legal rights for all persons, including non-citizens.</p>

            <p>Amid tuberculosis outbreaks in the US and abroad, experts argue that increased public health funding could end the disease. Advocates gathered in Washington to urge Congress to increase funding for TB testing, treatment, and prevention. John Green, author and TBFighters creator, emphasizes that eliminating TB is a choice and that recent cuts to public health efforts have set back progress. Advocates highlight that TB disproportionately affects people living in poverty, with HIV, or with unstable housing, and stress that it should have been eliminated decades ago.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences announced they have "de-extincted" the dire wolf by genetically engineering gray wolves with specific gene variants identified from ancient dire wolf DNA. While the company claims the pups resemble dire wolves phenotypically, experts at the La Brea Tar Pits are skeptical, arguing they are genetically engineered gray wolves, not true dire wolves. The debate raises questions about the definition of de-extinction and the use of resources, with some experts advocating for prioritizing conservation efforts for endangered species. The company defends its work, stating de-extinction and conservation can work in tandem and could inspire more people to pursue careers in related fields.</p>

            <p>There was no time to rest. With American companies facing the threat of punishing tariffs from China, Jeff Bowman started selling fast. It was March 31, and the CEO of a company in the US state of Colorado had already watched as US President Donald Trump imposed additional duties on Chinese imports totalling 20 per cent – on their way to a whopping 145 per cent this week. For Bowman, it made more sense to sell it all at once - giving buyers a supply that will last nine to 12 months - before tariffs skyrocketed. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's order to expand timber production in the U.S. will affect all 18 of California's national forests, potentially opening up millions of acres to logging. The directive aims to increase timber production by 25%, citing benefits such as domestic timber supplies, job creation, and wildfire risk reduction. Environmental groups have criticized the order, arguing it will circumvent environmental laws and endanger species. The order highlights tensions between the state and the federal government regarding forest management and environmental regulations.</p>

            <p>New tariffs imposed by China on U.S. exports are raising concerns among American farmers, who fear increased costs and retaliation against U.S. crops. Farmers worry about losing customers, particularly in key markets like Mexico, which may seek alternative sources for corn. While the White House considers mitigation efforts, memories of the damage caused by previous trade disputes linger, especially in the soybean market. Farmers emphasize that they prefer markets over government aid, as subsidies are only a short-term fix and do not address the long-term market losses.</p>

            <p>A new study demonstrates that crows can distinguish geometrically regular shapes from irregular ones, indicating a level of geometric intuition previously thought to be unique to humans. Researchers tested crows' ability to identify outliers in sets of shapes, finding they could discern right angles, parallel lines, and symmetry. This discovery challenges the notion that geometric regularity detection is exclusive to humans and opens new avenues for investigating mathematical abilities in animals. The findings suggest that human geometric abilities may build upon precursor capabilities present in the animal kingdom.</p>

            <p>Ecuador's upcoming presidential election is shaped by rampant drug gang violence and a struggling economy, with voters prioritizing the fight against narco-fueled crime. The election is a rematch between incumbent Daniel Noboa and Luisa González, with the number one issue on voter's minds being combating the narco-fueled violence that has overtaken the country. Noboa has relied heavily on the military and has arrested thousands, González is calling for more technology and coordination along Ecuador's combative coastline and ports. The economy has stalled, limiting resources to combat the rising crime, making the choice of the next president crucial for the country's future.</p>

            <p>A three-year legal battle over the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with health problems, concluded with a jury finding five former corrections officers not liable. Givens' sister sued, alleging the officers beat Givens, leading to his death, while the defense argued he died from a seizure and fall. The case highlighted broader concerns about conditions at the Marion Correctional Treatment Center and raised questions about witness credibility and the burden of proof in prison abuse cases. Despite the verdict, the Virginia Department of Corrections added a camera to the shower room, where the alleged abuse occurred.</p>

            <p>A measles outbreak in western Texas, one of the worst in recent years, has been fueled by vaccine skepticism within the Mennonite community. Despite the deaths of two unvaccinated children, many residents remain hesitant to get vaccinated, influenced by misinformation and distrust of the healthcare system. Public health officials struggle to reach these communities, while some federal figures provide mixed messaging. The outbreak highlights the challenges of combating vaccine hesitancy and the importance of clear, consistent messaging from trusted sources.</p>

            <p>In many ways, it was the usual protest scene. Dozens of striking mental health care workers chanted and marched Tuesday outside a Kaiser Permanente medical center on a busy strip of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Frustrated and feeling unable to get their voices heard after nearly six months of a strike to demand more pay and benefits, these eight therapists were taking their protest to the next level with a five-day hunger strike. The workers began their strike in October, arguing that they deserve the same pension that other Kaiser Permanente workers receive, and pay equivalent to their colleagues in the same therapeutic positions in other parts of the state.</p>

            <p>Panamanian opposition politicians have accused the US of launching a “camouflaged invasion” of the country, amid discontent over the government’s handling of the diplomatic crisis. After a three-day visit by the US defense secretary, Donald Trump appeared to confirm that US military personnel had been deployed to the Central American country. The last US military bases in Panama were vacated in 1999 as a condition of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaties to hand the canal to Panamanian ownership. Under the canal’s neutrality treaty, no foreign power can “maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations within its national territory”, and the US comments have prompted outrage in Panama.</p>
