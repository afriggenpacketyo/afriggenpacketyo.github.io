          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the North Carolina Board of Elections certify the results of the 2024 State Supreme Court race, marking a significant legal win for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers ruled that removing disputed ballots, as sought by Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin, would violate voters' constitutional rights. The ruling, however, has been temporarily stayed for seven days to allow Judge Griffin time to appeal. Justice Riggs declared victory and affirmed her commitment to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. Optimism score of 80 because the ruling was upheld.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. This contradicts Trump's justification for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo's release further undermines the Trump administration's rationale and raises questions about its criticism of news coverage on the issue. The intelligence community based its conclusion on evidence that Venezuelan security forces have arrested Tren de Aragua members and engaged in armed confrontations with them.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has declared a community-wide outbreak of hepatitis A, with cases tripling in 2024 and seven deaths linked to the outbreak.

Dr. Muntu Davis, the L.A.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the Biden administration's earlier stance. The Justice Department argued that the case does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas court where it was filed. The move is surprising given Trump's opposition to abortion rights, but analysts suggest it may be a strategic decision to avoid taking a firm stance on the issue until after the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
