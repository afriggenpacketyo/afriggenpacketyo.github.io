        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to 34 "sanctuary" cities and counties, including major hubs like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. These jurisdictions maintain policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders an unconstitutional "coercive threat," underscoring the potential loss of billions in federal aid. This ruling expands upon a previous order, further challenging the administration's aggressive stance on immigration enforcement. The decision highlights a significant legal conflict over states' rights versus federal authority in immigration matters, as the administration continues to appeal earlier injunctions and pressure these communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a frustrating 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, which caused them to drop their two-game lead and now share the top spot in the National League West. This setback comes after the team had seemingly built momentum with a sweep of the Padres the previous weekend. However, a split series against the Colorado Rockies and Friday's defeat have stalled their progress. Rookie Alex Freeland's solo homer was a bright spot, but the Dodgers' offense largely struggled against strong pitching from Yu Darvish and Blake Snell. Critical missed opportunities, including a double play in the eighth inning, underscored their offensive woes, leaving the team searching for consistency in the stretch run.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez, 57, was denied parole, ensuring his continued incarceration alongside his younger brother Erik, who faced a similar rejection the previous day. While the parole commissioner praised Lyle for his exemplary prison conduct, including leading programs and fostering positive relationships, the panel identified persistent "anti-social personality traits" such as deception, minimization, and rule-breaking, specifically citing illegal cellphone use. The board considered his age at the time of the 1989 murders and the "negative and dysfunctional" home environment. Both brothers, whose life-without-parole sentences were recently reduced to 50 years to life, will be eligible for parole again in three years, though an earlier administrative review is possible. Their family expressed disappointment but remains hopeful for future appeals.</p>

          <p>China's expanding activities in the Arctic have triggered significant concern within the United States, which is closely tracking a fleet of five Chinese icebreakers and research vessels. These ships recently transited the Bering Strait and are now operating in the Arctic Ocean, with at least one vessel reportedly approaching within 290 nautical miles of the Alaskan coast. This proximity is particularly sensitive due to the disputed "extended continental shelf" claimed by the United States in the region. The fleet's presence underscores China's growing strategic and economic interest in the Arctic, a region increasingly accessible due to climate change, leading to heightened geopolitical tensions and a vigilant response from the US coastguard.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is advocating for the mass deportation of asylum seekers arriving in the UK via small boats, with Farage asserting that this radical action is necessary to address a "massive crisis" threatening national security and potentially leading to public disorder. The plan includes withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights, banning small boat arrivals from claiming asylum, and detaining individuals on disused RAF bases for return to their home countries. While Labour dismisses the proposals as unrealistic and the Conservatives accuse Reform of recycling ideas, the party's rising poll numbers reflect public frustration over record-high small boat crossings, pushing immigration to the forefront of the political agenda.</p>

          <p>The Cheetah Lounge, an iconic Atlanta strip club operating for nearly half a century, is scheduled for closure and demolition to make way for a new high-rise apartment building featuring ground-floor retail. Situated on Spring Street in Midtown, this establishment is one of the last vestiges of what was once Atlanta's "red light district," now undergoing significant redevelopment. Georgia Tech has been steadily acquiring properties in the vicinity, and the Cheetah's site was among the final parcels to be sold for new construction. While some local students and city council members view this as a positive move for expanding housing options, patrons and the approximately 300 employees lament the loss of jobs and a long-standing cultural fixture. The project is anticipated to conclude by 2029.</p>

This initiative, spearheaded by state Democrats, aims to create new districts that could potentially add five Democratic seats to Congress, directly countering similar efforts by Texas Republicans and former President Trump. Charles Munger Jr., a prominent GOP donor and advocate for independent redistricting, has contributed $10 million to the "No on Prop. 50" campaign, arguing against partisan manipulation. Conversely, the "Yes on 50" campaign, backed by labor groups and Democratic PACs, asserts it's a vital response to prevent Republicans from rigging the 2026 midterms.

Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares blasted the "idiocy" of the sign, while Democratic state Senator Ghazala Hashmi criticized its evocation of "Jim Crow-era ugliness." The incident underscores the intense and often fraught nature of debates surrounding transgender rights, revealing how quickly such discussions can devolve into harmful and bigoted rhetoric.

Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capabilities give it a significant advantage in integrating into global supply chains.

The victim, a shipbuilder from Prichard, Alabama, has not yet been publicly named.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has released over 300 pages of transcripts from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The interview, conducted while Maxwell serves a 20-year sentence, was not a cooperation deal but offered her immunity for her statements. Maxwell discussed her relationships with Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump, and Bill Clinton, denying ever witnessing inappropriate behavior from Trump or recruiting anyone from Mar-a-Lago for Epstein. She also cast doubt on Epstein's prison suicide and refuted the existence of a "client list." The release aims to provide transparency amid public pressure and ongoing investigations into the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at the home and office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton in Bethesda, Maryland, and Washington D.C., respectively. The bureau confirmed the "court authorized activity" is partly related to a classified documents investigation. President Trump, who called Bolton a "lowlife" and "unpatriotic," claimed he learned of the raid from TV and expected a briefing from the Justice Department. This action follows Bolton's critical 2020 memoir and previous attempts by the Trump administration to block its publication and sue him for profits, alleging disclosure of classified information. The search reignites scrutiny over the handling of classified materials and the politicization of legal processes.</p>

          <p>A notable political divergence is emerging in the UK, with polling data suggesting young women are increasingly left-leaning, while young men are more inclined towards the right. A 2025 survey found 20% of young British women identified as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with women showing stronger support for Labour and the Green Party, and men for Reform UK. Researchers attribute this "gender generation gap" partly to more women pursuing higher education, where liberal attitudes are prevalent, and the influence of social media. Experts also suggest young men may be clinging to traditional masculinity, while women seek a progressive future, contributing to this widening political chasm.</p>

          <p>The recently released transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview offered only partial relief for Donald Trump, who has been under continuous pressure regarding his past associations with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell's testimony generally aligned with Trump's narrative, as she denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior from him or recalling a "bawdy" birthday note reportedly sent by Trump. However, the transcripts, which also extensively questioned her about Bill Clinton, did not fully quell the "Maga" uproar or satisfy those who suspect a broader conspiracy involving powerful elites in Epstein's crimes. Maxwell's perceived sense of "aggrieved entitlement" and the continued political scrutiny surrounding Epstein's death highlight the persistent public demand for greater transparency and accountability in this high-profile and deeply disturbing case.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses an earlier Pentagon stance that troops would not carry weapons during the deployment, which now numbers approximately 2,000. While the administration claims the mission has brought "total safety" to D.C. and considers expanding it to Chicago, Mayor Muriel Bowser and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have raised concerns about federal intervention and its potential to inflame tensions. The move is deeply unpopular with many D.C. residents, and Trump is considering declaring a national emergency to extend the deployment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro vowing to pursue charges for every arrest. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers alone are poor indicators of public safety, as they don't always lead to convictions or reflect actual crime rates. They note that "flooding the zone" with officers can increase arrests for minor infractions, potentially violating rights. The lack of transparency regarding who was arrested and by which agency further complicates assessment. Experts warn that increased police-public interaction can lead to more uses of force and create a "pressure cooker environment," despite the administration's claims of improved safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive crime crackdown in Washington D.C., including clearing homeless encampments, is drawing comparisons to San Francisco's controversial approach to homelessness. Following a Supreme Court ruling allowing penalties for sleeping rough, San Francisco, under Governor Gavin Newsom and former Mayor London Breed, ramped up citations and arrests. While businesses credit the policy for reducing visible encampments, critics argue it merely cycles people through the system without solving underlying issues like mental health, addiction, and housing shortages. This comparison highlights a national debate on criminalizing homelessness versus providing supportive services, with D.C. now facing similar questions about the effectiveness and humanitarian impact of such strategies.</p>

This surge, accompanied by $120 million in short liquidations, saw ether-focused companies like Bitmine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming jump significantly.
