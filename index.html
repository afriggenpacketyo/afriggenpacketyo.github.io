          <p>San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa will miss the rest of the season after suffering a torn ACL in his right knee during a game against the Arizona Cardinals. The 2022 NFL Defensive Player of the Year was injured in the first quarter, dealing a significant blow to the undefeated team's defense. Bosa, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, is a crucial part of the 49ers' roster, and his absence will be a major challenge for the team moving forward. Veteran Bryce Huff is expected to take over his starting position.</p>

          <p>The Sacramento District Attorney has indicated that the recent shooting at the ABC10 station may have been politically motivated, citing circumstantial evidence. The suspect, a former lobbyist, allegedly targeted the station following the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show. Investigators discovered handwritten notes at the suspect's home expressing animosity towards Trump administration officials and mentioning Jeffrey Epstein. These findings are being used to build a case suggesting the crime was driven by political grievances.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a stop-work order against an offshore wind farm being developed by Danish company Orsted. The Revolution Wind project, located off the coast of New England and nearly complete, can now resume construction. The judge ruled that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit, which argued the administration's order was unlawful and arbitrary. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani has canceled his appearance at a WABC town hall to protest the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani stated his withdrawal is a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over the freedom of the press in the face of government pressure. He framed the issue as part of a broader trend of authoritarianism that threatens free speech for all Americans, not just prominent television hosts. The move highlights the growing political fallout from the network's decision.</p>

          <p>The White House has dismissed media reports alleging that border tsar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bribe during an FBI sting operation. A spokesperson denied the accusations, calling the operation a politically motivated attempt by the Biden Justice Department to entrap and discredit a vocal Trump supporter. Officials asserted that Homan never took the money and that an investigation ordered by the current FBI Director found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing.</p>

This move is being pursued despite the fact that current federal law does not have a mechanism for formally labeling U.S.-based organizations as domestic terrorist groups.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive analysis of 25 previously published studies has found that interventions designed to reduce political hostility have only small, temporary effects. Researchers discovered that any modest increase in warmth felt towards political opponents largely evaporated within two weeks. The study suggests that individual-level approaches are not a "magical fix" for deep partisan divides. Lasting change will likely require addressing the systemic incentives that encourage political and media figures to fuel and profit from conflict.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, has rested his case after presenting a brief defense in which he is representing himself. Routh called only three witnesses, including a former Marine sniper to discuss the rifle found at the scene, and two friends to testify to his non-violent character. He ultimately chose not to take the stand in his own defense, and the trial will now proceed to closing arguments.</p>

OpenAI's Sam Altman echoed the need to bring the smartest people to the country, suggesting the new policy could be seen as a way to streamline the process through financial incentives.</p>

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation at Castlehill Care Home in Inverness has exposed severe and systemic failures in care, leading to accusations of "neglect" and "cruelty" from residents' families.

The report also highlighted chronic staff shortages that resulted in inadequate and improper care, including male carers attending to female residents against their families' explicit wishes.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has officially become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Constellation Brands' Modelo Especial. This shift in the market represents a significant comeback for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years prior following a controversy. Modelo's declining sales are linked to several challenges for Constellation, including tariffs on aluminum and Mexican imports, as well as weakening demand from its core base of Hispanic consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Trump administration has announced the cancellation of its long-standing annual food insecurity survey, labeling it "redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous." For 30 years, the report has provided crucial data on hunger in America, shaping policy and aid programs. Anti-hunger advocates have condemned the decision, arguing that it will leave policymakers "flying blind" and unable to measure the scale of the problem, particularly after recent changes that tightened SNAP eligibility.</p>
