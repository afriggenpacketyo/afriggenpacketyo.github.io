        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has publicly refuted claims from Chinese state-affiliated media that its H20 AI chips represent a national security threat to China. The accusations suggested the chips contain a hardware "backdoor" allowing for remote deactivation, which Nvidia has strongly denied, stating cybersecurity is critically important and no such backdoors exist. This exchange highlights escalating tech tensions between the U.S. and China, as Washington's export controls aim to prevent Beijing from using advanced chips for military purposes. Nvidia developed the less-advanced H20 chip specifically for the Chinese market to comply with these restrictions, navigating a complex political and economic landscape.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Rondale Moore suffered what his coach described as a "pretty significant" knee injury during a punt return in a preseason game against the Houston Texans. The injury is particularly devastating as it occurred on his first play after missing the entire 2024 season with a separate knee injury. Moore, who has a history of injuries throughout his career, was carted off the field in an emotional scene. The incident casts doubt on his availability for the upcoming season and adds pressure to the Vikings' receiving corps.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man in Austria narrowly avoided tragedy after clinging to the outside of a high-speed train when it departed a station without him during his cigarette break. The incident occurred in Sankt Poelten, west of Vienna, as the train headed for the capital. The man reportedly jumped into the space between two carriages and banged on windows to alert passengers and crew. The conductor performed an emergency stop, allowing the man to be brought aboard safely, though he was later met by police. A railway spokesperson condemned the act as highly irresponsible, emphasizing that such behavior usually results in death.</p>

          <p>Supporters of the Sheffield Wednesday football club have organized widespread protests calling for owner Dejphon Chansiri to sell the team. Fans displayed banners and organized demonstrations, including an empty away end for the first five minutes of a match, to voice their discontent. The protests stem from the club's financial turmoil, which includes a points deduction in 2020, a transfer embargo, late payments to players and staff, and the closure of a stadium stand due to structural concerns. The situation has become so dire that a supporters' trust has established a fund to help financially stricken staff and is making contingency plans for a phoenix club should the current one collapse.</p>

Whitlock was a crucial creative force behind the band's iconic 1970 album, "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs," co-writing half of its tracks, including "Bell Bottom Blues." His soulful musicianship was honed at Stax Records and with the rock-soul group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, where he collaborated with legends like George Harrison. After the Dominos disbanded, Whitlock continued as a prolific solo artist and session musician, leaving a significant mark on rock and blues music.</p>

          <p>A coalition of top European leaders, including the heads of France, Germany, Poland, the UK, and the European Commission, has publicly urged that Ukraine must be directly involved in any peace negotiations concerning its war with Russia. While they welcomed President Trump's diplomatic efforts to "stop the killing," they issued a joint statement asserting that a path to peace cannot be determined without Ukraine's participation. The statement followed a meeting between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and European officials. It also emphasized the need for robust security guarantees to ensure Ukraine can defend its territory in the future.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified Patrick Joseph White as the gunman who opened fire at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying at the scene. According to a law enforcement official, the 30-year-old suspect had become fixated on his belief that the COVID-19 vaccine had caused him personal health issues, including depression. White first attempted to enter the CDC campus but was stopped by guards, after which he moved to a nearby building and began shooting. The incident has prompted a CDC workers' union to demand that federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, stating it endangers the lives of scientists.</p>

          <p>A violent attack at a nightclub in Santa Lucía, a rural area in Ecuador's coastal province of Guayas, has left eight people dead and three injured. According to police, heavily armed assailants arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles before opening fire on the patrons. This massacre is the latest in a wave of extreme violence sweeping the nation, which authorities attribute to turf wars between organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels. Ecuador has experienced a dramatic increase in homicides, with over 4,000 recorded in the first five months of 2025, prompting a state of emergency in its most dangerous provinces.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers continue to suffer from preventable heat-related illnesses and deaths. Advocates and some lawmakers argue that the system is failing due to ineffective enforcement by the state's occupational safety agency, Cal/OSHA. A recent state audit criticized the agency for insufficient staffing and outdated procedures. The problem is compounded by the fact that many agricultural workers are undocumented and fear retaliation if they complain about unsafe conditions, especially amid intensified immigration enforcement. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, these vulnerable workers face ever-increasing risks.</p>

However, after three patient deaths were linked to the company's treatments, the FDA has asked Sarepta to suspend distribution, causing its stock to plummet.

          <p>Severe weather and heavy rainfall across the Midwest have led to widespread flash flooding, forcing the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair. The fairgrounds in a Milwaukee suburb were inundated after some areas received up to 10 inches of rain. The flooding also prompted the cancellation of a triathlon, caused power outages for nearly 47,000 customers, and led to numerous water rescues by the Milwaukee Fire Department. Flood watches and warnings remain in effect for several Midwest states as forecasters predict more heavy rain and potentially severe storms.</p>

          <h2>Conservative Pundit Charlie Kirk Criticizes Trump's Potential Marijuana Reclassification</h2>

          <p>Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has publicly voiced his opposition to reports that President Donald Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. On social media, Kirk expressed concern that such a move would make it harder to protect public spaces for children, complaining that "everything already smells like weed." The potential change would move marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, easing some federal restrictions and providing tax benefits to cannabis companies. The push for reclassification continues a process initiated during the previous administration.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London supporting the recently banned group Palestine Action resulted in 532 arrests, marking one of the largest single-day arrest totals by the Metropolitan Police in a decade. The majority of arrests were for displaying placards supporting the group, which the UK government proscribed as a terrorist organization in July. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of people defy the ban in Parliament Square. The mass arrests have sparked debate, with Amnesty International criticizing the UK's broad terrorism laws as a threat to free expression, while the Home Secretary defended the ban based on security advice.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to discuss a path toward ending the war in Ukraine, a summit driven by Trump's push for a peace deal. The meeting comes after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face more sanctions. While Trump is willing to include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the summit is currently bilateral at Putin's request, raising concerns from Kyiv about decisions being made without its input. A potential deal reportedly involves territorial swaps, with Russia keeping Crimea and the Donbas region, an idea Zelensky has firmly rejected.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who passed away at age 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 Oscar-winning film "Apollo 13," praised him as a leader who dared to venture to places others would not. The film depicted the harrowing 1970 mission where an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft, forcing the crew to abort their moon landing and execute a perilous journey back to Earth. In his tribute, Hanks celebrated Lovell's courage and dedication, noting his voyages were fueled by challenge, not a desire for fame.</p>
