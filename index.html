          <p>Representative John Rose was granted access to documents related to the 2023 Covenant School shooting in Nashville, praising the FBI for their transparency under Director Kash Patel. The documents, including writings by the shooter Audrey Hale, offer insight into the tragedy. Rose contrasts this with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department's lack of responsiveness to his inquiries. Concerns about inspiring copycat violence have led to some redactions, but Rose believes the information should be made public to better understand the crime and inform policy decisions.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, a major hub for manufacturing components for vehicles headed to the United States. Union officials fear the city could become a "ghost town" without the auto-parts makers. Many of these companies are small businesses lacking the financial stability of larger automakers to withstand the 25% tariffs on imported autos and parts. The tariffs are threatening Canada's vital auto industry, which was originally created to avoid Canadian tariffs on U.S. autos. Relevant context: The auto industry in Windsor is deeply intertwined with families, and the tariffs have already led to layoffs.</p>

This move is intended to offer a competitive edge to businesses looking to offer rapid delivery. Relevant context: Amazon dominates the e-commerce landscape with its Prime service.</p>

          <p>The European Union has scaled back its economic growth forecast for 2025 by nearly half a percent due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The European Commission expects the GDP of the 20 countries using the euro to grow by just 0.9 percent in 2025, down from the previously forecast 1.3 percent. Germany's economy is expected to stagnate, with exports declining. The commission noted that de-escalating tensions between Europe and the United States could lead to stronger growth.

Malcolm X's views evolved over time, particularly after his pilgrimage to Mecca, leading him to seek alliances among oppressed people of color. Despite facing threats and ultimately assassination, his legacy continues to inspire movements for Black identity and political action.

Moody's cited the tax cut legislation along with broader concerns about the fiscal deficit and growing debt costs. The U.S. credit rating downgrade and worries about debt and deficits could further upset financial markets if they begin to shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds. Anxious investors also pushed up the price of gold, long a refuge during times of market stress.

          <p>Christine Emba argues that the mainstreaming of pornography has had a negative impact on modern society, particularly on Gen Z, who have grown up with unlimited access to it. She cites the rise of violent, extreme pornography and its potential connection to harmful behaviors and young women’s distrust in young men. She critiques the reluctance, especially in progressive circles, to publicly admit disapproval of porn, despite evidence of its warping effect on culture and consumers. The author suggests that society is allowing its desires to be molded in experimental ways by an industry that does not have our best interests at heart.

          <p>Following a temporary truce in the trade war between China and the United States, tensions have resurfaced with the US imposing a ban on Chinese firm Huawei Technologies’ Ascend AI chips. Beijing accused Washington of "maliciously blockading and suppressing Chinese chip products and the AI industry without justification." Analysts suggest that President Trump is expanding the battleground beyond tariffs and tightening tech restrictions on China. China is actively countering US restrictions with its own export controls and self-reliance measures.

The two victims of the crash were identified on Sunday by Mexican officials. Relevant context: The accident occurred after the ship left Pier 17 in Manhattan, just below the Brooklyn Bridge.
