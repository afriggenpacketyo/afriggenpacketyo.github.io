          <p>The U.S. State Department has effectively barred Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas from traveling to New York for the upcoming UN General Assembly by denying or revoking visas for him and about 80 other Palestinian officials. The decision comes as several U.S. allies plan to formally recognize Palestinian statehood at the UN gathering. The State Department cited the Palestinian Authority's failure to renounce extremism as the reason, while Abbas's office called the move a violation of the UN headquarters agreement, which requires the U.S. to permit access for foreign diplomats.</p>

          <p>The International Red Cross has stated that Israel's plans for a mass evacuation of Gaza City cannot be executed safely under current conditions. President Mirjana Spoljaric warned that such an order would trigger a massive population movement that the Gaza Strip cannot absorb due to widespread infrastructure destruction and extreme shortages of essentials like food, water, and medical care. The organization highlighted that many residents, including the sick, injured, and starving, would be physically unable to comply with the evacuation orders, leading to a catastrophic humanitarian situation.</p>

The Iran-backed Houthi movement confirmed the deaths, stating the attack occurred during a routine meeting. The Israeli military acknowledged conducting a precise strike on a Houthi military target in the area. This event marks a significant escalation in the regional conflict, as the Houthis have been launching attacks against Israel in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly demanded a transfer to Newcastle United, accusing his current club of breaking promises and "unduly standing in his way." In a social media statement, Wissa claimed he had written assurances that he could leave if a reasonable offer was made, but Brentford has since increased their asking price from £40m to around £65m.

          <p>Thousands of people have attended "March for Australia" anti-immigration rallies in Sydney, Melbourne, and other cities, prompting condemnation from the government over links to the far-right. The protests, which saw some clashes with counter-demonstrators, were promoted by opposition politicians and neo-Nazi figures. Demonstrators cited concerns over mass migration eroding national unity, as well as its impact on housing, infrastructure, and crime. The Australian government denounced the rallies, with ministers stating that racism and ethnocentrism have no place in modern Australia and that they stand against those seeking to divide society.</p>

          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the increasing adoption of home air conditioning is sparking a debate about its environmental, financial, and health implications. While air conditioning provides relief and improves productivity, environmental groups express concern over the potent greenhouse gases, specifically hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), used as refrigerants. Experts also note that while poorly maintained units can spread viruses, clean systems can improve air quality. The article explores the paradox of air conditioning: it can be a life-saving necessity in a warming world, yet its current technology contributes to the underlying problem of climate change.</p>

          <p>In their first meeting in seven years, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pledged to foster a relationship of partnership rather than rivalry. Meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, both leaders emphasized deepening trust and managing their long-running border dispute. Modi announced that direct flights between the two nations, suspended since 2020 clashes, would resume.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed the first death from whooping cough in the UK this year, involving a baby whose mother was not vaccinated during her pregnancy. This event highlights growing concerns about declining vaccination rates, with key childhood immunization targets not being met. Health officials stress that maternal vaccination is vital for protecting newborns before they are old enough to receive their own shots at eight weeks. The death serves as a tragic reminder of the serious danger the bacterial infection poses to very young infants.</p>

          <p>This article examines the increasing normalization of autocratic behavior within the American political system under the Trump administration. It cites examples such as fawning cabinet meetings, the criminalization of political opposition, calls for the arrest of critics, and the use of federal agencies against rivals. Observers and political scientists draw parallels to authoritarian regimes abroad, noting a systematic effort to control government bureaucracy, the legal system, and civil society. The piece questions whether these developments are a recent shift or an acceleration of pre-existing vulnerabilities in American democracy.</p>

          <p>This article from NPR examines the significant financial barriers facing Millennials and Generation Z in the United States. Having come of age during periods of economic uncertainty, many younger Americans struggle with concerns about job security and housing affordability, with home and rental prices far outpacing wage growth. Research indicates this demographic is less likely to believe in the American dream, and the median age of a first-time homebuyer has risen to 38. The article is part of a series investigating how these affordability concerns are shaping the lives and political views of Americans under 40.</p>

This move is the latest in President Trump's campaign against wind power, which he has long criticized as expensive and harmful to wildlife.

          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the complex undersea topography around the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea could be used to create a "submarine kill zone." The research focuses on so-called "acoustic shadow zones," areas near submerged mountains where sound waves are distorted, making it difficult for sonar to detect objects. Scientists propose that these zones are ideal locations for deploying intelligent sea mines, which could hide from enemy detection and selectively target vessels. This development could enhance China's underwater warfare capabilities in the contested region.</p>

          <p>A global craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, has led to supply shortages and record-high prices. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, jumped 170% at a recent auction in Kyoto. This surge is straining Japan's aging farming communities, and many retailers are now rationing supplies. In response, major companies like Ito En are creating dedicated matcha divisions and raising prices to cope with the intense competition for raw materials and the labor-intensive production process.</p>

Offensively, new UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a difficult debut, and the running game was largely ineffective. The lopsided loss raises early concerns for the team under coach DeShaun Foster, representing a significant step back after a promising finish to the previous season.</p>

          <p>A nationwide manhunt is underway in Germany for Marla-Svenja Liebich, a neo-Nazi activist convicted of incitement and defamation, who failed to report to prison to begin an 18-month sentence. An arrest warrant was issued after Liebich did not surrender to a women's jail in Chemnitz. The case has drawn criticism of authorities and sparked controversy over Germany's new self-identification law, which Liebich used to legally change gender before requesting to be placed in a women's facility. Liebich appeared to mock the situation in a social media post about disappearing.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking a decade since former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society, politics, and culture. While data shows significant progress in integration, with nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave employed by 2022, challenges remain, including a higher unemployment rate for migrants. The anniversary has reignited national debate, with the current conservative chancellor, Friedrich Merz, distancing himself from Merkel's optimistic stance and emphasizing the need to control immigration.</p>

          <p>Five people were arrested after masked men attempted to enter the Crowne Plaza hotel in West Drayton, which is currently housing asylum seekers. The Metropolitan Police reported that the group damaged security fences during the incident on Saturday. The event was part of wider demonstrations by anti-asylum groups, with around 500 people marching in the area, leading to a significant police response. Officers enforced cordons to prevent a breach of the peace, and a dispersal order was put in place to manage the disorder.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment near the California-Oregon border, biologists are using drones to haze gray wolves away from livestock. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices to scare the predators. This creative, nonlethal method is part of an effort to find new ways to promote coexistence between ranchers and the recovering wolf population. While the technology is expensive and its long-term effectiveness is still uncertain, initial results have shown success in interrupting wolf hunts.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, India and China are showing signs of repairing their strained economic and political relationship. The recent imposition of 50% tariffs on Indian goods by the Trump administration over India's Russian oil purchases has created a new incentive for New Delhi to engage with Beijing. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit is seen as a potential turning point, as both nations seek to navigate a challenging global economic landscape and reduce their dependence on Western markets.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1 in a game marked by uncharacteristic errors and a lack of offensive support for pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow pitched effectively, taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but the team's defense committed two errors and its offense went 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position. A key moment came when a potential run was negated by a runner being thrown out at the plate. The loss, combined with a Padres win, shrinks the Dodgers' lead in the NL West to just one game.</p>

Sun predicts that transaction volume facilitated by Tron, which is expected to reach $8 trillion this year, will exceed that of Swift within the next five years. He highlighted Tron's ability to process transactions in seconds compared to Swift's days-long settlement times. This confidence is based on Tron's growing dominance in the global stablecoin market, which facilitates rapid, low-cost cross-border payments.</p>

          <p>Protesters have taken to the streets in cities across Mexico to demand government action and justice for the more than 130,000 people who have been reported as missing. Relatives of the disappeared, many of whom have formed search parties called "buscadores," marched with placards bearing the faces of their loved ones. The vast majority of these disappearances have occurred since the country's "war on drugs" began in 2007, with drug cartels and organized crime groups being the primary perpetrators. The widespread demonstrations highlight a national crisis that the United Nations has called a "human tragedy of enormous proportions."</p>
