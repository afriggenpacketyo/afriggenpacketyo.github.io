          <p>Two Baldwin Park police officers were hospitalized after a shooting incident on Saturday night near Filhurst Avenue and Los Angeles Street. Responding to reports of a shooting, officers engaged with a suspect, resulting in both officers being wounded and the suspect being shot as well. The officers were transported to LA General Hospital, while the suspect was taken to a separate hospital for treatment; the conditions of all three individuals remain unknown. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies have taken a suspect into custody, and the scene remained active with numerous officers, including SWAT personnel, conducting an investigation. Optimism regarding the recovery of the officers and a thorough investigation is tempered by the seriousness of the incident.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a sharp rise in obesity, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, with experts linking this trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation and the consumption of processed foods contribute to the problem, particularly among children. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but it faces criticism for overlooking economic struggles and the inaccessibility of healthy foods for low-income households. Experts advocate for a nationwide free school meal program and better regulation of unhealthy food production.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's (FA) ban on transgender women playing in women's football has commenced, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining a woman based on biological sex. This ruling prevents transgender women registered with the FA from playing in FA-affiliated women's football at all levels. One player, Billie Sky, can no longer play for her team despite helping them earn promotion, but will continue to play informally for a club that withdrew from FA leagues in response to the policy. While some grassroots footballers support the ban to protect the integrity of women's football, the FA acknowledges the issues around the policy as a "complex subject."</p>

Imprisonment is no longer divided into with and without labor, and prison work is not mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education. The revised law stipulates imprisonment consists of "confinement in a penal institution," and inmates can be assigned "necessary work" or undergo "necessary guidance" for rehabilitation. The new system sets up 24 programs tailored to an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for elderly inmates and drug abusers.</p>

The two main candidates have been silent on gender equality, a topic that helped Yoon into power in 2022 by appealing to men who felt marginalized. A third candidate, popular among young men for his anti-feminist stance, symbolizes a new fight for many young South Korean women. These women express frustration that their voices are not being heard and fear that their efforts to improve the world have been undermined.</p>
