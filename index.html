            <p>Following the implementation of net total tariffs of 104% on Chinese imports into the U.S., China's foreign ministry has declared it will take "resolute and forceful" measures to safeguard its interests. The ministry emphasized the need for equality and mutual respect in trade negotiations. China asserts it fulfilled its obligations under the "Phase 1" trade agreement, while accusing the U.S. of violating mandates, claims which the White House has not yet addressed. The escalation of tariffs has raised concerns about volatility in financial markets and inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has denounced calls for denuclearization as a "daydream," insisting that North Korea will never abandon its nuclear weapons program. This statement comes in response to a meeting between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan, where they reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearization. Tensions in the region are heightened as Kim Jong Un continues to develop nuclear capabilities and align with Russia. Kim's foreign policy priority is now Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and troops to help prolong its warfighting in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Facing crushing tariffs from the U.S., some Chinese exporters are abandoning shipments mid-voyage to avoid the costs. This drastic measure, dubbed "preparing for the Long March," reflects the severe impact of the new tariffs on cross-Pacific trade. One company reported a significant drop in US-bound container volume and has halted shipping plans from multiple countries. One client had told the company it was abandoning goods already on the water and giving them to the shipping company, as “no one will buy them after the tariffs are imposed”.

            <p>A full-scale trade war between China and the US is increasingly likely after President Trump imposed tariffs of more than 100% on Chinese goods imports. China has vowed to "fight to the end" rather than capitulate to what it sees as US coercion. The US tariffs on China have been one of the main contributors to the decline in the market value of Apple in recent weeks, with its share price falling by 20% over the past month. Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, has suggested this week that the US could apply pressure on other countries, including Cambodia, Mexico and Vietnam, not to trade with China if they want to continue to exporting to the US.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect, hitting South East Asia particularly hard. Vietnam and Cambodia face some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49% respectively. This poses a major challenge to these export-dependent economies. Unlike China, governments in South East Asia are attempting to negotiate rather than retaliate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. has blocked thousands of Chinese scientists from accessing the SEER cancer database. This move is part of new U.S. science policies targeting China amidst ongoing trade tensions. The SEER database provides nationwide data on cancer incidence, survival rates, and treatments. The ban extends to institutions in Russia, Iran, and North Korea, as well as China. A researcher at Shanghai’s prestigious Fudan University, who asked not to be identified, said the ban was “a very serious scientific event”.</p>

About 40% of the teachers surveyed also said they felt ill-equipped to handle such conduct.

Beacon Hill Academy has a "zero tolerance" approach to derogatory language and emphasizes parental control over children's online activities.</p>

            <p>The BBC has investigated the major cocaine route to Europe, which is growing. Seventy percent of the world's cocaine now flows through Ecuador's ports. This is smuggled into the country from neighbouring Colombia and Peru – the world's two largest producers of cocaine. The consequences are deadly: January 2025 saw 781 murders, making it the deadliest month in recent years. Ordinary workers, not just gang members, get caught in this supply chain.</p>
