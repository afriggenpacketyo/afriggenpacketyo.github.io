          <p>Knowing whether a financial advisor is a fiduciary is crucial for trustworthy financial advice. Fiduciaries are legally bound to act in their client's best interest, unlike those following a 'suitability' standard. Failing to work with a fiduciary can lead to higher fees and misaligned investments, costing clients tens of thousands of dollars over time. Investors can use the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure site or organizations like the CFP Board to find fiduciaries and ensure their advice is not driven by hidden commissions.

          <p>Luxury fashion brands are increasingly integrating Labubu dolls into their marketing strategies, leveraging the collectible toys' popularity among celebrities and younger, digitally savvy consumers. These blind box toys, while inexpensive, command high resale values and are now featured in high-end collaborations, such as Moynat handbags and A-Morir's crystal-encrusted versions. This trend allows luxury brands to generate hype and attract new audiences by tapping into the emotional value and virality of 'cute' characters, offering a fresh angle in a market seeking unique identity reflections.

          <p>The UK Home Secretary has ordered an urgent review into the substantial costs of taxi services for transferring asylum seekers to appointments, following a BBC investigation. Some asylum seekers reportedly undertake journeys costing hundreds of pounds, including a 250-mile trip to a GP. Despite issuing bus passes for weekly return journeys, taxis are booked for other necessary travel, with public transport often not presented as an option. Critics from across the political spectrum have condemned the expenditure as a waste of taxpayer money, highlighting broader issues within the asylum system, including cramped hotel conditions and illegal working.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised President Donald Trump's apparent pivot on the Russia-Ukraine war, following a 'productive meeting' at the UN General Assembly. Trump stated on social media that Ukraine, with EU and NATO support, could 'fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,' departing from his previous skepticism about Kyiv's ability to liberate occupied territories. While Kyiv expressed cautious optimism, acknowledging Trump's changeable stance, the shift was seen as a significant development. This change in rhetoric could signal potential shifts in US policy regarding military aid and territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, an all-girls camp in Texas, plans to partially reopen next summer, a year after catastrophic floods killed 27 campers and counselors. The portion of the camp along the Guadalupe River that was destroyed will remain closed, but an undamaged section will welcome campers. The announcement follows new state safety laws prompted by the tragedy, which mandate stricter flood zone regulations and emergency plans for camps. Some families of victims have criticized the reopening, expressing ongoing grief and concerns about the camp's past safety measures, while others appreciate the memorial plans.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the European Union's increasingly aggressive approach towards China is akin to 'tilting at windmills,' causing self-inflicted economic and social damage. Despite concerns about its trade deficit, the EU refuses to ratify the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), which would expand exports, due to sanctions over human rights allegations. This confrontational stance is also seen as hindering the EU's energy transition by obstructing the adoption of cost-effective Chinese clean energy technologies. The article suggests that Brussels' actions contradict its stated economic goals and may be misdirected.</p>

          <p>Mexico has detected a new case of New World screwworm in cattle in Nuevo Leon, the closest instance to the U.S. border since the outbreak began last year. This parasitic larva, which affects warm-blooded animals including humans, has prompted Mexico to activate emergency controls. The U.S. had previously suspended imports of live Mexican cattle due to the outbreak, a ban that remains in place. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association expressed extreme concern, emphasizing the urgent threat to America's cattle producers and the potential for significant economic losses for Mexico's ranching federation.</p>

Initiatives like NeMo propose energy-efficient autonomous cabs and convoys for rural areas, with commercial rollout expected by 2026.

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs faces a new lawsuit from his former stylist, Deonte Nash, alleging sexual assault, violence, human trafficking, and false imprisonment during his ten-year employment. Nash, who previously testified against Combs in a federal trial, claims he endured 'forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults.' The lawsuit details incidents including Combs allegedly strangling Nash and forcibly searching his home. Nash seeks compensatory and punitive damages, stating he found the courage to act after the criminal trial. Combs was found guilty of prostitution-related charges but acquitted of racketeering and sex trafficking in July.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has strongly refuted President Donald Trump's assertion at the UN General Assembly that London had 'changed' and now desired 'Sharia law.' Khan labeled Trump as 'racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic,' suggesting his comments stemmed from Khan's identity as a Muslim mayor of a liberal, multicultural city. UK cabinet minister Pat McFadden also defended Khan, affirming that only British law applies in the UK. This incident marks another escalation in the long-standing public feud between Trump and Khan, with the mayor highlighting London's cultural success despite the president's criticism.</p>

          <p>While the Philippines has seen a decrease in journalist killings and an improved press freedom ranking under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., rights groups warn of persistent intimidation and politically motivated prosecutions. Despite Marcos Jr.'s promises of a critical press, five journalists have been killed since he took office, and accountability for assailants remains elusive. High-profile cases like journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, detained for over four years on 'trumped-up charges,' highlight ongoing concerns.

The defense raised concerns about the reliability and circumstances of the 1972 statements, citing a lack of opportunity to cross-examine. Relatives of the Bloody Sunday victims welcomed the decision, while veterans expressed disappointment, underscoring the contentious nature of the ongoing legal proceedings.</p>

Opinion polls suggest the opposition ANO party, led by Andrej Babis, holds a significant lead, promising higher living standards and challenging the EU's Green Deal.

In minimum-security prisons, lack of empathy from staff, insufficient access to sanitary supplies, and the absence of privacy make basic personal care a public indignity. Women are often forced to use inadequate amounts of soap and limited underwear, leading to stained garments and public shaming. The author suggests a simple solution: changing the color of state-issued underwear to dark brown or black, which would help restore a sense of dignity to incarcerated women.</p>
