          <p>Greg Rosen, the former head of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section, has resigned, citing President Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters as a "terrible message." Rosen believes these pardons signal that political violence is acceptable in a democratic society, which he considers antithetical to a constitutional republic. He oversaw a large team of attorneys handling criminal cases related to the Capitol riot and noted the Justice Department's high conviction rate in these trials, attributing it to overwhelming evidence. Rosen is now joining a private law firm, expressing a desire to assist clients facing government scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Republican senators, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, are resisting President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to concerns about its impact on the national debt, which is nearing $37 trillion. These fiscal hawks are pushing for deeper spending cuts than those included in the House-passed bill, potentially complicating its passage in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow margin. The bill aims to reduce outlays by $1.5 trillion over ten years but is projected to add about $3.1 trillion to the debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The White House, however, claims the legislation will save $1.6 trillion over the same period, disputing the CBO's analysis (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Amid escalating attacks between Ukraine and Russia, the Trump administration has adopted a more subdued approach to mediating the conflict. President Trump has not publicly reacted to Ukraine's drone strikes inside Russia, even as negotiations between the two countries continue. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated Trump's call for direct talks, the administration's involvement and expectations for progress have diminished. The United States expressed disappointment with Russia's demands for a 30-day truce, viewing them as unrealistic and a delaying tactic. Meanwhile, attacks from both sides have intensified, with Ukraine claiming significant damage to Russia's strategic bomber fleet.</p>

          <p>A geomagnetic storm, predicted to produce vibrant displays of the northern lights across many U.S. states, was weaker than initially forecast. While solar activity is currently at its maximum phase in an 11-year cycle, leading to more frequent and widespread aurora sightings, this particular storm did not deliver the expected intensity. Auroras are typically visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere. Space weather experts note that the sun's active period is expected to continue through the end of the year, suggesting more opportunities for aurora sightings may arise.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is facing a primary challenge from her own Lieutenant Governor, Anthonio Delgado, as she seeks re-election in 2026. Delgado announced his bid, citing a need for "bold, decisive, transformational leadership" and claiming that "people are hurting and New York deserves better leadership." Despite their past working relationship, friction between Hochul and Delgado has grown in recent years. Recent polling indicates that a majority of New Yorkers would prefer someone else as governor in 2026, although Hochul currently holds a lead over Delgado and other potential Democratic challengers in a hypothetical primary matchup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election saw extremely low voter turnout, with nearly 90% of eligible voters abstaining. This has fueled concerns about the legitimacy of the election, which President Claudia Sheinbaum had championed as a key component of the country's transformation. Experts attribute the low participation to factors such as the election being held in an off-year, a complex balloting process, and the obscurity of the candidates. Despite the disappointing turnout, it is expected that the pro-Morena judges will take their seats, potentially leading to a further concentration of power in the presidency.</p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her remarks about potential Medicaid cuts.

Scholten criticized Ernst's leadership in light of these comments, stating that Iowa needs better representation. Scholten has previously run for higher office and currently pitches for the Sioux City Explorers.

          <p>A recent study indicates that measles vaccination rates in children have declined in most U.S. counties since before the COVID-19 pandemic. The study, analyzing data from 33 states, found that the MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year. This decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with the majority of reported cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals.

It highlights an incident involving the detention of an aide to Representative Jerry Nadler and the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka during an inspection of a DHS facility. The article argues that the executive branch has pursued a multi-pronged attack on Congress's independence, including pressure from law enforcement and attempts to seize power over regulatory agencies.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes financing will be straightforward if commercial offtakers are secured, suggesting countries looking to reduce trade deficits with the U.S. could invest. However, energy analysts are skeptical, citing the project's lack of clear commercial logic.

While the team involved in the plot has been imprisoned, the financier resides in Moscow, visiting the headquarters of the Russian secret police.

          <p>Despite a turnout of less than 13%, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum described the country's judicial election as "extraordinary." The election, intended to be a key component of the ruling party's transformation, saw significantly lower participation than anticipated. Experts attribute the low turnout to factors including its being an off-year election and the convoluted nature of the balloting process. Critics have seized on the low turnout to mock the ruling party's electoral prowess, but experts believe the election will still reinforce the party's power and give President Sheinbaum more control over the government.</p>
