          <p>Welsh snooker legend Mark Williams has made history by becoming the oldest winner of a ranking tournament at 50 years and 206 days old. He secured this record by defeating Shaun Murphy 10-3 in the Xi'an Grand Prix final, surpassing the previous record held by Ray Reardon since 1982. This victory marks Williams' 27th career ranking title, placing him sixth on the all-time list, and makes him the only player to have won tour events in five different decades, spanning his teens through his 50s.

          <p>Reports indicate that Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has left the nation following weeks of escalating public unrest and massive youth-led demonstrations calling for his resignation. His departure is said to have occurred after he lost crucial support from a key faction within the military, significantly weakening his hold on power. The political situation remains fluid as the country grapples with this sudden leadership vacuum. This development follows a period of growing discontent with his administration's policies and governance, which has fueled the widespread protests across the island nation.</p>

          <p>Share prices for U.S.-based rare earth mineral companies saw a significant jump in value following President Trump's threats of retaliatory tariffs against China over its export controls. Companies like USA Rare Earth and Critical Metals experienced double-digit percentage increases as investors reacted to the escalating trade dispute. The situation highlights America's strategic vulnerability and reliance on foreign sources for these critical minerals, which are essential for defense, technology, and electric vehicle manufacturing. In response, the Defense Department is accelerating efforts to stockpile these materials, and major financial institutions are pledging investments to bolster national security-related industries.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has accused Democratic leaders of "hostage-taking" in the ongoing government shutdown, which has entered its third week without a clear resolution. Vance stated that the administration will not negotiate over what he frames as an ultimatum regarding health insurance tax credits, a key Democratic demand for reopening the government. The political impasse continues with both parties blaming each other, while federal agencies have begun issuing layoff notices to thousands of workers. Democrats, in turn, argue that Republicans are boycotting negotiations to avoid addressing critical issues and are creating chaos.</p>

          <p>Arsenal will be without their captain, Martin Odegaard, until after the upcoming international break due to a knee injury sustained earlier this month. The 26-year-old midfielder suffered a medial collateral ligament injury during a match against West Ham on October 4th. This setback means he is expected to miss several key fixtures for the club, including four Premier League games and two crucial Champions League matches.

          <p>The current government shutdown is having a direct impact on the United States military, as all active-duty service members are required to continue performing their duties without receiving their paychecks. While a 2019 law ensures they will eventually receive back pay once the shutdown ends, the immediate financial strain is a significant concern. Civilian defense employees deemed "essential" will also continue to work unpaid, while others are furloughed. Financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering no-interest loans to affected service members, a measure also taken during previous shutdowns to mitigate the financial hardship.</p>

          <p>While the majority of the mortgage market is expected to operate normally during the government shutdown, applicants seeking government-backed loans could face processing delays. Agencies like the FHA and VA will continue to approve and guarantee loans, but worker furloughs may slow down the process. However, the USDA will halt the issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans entirely. Another potential issue is the National Flood Insurance Program, administered by FEMA, which cannot sell new or renewal policies during a shutdown, potentially complicating closings for homes in high-risk flood zones.</p>

          <p>A short government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact air travel, but a prolonged one could lead to major disruptions for passengers. Most TSA officers and air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay, but extended financial pressure could lead to increased sick calls and staffing shortages. This scenario, which occurred during the 2018-2019 shutdown, resulted in longer security lines and flight delays at major airports. The U.S. Travel Association warns a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring of new air traffic controllers, exacerbating an existing shortage.</p>

While congressional staffers' paychecks will be delayed until funding is restored, the lawmakers themselves are exempt from the financial disruption affecting other parts of the federal government.

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become more frequent over the past four decades. Before 1980, agencies often continued operating during funding gaps, but legal opinions from that era established that they lacked the authority to do so. President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns, while the longest in history was a 34-day partial shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019 under President Trump. These events, often stemming from intense partisan disagreements over policy and spending, have repeatedly led to furloughs for federal workers and disruptions to government services across the country.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass the necessary appropriations bills to fund federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1. This forces all non-essential government functions to cease until a funding agreement is reached, as federal law prohibits spending without congressional authorization. Essential employees, such as military personnel and air traffic controllers, must continue to work but do not receive pay until the shutdown ends. Programs with permanent funding, like Social Security and Medicare, continue to issue payments, but administrative services can be delayed due to staff furloughs, affecting the public in various ways.</p>

His strategy aims to resonate with voters frustrated with the political establishment by emphasizing an economic divide rather than a partisan one.

The service would involve Citi holding native cryptocurrencies, providing a regulated alternative to other forms of crypto custody for institutional investors.</p>

          <p>A German woman has anonymously returned the top of an ancient limestone column that she stole from the archaeological site of Olympia in Greece more than 50 years ago. The artifact, a nine-inch-high column capital, was taken from the Leonidaion, a 4th-century BC guesthouse. Motivated by recent repatriations of other antiquities, she handed it over to the University of Muenster, which facilitated its return to Greece. The Greek culture ministry praised the woman's "sensitivity and courage," highlighting the act as proof that it is never too late to do the right thing.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, John Moore, has been jailed for more than six years after admitting to the manslaughter of his drug dealer, Francis Reilly. The altercation occurred when the 63-year-old Reilly came to Moore's home in Brentwood, Essex, to collect an unpaid debt and sprayed ammonia in his face. Moore retaliated, striking Reilly with a hammer and pushing him against a wall, which resulted in catastrophic chest injuries and 20 broken ribs that led to his death. Moore initially claimed self-defense during a murder trial but later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.</p>

          <h2>College Tuition Discounting Becomes Common Practice Amid Soaring Sticker Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 08:12:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the advertised cost of college attendance approaches six figures at some institutions, a "high-tuition, high-aid" model has become prevalent, involving significant "behind-the-scenes" discounting. According to author Ron Lieber, the average tuition discount for new full-time students at private colleges is now around 56%, primarily through merit aid. This means that very few families actually pay the full sticker price, with the net price being a more accurate reflection of the cost. However, the lack of transparency in how aid is calculated leaves many families struggling to predict the true expense of higher education.</p>
