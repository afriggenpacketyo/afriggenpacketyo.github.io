          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" following a U.S. military strike on a submarine in the Caribbean, which President Trump claimed was carrying drugs. Petro stated the vessel was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure, and he is demanding an explanation from the U.S. government. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly U.S. strikes in the region, which the U.S. defends as necessary to stop drug trafficking but which UN experts have called "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>Despite significant summer spending, Liverpool's performance has dipped, with a recent string of losses highlighting the tactical impact of Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid. This article analyzes how the team now struggles to bypass high-pressing opponents and build up play from the back, missing Alexander-Arnold's exceptional passing range and ability to use his weaker foot. This has forced tactical compromises, such as using new signing Florian Wirtz in a deeper role, which may not maximize his attacking potential.</p>

Research from institutions like Yale and the New York Fed suggests that AI has not yet caused significant widespread job losses, and that many firms are using it to retrain existing employees rather than replace them.

          <p>It is common for sexual desire to wane in long-term relationships, a phenomenon driven by hormonal changes where bonding hormones like oxytocin can dampen sex drive. According to psychologists, open communication about sexual needs and preferences is crucial for couples to navigate this natural shift. Research also highlights that female sexuality can be complex, with a potential disconnect between physical and psychological arousal, and that relationship satisfaction is strongly linked to ensuring both partners' sexual needs are met.</p>
