        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several local councils in the UK are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, despite a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction in Epping. The court found the initial injunction was flawed, partly because it risked encouraging more protests. Epping Forest District Council is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court, while other councils, supported by political figures like Kemi Badenoch, maintain that using hotels strains local services and breaches planning laws. This ongoing legal and political conflict highlights the tension between national asylum policy and local governance, as the government aims to phase out hotel use amid rising asylum applications.</p>

          <p>Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, a fervent University of Michigan supporter, made his debut on Fox's 'Big Noon Kickoff' ahead of a major game between Ohio State and Texas. Portnoy humorously leaned into a manufactured controversy where he claimed to be banned from Ohio Stadium by coach Ryan Day due to his allegiance to Michigan. He appeared on camera in a disguise, including a fake mustache and an 'I Love Ryan Day' hat, playfully escalating the rivalry. Ohio State officials had clarified that he wasn't banned but simply wasn't part of the main desk crew permitted inside the stadium for the broadcast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal emergency economic laws, dealing a significant blow to his trade strategy. The court affirmed that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant unlimited power to levy tariffs, which it described as a core congressional power. While the ruling doesn't immediately block the tariffs, it directs a lower court to reevaluate the universal injunction. The Trump administration has vowed to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing it undermines the president's role in foreign policy and harms the country's economic standing.

          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor, who continues to write books and give presentations, attributes his sharp memory to five daily practices. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress and depression, which can contribute to memory loss. He also advocates for lifelong learning by reading widely outside one's expertise, using an organizational system like color-coded notes, and engaging in daily physical activity to increase blood flow to the brain. Finally, he stresses maintaining a healthy diet, proper hydration, and getting at least seven hours of sleep each night to support overall cognitive function and brain health.</p>

They traveled over 9,000 miles non-stop from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance from South America to Australia. Throughout their journey, they faced numerous challenges, including severe storms and injuries, while successfully raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, 'The Anthropocene Illusion,' examines the distorted and artificial ways humans interact with the natural world as we increasingly alter it. Nelson traveled for six years across 14 countries, capturing images that reveal the curated and often deceptive versions of nature presented in zoos, theme parks, and tourist experiences. His work highlights the paradox of destroying natural habitats while simultaneously creating hyper-managed facsimiles to satisfy a craving for connection. The project serves as a commentary on our sense of loss and an unwitting monument to the very nature we are losing, aiming to spark a reassessment of what society values.</p>

          <p>A growing trend, amplified by social media, sees brides purchasing numerous outfits for a series of wedding-related events, from engagement parties to bachelorette trips and post-wedding brunches. Experts note that what was once a single-day affair has evolved into a multi-event season, with the average bride now buying around 12 different looks. One bride reported spending nearly $18,000 on 15 outfits to ensure a unique look for every photographed moment. This shift is driven by a desire to match the increasing extravagance of weddings and the pop culture pressure to create Instagram-ready celebrations, leading retailers to expand their 'little white dress' collections.</p>

        </div>

          <p>This opinion article questions why it took Western institutions and media nearly two years to acknowledge the possibility of genocide in Gaza, despite early and consistent testimony from Palestinians. The author argues that Palestinian lives are systematically dehumanized, making their suffering and death seem less credible to the outside world, a necessary component of a colonial project. The piece critiques the media's framing of the conflict, which often starts with the events of October 7, 2023, without the broader context of decades of occupation. The author asserts that the recent shift in discourse is not a moral awakening but a calculated response to forms of suffering, like starvation, that are more palatable for Western audiences to process.</p>

The analysis considered factors like financial aid, academic quality, and post-graduation earnings. Despite high tuition, students at top-ranked schools like Princeton, Caltech, and MIT often pay a lower average net price due to generous financial aid and go on to earn high median incomes a decade after attendance. Many of these elite institutions have 'no-loan' policies or cover full tuition for families below certain income thresholds, significantly boosting their value proposition.

A mandatory 24% federal withholding is taken immediately, with winners likely owing more at tax time due to being in the top 37% tax bracket.

          <p>A pastor diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, a rare and serious condition that caused his heart to become 'hard like cement,' survived a major cardiac arrest thanks to the CPR training his family had received from his doctor. After collapsing while wrapping Christmas presents, he spent weeks unconscious and on life support before undergoing successful heart and kidney transplants. AL amyloidosis involves abnormal proteins accumulating on organs, and is often diagnosed late. Eighteen months after his transplants, the pastor has made a remarkable recovery, returning to his pulpit and even participating in a 5K run with the hospital staff who saved his life.</p>

          <p>The perception of Indian food in the U.S. is shifting dramatically from 'cheap food and curry houses' to sophisticated, upscale dining experiences, with restaurants earning Michelin stars and attracting celebrity clientele. Chefs like Vikas Khanna are moving beyond stereotypical menus to explore hyper-regional Indian cuisines, leading to immense popularity and nightly waitlists of over a thousand people at establishments like Bungalow in New York. This trend is driven by younger consumers' interest in global flavors and a growing, affluent Indian American population. As a result, investor interest is surging, with private equity firms now backing Indian restaurant chains looking to expand in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement agencies are increasingly concerned about far-right extremist groups looking to emulate the use of drones in modern warfare for domestic terrorist attacks. Online chatter among these groups frequently discusses how cheap, first-person viewer (FPV) drones could be weaponized for a potential civil war against the government. Experts note that extremists are learning from the use of drones by drug cartels and terrorist organizations like ISIS. Evidence has emerged of military-trained neo-Nazis identifying FPV drones as a valuable tool for reconnaissance and attacks on critical infrastructure, posing a significant challenge for counter-terrorism officials.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Executive Order on Flag Burning May Inadvertently Strengthen Legal Defense for Protesters</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order directing federal officials to prosecute flag-burning whenever possible, calling the act 'uniquely offensive.' However, this move is unlikely to change the legal landscape, as the Supreme Court has twice ruled that flag-burning is protected speech under the First Amendment. Legal experts suggest the order is largely symbolic and may even backfire by providing defendants with a 'selective prosecution' defense. By explicitly stating a desire to prosecute based on the message conveyed, the order could make it easier for individuals charged under content-neutral public burning laws to argue they were unfairly targeted for their political expression.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the University of California system should sue the Trump administration over the illegal suspension of hundreds of millions in federal research funds, rather than negotiate a settlement. The author, a co-counsel in a successful lawsuit brought by researchers against the administration, points out that federal courts have already found the funding cuts to be unlawful and a violation of the 1st Amendment. Capitulating to what is described as 'extortion' would set a dangerous precedent, betray university values, and potentially force the UC system to eliminate diversity programs and gender-affirming care as part of a deal, harming its students and faculty.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the recent shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, which marked the first of the new school year. The author laments the repetitive cycle of tragedy, grief, and inaction that follows such events in America. Quoting the school's principal, Matthew DeBoer, the article emphasizes an African proverb: 'When you pray, move your feet.' It calls for concrete actions to prevent future violence rather than relying solely on words and prayers. The piece argues that genuine hope for the future can only be found when the community and its leaders translate their sorrow into meaningful change to protect children.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Guardian has revealed links between several major sportswear brands and forced labor programs involving ethnic minorities from China's Xinjiang region. Chinese brands Anta, Li-Ning, and 361 Degrees, which sponsor numerous NBA stars, have been connected to factories participating in the state-run labor transfer scheme. The report also presents evidence linking Nike to a manufacturer in Fujian province that has used transferred workers from Xinjiang. This raises serious questions about the supply chains of global brands and the NBA's commercial ties to a market where such human rights abuses are prevalent.</p>

          <p>Two major new studies have found that beta-blockers, a standard treatment for heart attack patients for decades, provide no benefit for the majority of individuals and may increase the risk of death and hospitalization for certain women. The research showed that for patients with normal heart function after a heart attack, the drug offered no advantages. For women with preserved heart function, beta-blocker use was linked to a significantly higher risk of another heart attack, heart failure, and death. These groundbreaking findings are expected to reshape international treatment guidelines, prompting a more sex-specific approach to cardiovascular care.</p>

          <p>Author Dan Wang argues that a key difference between China and the U.S. is that China is an 'engineering state' while America is a 'lawyerly society,' explaining their vastly different speeds of development. China's leadership, often composed of trained engineers, approaches societal problems with a technical, project-oriented mindset, resulting in rapid infrastructure growth like high-speed rail and massive bridges. In contrast, America's legalistic culture, while protecting pluralism, often leads to paralysis, gridlock, and endless procedures that stifle large-scale construction. Wang suggests that while China's approach can be brutal, as seen in the one-child policy, it offers lessons in achieving material abundance that the U.S. struggles to match.</p>

The rise of trendy alternatives like matcha, offered by newer competitors like Blank Street Coffee, is capturing a key demographic that legacy brands are failing to attract. Analysts suggest that a combination of changing health trends, cost of living pressures, and the growing popularity of artisanal shops is putting pressure on established players. With reports that owner Coca-Cola may sell the chain, Costa faces the challenge of reimagining its brand to appeal to a market that now seeks unique, experience-driven beverages over standard coffee offerings.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is pushing an ambitious 'autumn of reform' package aimed at overhauling the welfare state and boosting the economy, but he faces significant resistance from his coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party (SPD). With Germany facing economic stagnation and a massive budget hole, Merz's plans to cut welfare while reforming taxes create a dilemma between pleasing his conservative base and maintaining coalition stability. The SPD, which favors taxing the wealthy, holds effective veto power, forcing the combative chancellor into a position of compromise that could dilute his agenda and disappoint voters from both parties.

Decades of research on programs like Social Security and food stamps consistently show that giving money to people in poverty is the most direct and effective way to reduce poverty.

The arrest also appears to violate Department of Homeland Security policies that prohibit immigration enforcement during emergency responses.

This practice affects long-term residents like Luis Fernandez, who has been in the U.S. for decades, and is seen by legal experts as a punitive measure designed to make the immigration process unbearable.
