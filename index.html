          <p>Paul Doyle, a 53-year-old father of three and former Royal Marine, has been charged following a crash during Liverpool's Premier League victory parade that injured 79 people, including a nine-year-old child. Doyle faces multiple charges, including causing grievous bodily harm with intent, dangerous driving, and unlawful wounding with intent. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims stated that seven people remain hospitalized, and detectives are reviewing CCTV and mobile phone footage. Chief Crown Prosecutor Sarah Hammond emphasized that the charges will be kept under review to ensure justice for every victim, and the investigation is ongoing. Optimism is somewhat tempered by the severity of the injuries and the legal proceedings ahead.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, suggests that financial sanctions could become a new point of contention in the rivalry between China and the United States. Lian warns that Washington might initially target specific Chinese entities before gradually expanding sanctions to potentially exclude China from the US dollar system. While acknowledging the difficulty of implementing full-scale financial sanctions, Lian emphasizes the potential for such measures to disrupt the Swift system and encourage the use of China's alternative, CIPS. This analysis underscores the growing concerns about the financial dimensions of the ongoing tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the United States in exchange for eased tariff measures, according to a minister's statement ahead of bilateral trade talks. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters, with equipment purchases based on national security needs. This stance contrasts with earlier suggestions that defense purchases could help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in tariff discussions. Japan's focus remains on strengthening its defense capabilities independently of trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The global business travel sector is experiencing a significant drop in optimism due to the ongoing trade war, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. Positive sentiment has more than halved, with many companies anticipating reduced employee trips and spending. Concerns about rising business travel costs and visa processing problems are contributing to the uncertainty. However, some regions may benefit from the shift as companies consider relocating events from the U.S. to other countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs is being challenged in court, potentially limiting his ability to use them as an economic weapon. A lower court initially ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, but an appeals court temporarily stayed that ruling. The administration argues that a loss in court would cripple the president's ability to negotiate trade deals. Trump has frequently used tariffs to influence trade negotiations, but the legal challenges could force him to seek congressional approval for future measures.</p>
