          <p>Mondelez International, the snack giant behind many name-brand treats, is suing Aldi, claiming the grocery chain is intentionally mimicking its packaging to mislead customers. The lawsuit alleges that Aldi's look-alike products are designed to confuse shoppers into purchasing the cheaper alternatives. This legal action highlights the ongoing battle between name-brand companies and discount retailers over product imitation. Mondelez seeks to protect its brand identity and prevent Aldi from profiting from its established reputation, arguing that the similar packaging deceives consumers.</p>

          <p>Presenter and campaigner Katie Piper spoke at the Hay Festival about her experiences with ageing and societal expectations, drawing parallels between ageing and bereavement.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. This directive came after the New England Journal of Medicine published an article by VA pulmonologists warning about the impact of staff reductions on veterans' healthcare. Critics argue that this policy is an attempt to censor scientific findings and restrict freedom of speech, potentially harming veterans by limiting the dissemination of important medical information. The VA maintains that the policy is a standard coordination procedure, but concerns persist about political interference in scientific research.</p>

          <p>Three massive wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for weeks. Firefighters have made significant progress, and all evacuations were lifted on Memorial Day. The fires have covered about 30,000 acres, with the U.S. Forest Service believing the Jenkins Creek Fire was "human caused." Interactive maps are available to track the spread of the fires, and donations are being accepted to support relief efforts for affected communities.</p>
