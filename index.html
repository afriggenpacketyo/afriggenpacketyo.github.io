          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served nearly 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. The evidence, found in semen samples from the crime scene, pointed to an unknown attacker. Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history. Merseyside Police has reopened the investigation into Sindall's murder, with ongoing efforts to identify the DNA profile, which does not match any family members or the victim's fiancé at the time.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden underwent evaluation after doctors discovered a small nodule on his prostate during a routine physical exam. Further testing is needed to determine if the nodule is cancerous or benign. Prostate cancer is common among men, with age being the most significant risk factor. The news comes as a new book about Biden's health during his time at the White House is set to be released.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's military stated that 51 people were killed by Indian strikes, including 40 civilians and 11 armed forces members, marking a revision from previous reports. These strikes were launched in response to an attack on Hindu tourists in India-administered Kashmir. Following tit-for-tat exchanges, a US-brokered ceasefire has largely held, with senior military officials from both countries communicating to ensure implementation. Despite this, Indian Prime Minister Modi warned of retaliation if further terror attacks occur.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar by invoking golfer Sam Snead's motto: "When they give you a putt, you say, 'Thank you very much.'" He compared turning down the plane to a golfer foolishly insisting on taking a gimme putt, then missing it. This analogy reveals Trump's view of ethical concerns as opportunities to be seized, similar to his response to accusations of tax avoidance.

Five domestic businesses argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the sweeping duties.
