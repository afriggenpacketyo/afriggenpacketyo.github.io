          <p>In Farmersville, Illinois, a first date between Leslie Reeves and Chris Smith turned deadly on Thanksgiving Day 2021. Reeves was found murdered, shot in the head, while Smith was barely conscious with a gunshot wound to the head; he survived but with significant impairments. Investigators suspected Reeves' ex-boyfriend, Bobby Tarr, who initially denied involvement but later placed himself at the crime scene and was found to be lying about his alibi. Tarr was eventually convicted of first-degree murder and attempted murder, with the case highlighting the dangers of domestic violence and the importance of seeking help in abusive relationships.</p>
