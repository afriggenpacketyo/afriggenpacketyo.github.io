The BBC, which broadcast the set, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service.

          <p>President Donald Trump's significant spending and reform bill has passed a key procedural vote in the Senate, moving forward on a 51-49 party-line vote. The legislation, which President Trump has dubbed a "big, beautiful bill," now faces a lengthy debate period, which Democrats plan to extend by forcing a full reading of the 940-page document. Republican supporters, like Senator Ron Johnson, view the bill as a necessary step toward fiscal sustainability, while Democrats, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have condemned it as a radical proposal rushed through without public scrutiny. President Trump praised the vote as a "great victory" for his agenda.</p>

Securing a majority for his ruling coalition is a primary goal, though he acknowledged it will be challenging amidst voter concerns over inflation and economic uncertainty. A recent Kyodo News poll indicated that half of respondents do not want the ruling camp to maintain its majority.

          <p>According to sources, China is planning to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a military parade in September commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This event would mark the first in-person meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping since Trump's return to office. The invitation comes as the U.S. has proposed a visit by Xi during the same month. The potential joint celebration, which Russian President Vladimir Putin is also expected to attend, could present a complex diplomatic situation for Japan and other global powers amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

The narrative details her struggle to navigate a life-threatening illness while caught in a legal and bureaucratic battle over the administration's attempts to dismantle the CFPB. Despite being reinstated by a court order, she and her colleagues face a crippled agency and an uncertain future.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled but stated the government is now in a "better position" to pass the reforms. Key concessions include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, narrowly avoiding a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision that directly impacts legal challenges to President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the decision allows the administration to begin implementing its policy in the 28 states that have not filed lawsuits. Legal battles will continue on the merits of the case, as challengers argue the order violates the 14th Amendment.

          <p>The Trump administration is repurposing civil rights laws, particularly Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to investigate and pressure universities over issues like DEI programs and campus antisemitism. This strategy mirrors the aggressive enforcement of Title IX under the Obama administration, which critics argued led to illiberal excesses and threats to academic freedom. This article argues that both Democratic and Republican administrations have weaponized the civil rights enforcement apparatus to target parts of civil society hostile to their agendas.

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay reflects broader economic pressures on consumers, particularly younger generations. Economic commentator Kyla Scanlon suggests that the trend is a symptom of a "poor-impulse-control economy," where stagnant wages, high living costs, and the normalization of debt make these services attractive. While BNPL offers an interest-free way to manage purchases, it also encourages spending and can lead to accumulating debt.

Dorsey, who has predicted Bitcoin's price could reach $1 million by 2030, emphasized the importance of the update on social media. He has consistently argued that Bitcoin needs to evolve from a simple store of value into a practical tool for everyday transactions to ensure its long-term relevance. (not investment advice)</p>

Freeman was previously advised by a government watchdog not to lobby on behalf of the company due to his former role as science minister. While Freeman stated he does not believe he did anything wrong, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for his suspension during the investigation.</p>

The author argues against succumbing to immobilization, advocating instead for channeling rage and sorrow into constructive action and community building. Citing examples from activists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and former congresswoman Cori Bush, the piece emphasizes that resistance is found in mutual care and local organizing. The author concludes that humanity and connection are powerful forms of resistance that fascists cannot take away.</p>

          <p>A veteran music teacher at a Catholic school in the New Orleans area was fired after a parent discovered his late husband's obituary, which identified him as a man. Mark Richards, who taught at St. Francis Xavier school for 21 years, was dismissed for violating a morality clause in his contract that prohibits employees from being in a same-sex marriage. The firing has sparked outrage in the school community, with a petition supporting Richards gaining over 1,500 signatures. The incident highlights ongoing tensions between Catholic doctrine and LGBTQ+ rights within the archdiocese, which is also navigating bankruptcy due to clergy sexual abuse claims.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning of an "explosive increase" in the population of lone star ticks, which can cause a severe red meat allergy known as alpha-gal syndrome. Aided by rising temperatures from the climate crisis, these aggressive ticks are expanding their range from the southeastern U.S. into northern and western states. Cases of alpha-gal syndrome have surged from a few dozen in 2009 to potentially 450,000 today. Researchers predict the tick's range could eventually cover the entire eastern half of the U.S., putting millions more at risk of developing the life-altering allergy to mammalian products.</p>

          <p>Airlines dim cabin lights during takeoff and landing primarily as a critical safety measure, not to conserve energy. According to a pilot and a flight attendant, this procedure allows passengers' and crew's eyes to pre-adjust to darkness. This is crucial in the event of an emergency evacuation, particularly if there's a power failure, as it significantly reduces the time needed for eyes to adapt to low-light conditions. Dimming the lights also makes it easier to see emergency floor path lighting and to spot potential hazards outside the aircraft, such as fire or debris, during the most critical phases of a flight.</p>
