          <p>China's consumer price index was unchanged in July from the previous year, defying market expectations of a slight decline and suggesting persistent weak demand in its economy. This stability, coupled with ongoing deflation in producer prices, indicates continued economic headwinds amidst trade turbulence. Officials noted that policies to boost domestic demand showed some positive results with a month-over-month price increase. However, the data reveals a mixed picture, with falling food prices contrasting with rising costs for services and other goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing, Nagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki issued a stark warning about a potential "existential crisis" facing humanity due to global confrontation and fragmentation. The ceremony included a moment of silence and the ringing of twin bells from Urakami Cathedral, one of which was restored after being lost in the 1945 attack. While Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to uphold Japan's non-nuclear principles, he did not address the country's refusal to sign the UN's nuclear weapon prohibition treaty, a point of contention for survivors.</p>

Despite being a fifth-round draft pick and fourth on the depth chart, injuries provided him the opportunity to start, where he demonstrated significant poise.

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress on the Canyon fire near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line, achieving 28% containment and allowing thousands of evacuated residents to return home. The wildfire, which started during a heat wave, has burned 5,370 acres, destroyed at least two structures, and injured three firefighters. While evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings, public health officials have issued a smoke advisory for the area through the weekend due to unhealthy air quality. Crews are continuing to reinforce containment lines amid challenging, hot weather conditions.</p>

This forecast is based on several warning signs, including underlying weakness in consumer-focused sectors, the historical underperformance of semiconductor stocks in late summer, and the potential for credit spreads to widen from their current tight levels.

          <p>The leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, aimed at ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by President Donald Trump, the deal involves a commitment to cease all fighting permanently and to open up travel, business, and diplomatic relations. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will help build a major transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory. Both Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan praised the milestone agreement.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit van, a cultural and commercial staple, is celebrating its 60th anniversary since first rolling off the production line in 1965. Originally a revelation for its space, power, and comfort, the Transit quickly became the vehicle of choice for tradespeople, delivery drivers, and even rock bands like Led Zeppelin. Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey in 2013, the van remains the world's best-selling model, with over 13 million built. Ford's development focus is now on electric and software-defined versions to maintain its market leadership amid growing competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent bans of fashion ads from major UK retailers like Zara and M&S have sparked concerns about a potential return of the "super skinny" aesthetic in modeling. The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has reported a "definite uptick" in complaints about models appearing unhealthily thin, though it notes that styling and camera angles often contribute to the perception. Activists and models worry this trend, potentially influenced by 90s fashion revivals and weight-loss drugs, could undermine the progress of the body positivity movement and promote harmful body image ideals.</p>

The crew, consisting of astronauts from the U.S., Japan, and Russia, is scheduled for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. During their 148-day mission, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments and were replaced by the newly arrived Crew-11. This mission marks the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific, a change made to ensure debris falls in unpopulated areas.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump stated that a deal is getting closer and suggested it would involve "some swapping of territories," a condition Ukraine has repeatedly rejected. The Kremlin confirmed the summit, calling it logical. The announcement follows reports that Putin offered a ceasefire contingent on Kyiv withdrawing its forces from the Donbass region, a proposal met with skepticism by European officials as it would cede occupied territory to Russia.</p>

          <p>Despite their vastly different political ideologies, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy have formed a strong personal friendship. Vance, a conservative Republican, is currently on a holiday trip in the UK, which began with a family stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences of challenging upbringings, their Christian faith, and their time at prestigious U.S. universities. This personal relationship is seen as a potentially valuable diplomatic channel, particularly given the personalized nature of the current U.S. administration's foreign policy.</p>

Activists allege that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is operating a covert, overcrowded detention facility on the 10th floor of the 26 Federal Plaza building. Demonstrators held a sit-in demanding access for officials and journalists, which was denied before police moved in. The protest follows the release of footage showing poor conditions inside the facility, which authorities maintain is only a temporary processing center.</p>

          <p>A searing new biography by author Andrew Lownie, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," presents an intensely unflattering portrait of Prince Andrew, potentially sealing his fate regarding any public return. The book details his arrogance, poor judgment, and deep connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, supported by hundreds of interviews. It paints a picture of a man known for rudeness and a lack of self-awareness, while also exploring suggestions of a lonely and socially awkward figure behind the bombastic exterior. The account reinforces the damage his scandals have caused the monarchy.</p>

          <p>An investigation has found no evidence to support a viral social media claim that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times. The claim, which originated from a Facebook user purporting to be a retired pilot, is discredited by several facts. Notably, Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making landings by a plane like Trump's impossible; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. The user's credentials were also questionable, as the photo shared appeared to feature a costume pilot pin from an online retailer.</p>
