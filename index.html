          <p>Kenza Dali expresses her intent to reveal her experiences following the Euros, motivated by what she perceives as inaccuracies in the current narrative. Dali emphasizes her respect for her teammates and her desire to avoid diverting attention from their preparations for the tournament. She feels saddened by her exclusion from the squad, especially considering her recent strong performances in football, and highlights her enjoyment of playing in the NWSL for San Diego, appreciating the tactical approach of coach Jonas Eidevall.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) identifies Cameroon as facing the world's most neglected refugee crisis, characterized by insufficient political attention, media coverage, and funding. The NRC notes that over 1.1 million people are internally displaced within Cameroon, along with 480,000 refugees from neighboring countries, particularly the Central African Republic. Cameroon is grappling with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western regions, rooted in historical divisions, and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants. The article highlights the plight of displaced individuals like Haoua, who struggles to provide for her family after her husband's arrest and son-in-law's death at the hands of militants. The article concludes by noting that the ISS' Hoinathy suggests that regional cooperation is crucial for improving security and stability, but faces challenges due to fatigue. </p>

          <p>Surprise raids by ICE in downtown Los Angeles led to protests and condemnation from elected officials and community members, who described the actions as cruel and terrorizing. The raids targeted employees in the fashion district, with federal agents using flash grenades and pepper spray on protesters. Forty-four people were arrested administratively, and one for obstruction, during the operation that executed search warrants related to harboring undocumented individuals. The Mexican Consulate reported that at least 11 Mexican citizens were detained and offered legal services. The director of SEIU California, David Huerta, was injured and detained while documenting a raid, leading to further outcry. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly compensate their athletes. The settlement, approved by Judge Claudia Wilken, enables schools to begin paying athletes as early as next month. It includes provisions for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion to be paid over the next decade to former players who were previously restricted from such revenue. Payouts will vary based on the sport and length of athletic career, with potential earnings reaching nearly $135,000 for most football and men's basketball players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran has strongly criticized the US travel ban affecting Iranians and citizens of 11 other predominantly Middle Eastern and African countries, denouncing it as a sign of a racist mentality. The ban, enacted through an executive order, revives restrictions reminiscent of the previous administration's travel policies. An Iranian foreign ministry official, Alireza Hashemi-Raja, described the measure as indicative of a supremacist and racist mindset among American policymakers. He asserted that the policy violates international law by denying travel rights based solely on nationality or religion. The US is home to a significant Iranian diaspora, estimated at around 1.5 million people in 2020. </p>

          <p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez, outwardly a global businessman and polo club ambassador, led a double life as a major drug trafficker. While cultivating an image of respectability and even providing information to authorities, Hafeez orchestrated a vast drug empire, dealing in heroin, methamphetamine, and hashish. He informed on rival cartels to eliminate competition, earning the nickname "the Sultan." A joint operation by British and American authorities led to his extradition and subsequent sentencing to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs. The BBC investigation uncovered how Hafeez maintained his facade for so long and the events that led to his capture. </p>

The parents hope to connect with others to better understand Jack's diagnosis and find support, as medical information is limited. Amanda has connected with one other parent whose daughter had the same condition but passed away at the age of two, finding the shared experience helpful.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. He appeared in federal court in Nashville, with his arraignment set for June 13. Abrego Garcia's lawyer calls the case "baseless," asserting that the charges are based on statements from individuals facing prosecution or in federal prison. The case has become a symbol of tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary, as Abrego Garcia was deported despite a judge's order protecting him from deportation. The US Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return after admitting to an "administrative error." </p>

          <p>A furniture fraud involving the Palace of Versailles has come to light, revealing that several ornate chairs believed to be from the 18th century were fakes. The chairs, purportedly belonging to figures like Marie Antoinette, were sold for millions before being exposed. Antiques expert Georges "Bill" Pallot and cabinetmaker Bruno Desnoues have admitted to fraud and money laundering, while Galerie Kraemer denies deception by gross negligence. The scheme began as a "joke" to replicate an armchair, leading to the creation and sale of multiple forged pieces. </p>

          <p>MI5 provided false information to its watchdog, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), regarding the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent, leading to the rewriting of a report. The early draft of the IPCO report contradicted false evidence given by MI5 in court, but the final version did not. IPCO stated it was "misled" by the Security Service, and MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum apologized after the BBC challenged the false statements. This revelation raises concerns about MI5's accountability and IPCO's ability to ensure the Security Service operates within the law. The case involves an agent known as X, who used his Security Service role to coerce and terrorize his then-girlfriend. </p>
