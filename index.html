          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel issued a strong warning after the bureau disrupted a mass shooting plot at a military base in Michigan planned on behalf of ISIS. The former Michigan Army National Guard member, Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, was arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting near the U.S. Army’s Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) center. Said faces charges of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and distributing information related to a destructive device. Patel commended the Joint Terrorism Task Force and law enforcement partners for their dedication to protecting the American people.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura's cross-examination in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial delved into her drug habits and explicit text messages with Combs. The defense suggested that Combs might have been suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms in the days leading up to the alleged sexual assault captured by hotel surveillance cameras. The defense also implied that Ventura initiated the idea of a "freak off" before the movie premiere, and that the violence that occurred during that encounter at the Century City InterContinental could have been due to a bad batch of drugs. Ventura will return to the stand on Friday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey indicated that consumers may start seeing higher prices due to tariffs, potentially towards the end of the month and more significantly in June. Despite Walmart beating quarterly earnings expectations, Rainey expressed concern that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than retailers can absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Walmart also posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration. While Trump confirmed the plans, stating it wasn't tied to his birthday and the cost would be "peanuts," some Democrats have criticized the event as wasteful and self-aggrandizing, especially given the prior postponement of a similar parade due to high costs.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's increasing reliance on officials holding multiple positions, a practice known as dual-hatting, and its implications. Figures like Todd Blanche and Marco Rubio are juggling multiple high-level roles, raising concerns about dysfunction, conflicts of interest, and potential incompetence. The article suggests this trend reflects Trump's attempts to learn from his first term and implement Project 2025, but it also highlights the administration's difficulties in filling key positions with qualified individuals, potentially weakening critical institutions like the National Archives.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the impact of President Trump's tariff easing on small businesses. While the reduction from 145% to 30% on Chinese goods provides some breathing room, the uncertainty of a 90-day pause leaves many businesses hesitant to make long-term plans. Several business owners express concerns about rising costs, potential layoffs, and pausing new product development. They emphasize the need for a long-term trade deal to make predictable decisions, as even the reduced tariff rate still poses challenges, particularly for those with tight margins.</p>

Dick's, the largest sports retail chain in the U.S., seeks to gain Foot Locker's extensive store footprint and urban consumer base. While Dick's investors showed initial concern due to Foot Locker's declining sales and store closures, the acquisition is expected to enhance the omnichannel experience and strengthen the combined entity's position in the industry.

          <p>A federal jury in Delaware ruled that Amgen owes Regeneron more than $406 million for anticompetitive behavior related to its cholesterol-reduction drug, Repatha. The jury agreed that Amgen unlawfully bundled Repatha with other drugs to persuade pharmacy benefit managers to favor it over Regeneron's Praluent. The verdict includes $271.2 million in punitive damages for Regeneron. Amgen plans to pursue post-trial proceedings, while Regeneron's CEO emphasized that larger companies should not be allowed to use such tactics to push competitors out of the market.</p>
