          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, impacting global markets. Cheap Chinese imports could ease the cost-of-living crisis and help bring down inflationary pressure, benefiting consumers and economies with limited manufacturing bases. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., China is doubling down on manufacturing, stirring anxiety in Asia about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. This influx of low-cost Chinese goods could provide central banks some relief as they juggle lowering living costs and reviving growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is celebrated 150 years after his birth as a voice for democracy. His literary works, including "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," reflect his life spent navigating diverse worlds. Mann opposed the Nazi party and delivered radio speeches against authoritarianism. After denouncing Nazi policies, he emigrated to the U.S. and later returned to Switzerland, leaving behind a legacy of courage and steadfastness in the face of fascism.</p>

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth as reasons for the move. The decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, but the RBI held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The central bank also changed its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative," indicating limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

The report found that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries "best positioned to adopt AI" since 2022. Wages of workers with AI skills are 56% higher compared to those without, and the report indicates that AI can enrich jobs by freeing employees from tedious tasks.</p>

The BBC's investigation found that cases recorded as an "E72" are increasing, indicating a higher proportion of prosecutions failing due to unavailable evidence.
