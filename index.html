Despite Trump later suggesting a resolution, Goldman Sachs indicates China may be seeking greater concessions.

          <p>More than 150 unvaccinated students from two Spartanburg County schools in South Carolina have been placed under a 21-day quarantine following measles exposures. This incident contributes to at least eight new cases in the state, bringing the year's total to 11. Nationally, the U.S. has reported over 1,563 measles cases this year, the highest since 1992, amid declining MMR vaccination rates among kindergarteners. The situation underscores a growing public health concern due to reduced immunity, affecting an estimated 286,000 kindergarteners without protection.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have announced a revised pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, pushing Shohei Ohtani's next start to later in the series. Yoshinobu Yamamoto will now pitch Game 2 instead of Ohtani, allowing Yamamoto to stay on his regular five-day rest schedule for a potential Game 6. Manager Dave Roberts indicated the change also allows Ohtani more time to focus on his hitting, following a challenging offensive performance in the NL Division Series. The article notes this strategic alignment could optimize pitcher usage in the series.</p>

          <p>A new report by the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute declares coral reefs the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate "tipping point," marking an "unprecedented crisis." Scientists confirm widespread "dieback" of coral reefs globally, primarily due to rising ocean temperatures causing mass bleaching events. With 70-90% of coral expected to die at 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, the report emphasizes the irreversible consequences for marine life and the billion people reliant on reefs. It calls for immediate, unprecedented action to decarbonize society and minimize further damage. The article notes small pockets of coral are expected to survive.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a "warning" to American colleges and universities, criticizing them for allegedly promoting "WOKE, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology" and engaging in unconstitutional discriminatory practices. He announced plans for a "Great Reform Agenda in Higher Education" to prioritize merit, hard work, and free speech, while ending "racist Admission Policies" and foreign financial entanglements. Trump threatened forceful enforcement of federal law for non-compliant institutions, but also invited collaboration for those willing to return to "Truth and Achievement."

          <p>Vice-President JD Vance has warned of further "painful" job cuts beyond the thousands already implemented if the U.S. government shutdown persists into its third week. Democrats are blamed for the impasse, refusing to pass a spending bill without federal health insurance subsidies. While many federal employees are on unpaid leave, the Trump administration made an exception for military personnel, securing $8 billion to ensure their paychecks. The article highlights the political deadlock and the growing impact on government services, including the temporary closure of Smithsonian museums.</p>

          <p>Dow futures surged after President Trump's conciliatory remarks on Truth Social, telling investors "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!" This eased market fears following his earlier threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export limits. Analysts suggest markets are leaning into the "TACO (Trump always chickens out) trade," interpreting Trump's aggressive rhetoric as a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy. This article explains how investors anticipate a pullback from the brink of a full-blown trade war, viewing market dips as buying opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, is actively pursuing the acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming for a massive merger that would reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share bid, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. This potential consolidation could merge HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros. studios with Paramount's assets, including CBS News. The move is driven by Paramount's need for more content to compete with streaming giants, despite Warner Bros. Discovery's significant debt and recent successes at the box office.</p>

This move, marked by Modi's first visit to China in seven years and the resumption of direct flights, underscores India's pursuit of "strategic autonomy" and a desire not to view bilateral relations through a "third country lens," particularly concerning its relationship with the U.S. Both leaders envision their relationship as an anchor for a multipolar world and a new Asian century.
