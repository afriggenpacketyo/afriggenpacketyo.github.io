          <p>The Trump administration unveiled a plan to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, prompted by a recent communications outage at Newark Liberty International Airport. President Trump announced the initiative, which includes replacing technology at over 4,600 air traffic control sites and building six new coordination centers, estimating the project will cost billions of dollars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized the need for upgrades to prevent future disruptions, citing the Newark incident as an example of the system's aging infrastructure. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian voiced his support for the plan, highlighting the necessity of significant government investment in air traffic control modernization to ensure safety and efficiency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration released over 60,000 pages of records related to the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, marking the second release of documents related to the 1968 killing. The documents include witness interviews, FBI memos, and transcripts of police interviews with Sirhan Sirhan, the convicted killer. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had previously urged the Obama administration to reopen the investigation into his father's death, and the documents include a 2012 letter from him requesting this. While some details in the files were already known, the release aims to provide maximum transparency regarding the investigation into Kennedy's assassination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic data indicates that many companies plan to pass the costs of tariffs onto consumers, potentially leading to rising prices. A survey of Texas manufacturers revealed that 76% intend to pass tariff-related costs to consumers, while large retailers have also warned of potential price increases. Experts predict that inflation will rise significantly in the coming months, with some estimating an average cost of $5,200 per year for households due to the tariffs. Despite President Trump's claims that foreign exporters will absorb the costs, businesses are already hiking prices to offset higher expenses.</p>

The move would leave insurance companies, researchers, and policymakers without key information needed to assess risks and allocate resources effectively.

While the agreement provides relief for Britain's auto industry and includes provisions for steel, aluminum, and beef exports, key details are still under negotiation. The agreement could be derailed before it takes effect.

          <p>A sexual assault case against film director Paul Haggis in Italy has been dismissed, with his U.S. attorney suggesting the allegations were fabricated to damage his chances in a previous New York civil case. Haggis was accused of sexually assaulting a woman over two days in 2022, but the Italian judge ruled that no sex acts took place without consent. Haggis maintains his innocence and claims he lost writing jobs due to the accusations. His U.S. attorney believes the timing of the allegations was designed to influence the outcome of a civil case in New York, where Haggis was found liable and ordered to pay $10 million.</p>

While Shopify's CFO stated that the expiration of a trade loophole for lower-cost goods is not expected to have a significant impact in the near term, the company is actively monitoring the situation. Shopify's CFO noted that consumers who purchase from Shopify businesses skew higher income, with more than half of buyers in the U.S. having incomes above $100,000, which may help insulate merchants from pricing swings.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden discussed Kamala Harris' loss in the 2024 presidential election, attributing it to sexism and racism. In an interview on ABC's "The View," Biden expressed his belief that Harris was highly qualified but faced unfair biases. Biden also mentioned his ongoing self-reflection and plans to write a book, and he affirmed his continued close relationship with Harris. The article also mentions that sources have said Harris may be mulling a run for governor of California, her home state; others have speculated she could mount a run for president in 2028.</p>

The agency said its National Centers for Environmental Information would no longer update its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024. Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming increasingly more frequent, costly and severe with the climate crisis.

The conflict is rooted in competing claims over the Kashmir region, and the recent escalation follows a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to unveil a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, which he has teased as an "earth-shattering" announcement. The Trump administration previously sought to implement the "most favored nation" idea during Mr. Trump's first term, tying some high-cost Medicare drugs administered by health care providers to "the lowest price that drug manufacturers receive in other countries." Court orders previously blocked the implementation of this proposal, and the Biden administration abandoned it in 2022. The plan's potential reintroduction has sparked debate, with concerns raised about its impact on drug access and innovation.</p>
