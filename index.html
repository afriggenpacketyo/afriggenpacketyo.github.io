          <p>President Trump announced a comprehensive tariff plan imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, with significantly higher rates for specific countries deemed "worst offenders."  These include China (54%), the European Union (20%), and several others in Asia and elsewhere.  The plan aims to address perceived trade imbalances and protect American industries, but experts warn of potential negative impacts on global growth and consumer prices.  Canada and Mexico were notably excluded from the reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's latest tariff announcements, the effective tariff rate on Chinese goods has significantly increased.  Citi research estimates the rate to be around 65%, while Capital Economics suggests a figure closer to 70%. This includes newly imposed tariffs, previously implemented measures, and the phasing out of the "de minimis" exemption for low-value imports.

          <p>Senate Republicans released a budget resolution designed to facilitate the passage of President Trump's legislative priorities.  The resolution sets spending targets for various committees and paves the way for using the reconciliation process to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold.  The plan includes provisions for tax cuts, increased defense spending, and border security measures.  The resolution's passage would represent a significant step towards implementing Trump's agenda.</p>
