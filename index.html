          <p>New York City mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa fiercely debated critical issues, including former President Trump's looming influence on the city and the pervasive challenge of urban affordability. Mamdani, a progressive, defended his past remarks on Israel and cited his lived experience, while Cuomo faced renewed scrutiny over sexual assault allegations and his administration's handling of nursing home deaths during the pandemic. Republican candidate Sliwa positioned himself as an anti-establishment outsider, criticizing both opponents for their political backgrounds.

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced a record 39.1% surge in third-quarter profit, significantly exceeding estimates, primarily fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence chips. As a major supplier for companies like Nvidia and AMD, TSMC has benefited immensely from the ongoing AI boom. The company subsequently raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its capacity expansion plans to $40 billion for the full year. Despite monitoring potential U.S. tariff impacts, TSMC's strategic investments in U.S. facilities could help mitigate these risks, underscoring its strong market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Radule Bojovic, a police officer in Hanover Park, Illinois, accusing him of overstaying a tourist visa from Montenegro that expired in 2015. The Department of Homeland Security strongly criticized the employment of an individual allegedly living illegally in the U.S. and possessing a firearm, deeming it a felony. Hanover Park Mayor Rodney Craig, however, defended the hiring, asserting that comprehensive background checks confirmed Bojovic's legal work authorization prior to his employment. The village intends to monitor his immigration proceedings, with potential reinstatement if his legal work status in the U.S. is affirmed. This article highlights a complex intersection of immigration law, local governance, and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of the U.S. military's Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), announced his unexpected retirement from the Navy after 37 years, effective mid-December, just over a year into his command. This high-profile departure occurs amidst heightened tensions in the Caribbean, where the Trump administration is conducting an aggressive anti-drug trafficking mission involving strikes on alleged drug boats and increased pressure on Venezuela. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth commended Holsey's service, but Senator Jack Reed voiced concern over the instability signaled by the top commander's exit during such a critical geopolitical period.

          <p>News of a two-and-a-half-hour phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where they agreed to a summit in Budapest to discuss the Ukraine war, created significant uncertainty for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This development occurred as Zelenskyy traveled to Washington with high hopes of securing long-range Tomahawk missiles and increased American military assistance. The article suggests the call, reportedly initiated by Russia, is a classic Putin tactic to placate Trump and deter tougher U.S. action, potentially undermining Zelenskyy's diplomatic efforts.

          <p>China announced sweeping new curbs on its rare earth exports, significantly tightening its near-monopoly on these critical minerals, which are essential for various technologies from smartphones to fighter jets. This strategic move, detailed in "announcement No. 62 of 2025," now requires foreign companies to obtain Chinese government approval and declare the intended use for products containing even tiny amounts of rare earths. In response, President Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, escalating the trade war. Experts suggest these restrictions provide China with significant leverage ahead of an upcoming meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping, targeting vulnerabilities in American supply chains despite the minimal economic value of these exports to China.

          <p>The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers near Venezuela's coast, approximately 150 miles north, as the Trump administration continues to exert significant pressure on President Nicolás Maduro's government. This mission is part of a monthslong increase in military activity in the region, which includes deployed warships, fighter jets, and a nuclear submarine, with approximately 10,000 U.S. forces now present in the Caribbean. President Trump also confirmed authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela and considering land-based strikes on drug traffickers. Tensions have sharply spiked, with Maduro denying cartel ties and accusing the U.S. of plotting regime change. This article details a significant escalation of military and covert actions in the region.</p>

          <p>California's landscape has been dramatically transformed by the season's first major storm, bringing much-needed precipitation and blanketing mountain peaks with snow. Dazzling satellite photos from NOAA and NASA satellites illustrate the rapid change, showing parched brown peaks replaced by brilliant white across the Sierra Nevada range and extending into Nevada and Utah. This deluge has elevated most of the state's largest reservoirs to historical levels for this time of year and significantly delayed the fire season in Los Angeles. Experts hail this "weak atmospheric river" as a favorable start to the water year, aiding the state's recovery from persistent drought conditions. This article showcases the profound environmental impact of recent weather.</p>

          <p>Two suspects were arrested in connection with an armed home invasion near Tampa, Florida, where an Apple AirTag was used to track the victims' SUV to their home. Surveillance video captured the chilling moment the men forced a couple into their garage, but an activated house alarm prompted their swift flight. Investigators later discovered the AirTag taped under the vehicle and were remarkably able to identify the suspects, Luis Charles and Omardy Maldonado-Rodriguez, because they allegedly used their real names to purchase and register the device. This article highlights a concerning new method of criminal tracking using common technology, while also demonstrating how built-in features can inadvertently aid law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Two cases of the potentially more severe Mpox "Clade I" strain have been confirmed in Los Angeles County, marking the first time this variant has been found in the U.S. among people with no history of overseas travel to high-risk areas. Clade I is particularly concerning due to its potential for more severe illness and easier spread, including through close personal contact beyond sexual activity. Both affected patients were hospitalized but are now recovering at home. Health officials emphasize the importance of continued surveillance, early response, and vaccination, while urging anyone with unexplained rashes or lesions to seek medical evaluation promptly.

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon, now a debut novelist, discussed her new thriller "Gone Before Goodbye," co-written with bestselling author Harlan Coben. She aimed to create a female protagonist with unique skills rather than relying on sex appeal, inspired by her childhood questioning why James Bond girls wore bikinis while solving crimes. Witherspoon, whose parents were in medical military roles, drew on her background for the character, a surgeon facing career setbacks. The article highlights her ongoing commitment through her production company, Hello Sunshine, to complex female storytelling, and her excitement for this new creative frontier, even as she jokes about the intensity of her multifaceted career.</p>

          <p>Uganda's Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit, is increasingly seen as a private army for President Yoweri Museveni, bolstering his 39-year grip on power and his family's expanding dynasty. Critics accuse the SFC, once commanded by Museveni's son Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, of abducting, torturing, and killing opposition activists, allegations the SFC denies. The unit's growing influence and perceived ethnic recruitment are causing resentment among regular army generals, raising fears of a Sudan-like power struggle in the post-Museveni era. Parliament recently legalized the SFC, a move critics argue validates an entity previously operating illegally. This article highlights serious concerns over authoritarianism and military control in Uganda.</p>

          <p>China's vast property market is projected to continue its decline at least through 2026, with S&P Global Ratings estimating an 8% fall in nationwide primary property sales in 2025 and a further 6-7% in 2026. This sustained downturn will intensify pressure on Chinese developers, many of whom are already struggling to deliver homes while simultaneously managing substantial debt obligations. The article cites developer Cifi's plan to cancel existing debts, release debtors, and issue approximately US$6.73 billion in new bonds as an example of ongoing restructuring efforts within the sector.

          <p>President Donald Trump's highly unusual admission of authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela, typically a tightly guarded state secret, grants the agency broad leeway for various regional actions. This "presidential finding" could lead to diverse operations, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or broader efforts aimed at destabilizing or toppling the Nicolás Maduro regime. Historical precedents for such findings include drone strikes, funneling weapons to insurgencies, and even full regime change. Experts warn of a "slippery slope" given the CIA's often controversial history in Latin America. This article highlights the significant, potentially limitless, implications of this authorization for U.S. foreign policy and regional stability.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Trump, was indicted by a federal grand jury on 18 counts related to the unlawful transmission and retention of classified documents. Prosecutors allege Bolton shared over a thousand pages of classified "diary-like entries" with two unauthorized relatives via personal email and messaging apps, and retained sensitive information at his home. The indictment also claims an Iranian cyber actor hacked his personal email, accessing this classified data. Bolton denies wrongdoing, calling the charges "Trump's retribution" and an abuse of power, echoing sentiments from other recently charged Trump critics.
