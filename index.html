          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas after catastrophic flash floods led to a death toll of at least 109, with over 100 people still missing. Kerr County was the most severely affected, with a significant number of fatalities occurring at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River. In response to the disaster, President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, enabling FEMA to support local and state recovery efforts. Scrutiny has arisen over the adequacy of weather warnings, with some residents reporting they did not receive emergency alerts before the river swelled to unprecedented levels.</p>

          <p>Doctors are expressing concern that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals and clinics is creating an atmosphere of fear, deterring some people from seeking essential medical care. While ICE agents are often present to get medical clearance for detainees, their appearance, sometimes in tactical gear, is reportedly causing patients to delay critical treatment. Medical professionals highlight that these delays can have severe health consequences. The article notes that this situation raises ethical issues regarding patient privacy and the right to healthcare, prompting some hospitals to issue guidance to staff on how to handle such encounters.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed American warship, deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the 1942 Battle of Tassafaronga, an event that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically managed to save the ship, which was later repaired and returned to service. The discovery was made during seafloor mapping operations by the Ocean Exploration Trust, and the finding is seen as an opportunity to honor the sacrifice and resilience of the ship's valiant crew.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the United States will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows an investigation into the national security effects of foreign-sourced metal. The decision caused US copper prices to jump and is expected to be formalized by the end of the month. This tariff aligns with similar levies on steel and aluminum and is part of a broader strategy to protect American industries. The move will primarily affect suppliers like Chile and Canada, while raising concerns for US firms that depend on copper for manufacturing in sectors like construction and electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>During a Cabinet meeting, President Trump admonished a reporter for asking about Jeffrey Epstein, calling the question a "desecration" in light of other national issues like the Texas floods. The exchange occurred a day after the Justice Department concluded that the convicted sex offender died by suicide and that no "client list" was found. Following the president's remarks, Attorney General Pam Bondi addressed the question, explaining that a missing minute in a jail surveillance video was due to a system reset.

The article also advises shopping at online banks, which often provide higher rates, and locking in a favorable fixed rate soon.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of up to 200% on imported pharmaceuticals, a move he said could happen "very soon." However, he suggested that the pharmaceutical industry would be given a grace period of about a year and a half to bring manufacturing operations to the U.S. before the levies take full effect. The threat follows a national security investigation into pharmaceutical imports initiated in April. The industry has pushed back, warning that such tariffs could disrupt the drug supply chain, deter investment, and ultimately increase costs for patients.</p>

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that the annual cost of the state pension's "triple lock" guarantee will be three times higher by 2030 than originally estimated, reaching £15.5 billion. The triple lock ensures the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report warns that the UK's public finances are in a "vulnerable position" due to this and other spending pressures. This rising cost, driven by inflation volatility and an aging population, contributes to what the OBR describes as an unsustainable long-term fiscal path for the country.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the long-standing debate within the Democratic party about the best approach to social welfare policy, a discussion intensified by recent cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid. Progressives argue that universal programs such as Social Security are more politically durable because they benefit a broader swath of the population. However, the article counters this by noting that some universal programs have also faced cuts, while targeted anti-poverty spending has grown significantly over the past few decades. It concludes that while universal benefits have policy advantages, the political difficulty of funding them makes means-tested programs a complex but often necessary reality.</p>

          <p>During a Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump suggested the possibility of a federal takeover of New York City and Washington, D.C. While discussing New York's mayoral election, he stated the White House has "tremendous power" to run places when necessary. He then focused on the nation's capital, complaining about crime and stating his administration is considering taking it over to ensure it is "run flawlessly." While Washington D.C. has home rule, Congress retains final oversight of its laws and budget, a power that has been used to block local legislation in the past.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, battled by over a thousand firefighters, has reached the edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city, prompting evacuations and a temporary airport closure. The blaze, which officials say was sparked by a car fire, spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions. Authorities have urged residents to stay indoors and keep roads clear for emergency services as crews engage in what the city's mayor described as "guerrilla warfare" to defend the urban area. The incident is part of a series of wildfires across Southern Europe, with other significant fires reported in Spain and Greece amid an early summer heatwave.</p>

          <h2>Economic Factors, Including Drought and Herd Size, Drive US Beef Prices to Record Highs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:37:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. beef prices have climbed to their highest levels since tracking began in the 1980s, putting financial pressure on both consumers and restaurants. The primary cause is a classic case of supply and demand, with the national cattle herd shrinking to its smallest size since the 1960s. This reduction in supply is largely attributed to years of severe drought, particularly in the western U.S., which forced ranchers to sell off cattle due to a lack of feedstock. With demand for beef remaining robust, experts predict that tight supplies will likely keep prices elevated for the next several years as the industry slowly rebuilds its herds.</p>

          <p>Anti-government protests in Kenya turned deadly, with the state-funded human rights commission reporting that 31 people were killed on Monday, the highest single-day death toll this year. The demonstrations, part of a weeks-long movement, call for better governance, police accountability, and the removal of President William Ruto over corruption allegations. The protests coincided with a historically significant date for pro-democracy movements in the country. In response to the violence, which also saw over 100 injuries and 500 arrests, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged for calm and for the grievances driving the protests to be addressed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that he cannot block the Trump administration's decision to rescind hundreds of millions of dollars in grants for anti-violence programs, despite calling the action "shameful." The lawsuit was filed by five non-profit organizations that lost their funding from the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs. The department stated the funds were being redirected to support law enforcement operations. While Judge Amit P. Mehta was critical of the cuts, he concluded that he did not have the legal authority to issue an injunction that would force the government to continue the funding.</p>

          <p>This analysis of the new 'Superman' film argues that its most brilliant choice is placing the hero in a world already populated with other super-powered individuals. This approach, a departure from many previous adaptations, helps to define what makes Superman exceptional by contrasting him with his peers. The article praises the movie's consciously sincere and lighthearted tone, which evokes the fun of classic cartoons. By surrounding Superman with characters who are skeptical of his pure altruism, the film cleverly addresses and embraces the potential corniness of the character for a modern, cynical audience.</p>

          <p>For those with $20,000 to save, this article compares the potential earnings of a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account in the current economic climate. Based on current rates, short-term CDs tend to earn slightly more interest than high-yield savings accounts over the same period. However, the article emphasizes that CD rates are fixed, requiring the money to be locked away, while high-yield savings rates are variable but keep funds accessible. The best choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus their desire for a guaranteed, fixed return on their deposit. (not investment advice)</p>

On one side are the AI zealots, who believe its rapid, world-altering ascension is inevitable and dismiss all immediate downsides. On the other are the skeptics, who call AI an overhyped "con" and insist on its fundamental limitations and eventual collapse. This escalating war of rhetoric, fueled by massive industry investment and the technology's ubiquity, has become a contest of faith.
