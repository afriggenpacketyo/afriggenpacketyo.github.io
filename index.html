          <p>Federal prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, citing his alleged desire to incite resistance against the victim's industry. Mangione is expected to plead not guilty to the four-count indictment, which includes murder through the use of a firearm. Attorney General Pam Bondi signaled the Trump administration's intention to pursue capital punishment in this case. Defense attorneys have denounced the decision as barbaric and a political stunt, setting the stage for a contentious legal battle. Optimism score is 30 because someone was killed and they are seeking the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Ward is the third consecutive quarterback to be chosen first overall. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter at No. 2. The draft is considered less talent-laden than previous years, leading to unpredictability in the selections.

          <p>President Trump is considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, reversing over a decade of U.S. policy. During his first term, Trump had suggested he would "take a look" at the matter, but his administration later doubled down against Moscow. This potential shift would walk away from the official "Crimea Declaration" issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged to maintain nonrecognition until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny amid the 'Signalgate' controversy and subsequent leaks of sensitive military information, revealing internal divisions within the Trump administration, particularly concerning Iran policy. The firing of three high-ranking Department of Defense officials, including Dan Caldwell, a known Iran dove, suggests Hegseth's commitment to addressing leaks, even at the expense of former allies. The situation is further complicated by ongoing Iran nuclear negotiations led by Steve Witkoff, raising questions about the administration's approach to Iran. Ultimately, the attacks on Hegseth appear to be driven by frustration that President Trump is not more receptive to Iran-curious policies.</p>

The Partnership for Public Service estimates these costs could reach $135 billion this fiscal year, with the IRS potentially losing $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 due to DOGE-driven employee departures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration confirmed that ICE agents arrested Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil without a warrant, citing "exigent circumstances". Khalil's attorneys are seeking to terminate his deportation case, arguing the warrantless arrest was unlawful. Khalil, a Syrian-born immigrant with legal U.S. residency, was arrested outside his apartment. The administration has cited immigration fraud and Khalil's alleged adverse foreign policy consequences as reasons for deportation.</p>
