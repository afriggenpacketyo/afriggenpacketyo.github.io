          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street from its markets, accusing it of large-scale manipulation of the Nifty 50 index. The regulator alleges the firm used a strategy of buying stocks to inflate the index before placing large bets on its decline, then selling off its holdings to profit from the resulting drop. SEBI has frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains, stating the actions were a deliberate strategy that undermined market integrity. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated its commitment to operating in compliance with all regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a proposal to create a process allowing farmers to vouch for their long-term, law-abiding undocumented immigrant workers, potentially shielding them from deportation. Speaking at an event in Iowa, Trump stated that legislation is being drafted in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security to address farmers' concerns about losing essential labor. He acknowledged that the move might face criticism from some on the "radical-right" but emphasized the importance of supporting the nation's agricultural and hospitality industries. The plan would place responsibility on the farmers who vouch for the workers.</p>

          <p>The article explores the accessibility and inclusivity of Berlin's club scene, focusing on the experiences of Felize, a 20-year-old wheelchair user who frequents the famous techno club Berghain. While many clubs, including Berghain, cultivate an image as "safe spaces," they often present significant physical and social barriers for people with disabilities. Felize describes the practical challenges of planning a night out and the social hurdles, such as patrons being unsure how to interact with her. Despite these obstacles, she advocates for greater visibility and empathy to make clubbing a more normal and inclusive experience for everyone.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group took power in 2021. The move, which Russia's foreign ministry framed as an opportunity for economic cooperation, has been praised by the Taliban as a "courageous" decision. However, it has sparked outrage from Afghan opposition figures and women's rights advocates, who warn that it legitimizes a regime known for severe restrictions on women and girls and risks global security. The decision marks a significant diplomatic milestone for the Taliban, which has been largely isolated internationally.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it is consulting with other Palestinian factions before responding to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. The plan reportedly includes a phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, increased humanitarian aid, and a gradual Israeli military withdrawal. A key sticking point remains Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war, which Israel has not committed to. Meanwhile, President Trump stated he expects to know Hamas's decision within 24 hours, as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to returning all hostages.</p>

According to local police, the two women were charged and trampled by a female elephant that was with its calf. Tour guides reportedly fired shots in an attempt to stop the animal, but their efforts were unsuccessful, and both tourists died at the scene. Authorities have previously urged caution when observing wildlife, as female elephants can be extremely protective of their young, and this incident follows other fatal elephant attacks on tourists in the country.</p>

          <p>A judge in Jackson County, Missouri, has once again blocked many of the state's restrictive abortion laws, including a near-total ban triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The ruling reinstates a preliminary injunction, arguing that the restrictions likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion that was approved by voters in a ballot measure last year. This decision allows Planned Parenthood to resume providing procedural abortions in the state, though medication abortions remain on hold. The Missouri Attorney General's office has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, continuing the protracted legal battle over abortion access in the state.</p>

Cities like Salt Lake City have adopted the high-tech displays to reduce wildfire risks in drought conditions and to offer a quieter, more inclusive celebration for those with noise sensitivities, such as veterans with PTSD. While some communities have pushed back, preferring the classic pyrotechnics, the drone show industry is booming as it promises spectacular, choreographed aerial displays.

          <p>Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff suggests that President Trump's trade policies are a significant catalyst for the U.S. dollar's recent weakness, which is experiencing its worst start to a year in five decades. Rogoff explains that actions like trade wars and threats of taxes on foreign investment make holding dollars less attractive and create uncertainty for global investors. While a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exporters by making their goods cheaper, it increases the cost of imports and travel for Americans. The trend is raising concerns about the dollar's long-term status as the world's primary reserve currency. (not investment advice)</p>

They also highlighted the massive increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The author contends that despite concerns from both moderate and fiscally conservative Republicans, they ultimately fell in line with Trump's demands, abandoning their stated principles. The piece details the bill's devastating impacts, such as an estimated 17 million people losing health coverage and deep cuts to food assistance, while massively benefiting billionaires and ICE.
