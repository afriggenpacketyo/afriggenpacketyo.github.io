          <p>Quarterback Cam Ward from Miami was chosen as the first overall pick in the NFL Draft by the Tennessee Titans, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars made a surprising trade to select Colorado's two-way star Travis Hunter as the second pick. Shedeur Sanders, Hunter's quarterback at Colorado, was notably overlooked in the first round, contrasting with the previous year's quarterback-heavy draft. This year's draft emphasized offensive and defensive lines, with only two quarterbacks selected in the first round, a departure from the quarterback-dominated selections of 2024.</p>

They cite Mangione's attempts to evade law enforcement and his expressed intent to target an entire industry as justification for seeking the death penalty.
