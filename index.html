            <p>China's science fiction industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by the popularity of novels like Liu Cixin’s 'The Three-Body Problem.' The industry generated approximately US$15 billion in revenue in 2024, marking a significant increase from previous years. This expansion is fueled by a growing interest in sci-fi books, TV series, and films among Chinese audiences, particularly younger generations. The Chinese government is actively supporting this growth, viewing the sci-fi market as a potential driver for consumption and 'quality' economic development.</p>

            <p>Andre Onana, Manchester United's goalkeeper, has been dropped from the squad to face Newcastle, with Altay Bayindir expected to take his place. Onana's performance has been under scrutiny since his £47m transfer from Inter Milan in 2023, marked by several errors leading to goals. His last appearance was in January, and he has faced both on-field struggles and off-field issues, including a mugging incident involving his wife. This decision reflects the club's response to his inconsistent form and provides an opportunity for Bayindir to prove his capabilities in a Premier League game.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is backing a recall campaign targeting opposition lawmakers in an effort to regain control of the legislature. This move aims to address legislative gridlock but risks deepening political divisions at a time when Taiwan faces pressure from Beijing. The DPP needs to unseat at least six district-based KMT legislators to reclaim a working majority, making the campaign a high-stakes political battle with potential implications for Taiwan's stability.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the implications of Donald Trump's tariff policies for Britain, particularly in the context of Brexit. It argues that Trump's actions demonstrate the futility of trying to 'cosy up' to him, as his policies undermine Britain's economic interests. The author suggests that Britain should instead focus on strengthening its relationship with the European Union and abandoning 'red lines' that hinder trade. The piece criticizes the average EU tariff on US goods as being more serious than Trump's policies.</p>
