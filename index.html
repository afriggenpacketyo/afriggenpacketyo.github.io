            <p>Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church known for his humility and outreach to diverse communities, passed away at the age of 88. Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced that Pope Francis returned to the house of the Father, dedicating his entire life to serving the Lord and His Church. The Pope had been hospitalized for over five weeks, initially for a respiratory tract infection that later developed into bilateral pneumonia. Pope Francis's papacy is remembered for its progressive stances and attempts to modernize the church. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100 and a multiple of 5.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, a case challenging the authority of the US Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF) to mandate insurance coverage for preventive care. Republican Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seemed inclined to vote against the challenge, suggesting that the PSTF's authority will likely be upheld. The case turns on whether the PSTF members are properly classified as "inferior officers" whose work is supervised by a Senate-confirmed official.</p>

More than half of Americans expect to outlive their savings, and retirement confidence has declined.

Analysts expect a significant improvement in sales compared with a year earlier, but the results are likely to be overshadowed by questions over the effect of tariffs on the business. The Trump administration has shown a “profound and hard-earned level of ignorance” of how the aerospace industry works.</p>
