          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has furloughed approximately 34,000 employees, nearly half of its workforce, due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. This action comes as the shutdown enters its eighth day with no resolution in sight after the Senate failed to pass funding bills. The agency announced that most of its operations are now closed, with only excepted and exempt employees remaining on the job. Furloughed workers are placed in a non-pay status until the government reopens, creating uncertainty for both employees and taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht, accusing him of intentionally starting the fire that grew into the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles County. The blaze, which killed a dozen people and destroyed thousands of structures, allegedly began from a smaller fire Rinderknecht set on New Year's Day that smoldered before erupting a week later. Digital evidence, including a concerning ChatGPT-generated image and a screen recording of him trying to call 911, played a key role in the investigation. He was arrested in Florida and faces federal charges for destruction of property by fire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has warned that a shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown, could lead to more flight delays across the United States. With controllers working without pay, there has been a slight increase in sick calls, straining an already thin workforce. This staffing issue has already caused the FAA to slow or halt arrivals at some airports. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association highlighted that many of its members are working long hours to maintain safety, raising concerns about the shutdown's growing impact on the aviation system.</p>

Al-Shamie was shot dead by police after killing two men in a car and knife attack. An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct is examining the circumstances of one victim's death, as he was fatally struck by a police bullet during the response. The attacker was also wearing a non-viable hoax explosive belt, and police are investigating his prior contact with law enforcement, including an allegation of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Republican Governors Association is investing an additional $1.5 million to support GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears in her Virginia gubernatorial race against Democrat Abigail Spanberger. This funding surge follows a controversy involving the Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, who sent violent texts about a Republican lawmaker in 2022. The Earle-Sears campaign is leveraging the incident to attack Spanberger's ticket, framing the election as a choice between "common sense versus violence."

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta, ending a multi-agency manhunt. Groves was found in the crawl space of a home after a brief standoff with a SWAT team. The escape, which occurred through a hole behind a toilet, highlighted significant security flaws at the facility, which the sheriff attributed to poor design and staffing issues. Groves, who was convicted of a 2024 double murder, will now face additional charges related to his escape, bringing what officials called "long-awaited calm" to the community.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has once again rejected competing Republican and Democratic proposals to fund the government, extending the ongoing shutdown into its eighth day with no clear resolution. Both a GOP-led stopgap bill and a Democratic-backed alternative failed to secure the necessary votes to advance. Republicans are seeking a short-term extension at current funding levels, while Democrats are pushing for additional healthcare funding. With both parties blaming each other for the impasse, the legislative stalemate continues, prolonging the disruption to federal services and the furlough of government workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow money, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is currently a much more affordable option than a credit card. The average interest rate for a credit card stands at 22.25%, whereas the median rate for a HELOC is just 7.89%, making credit cards over 180% more expensive. While both have variable rates that may decrease with future Federal Reserve cuts, the significant initial gap means HELOCs will remain the cheaper choice. Furthermore, the interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if used for home improvements, offering an additional financial advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration claims it is in a "non-international armed conflict" with cartels designated as terrorist groups.

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, a leap of more than 50% this year, reflecting growing investor anxiety.

          <p>The decision to redeploy NHS health visitors to other roles during the COVID-19 pandemic was "fundamentally flawed" and resulted in harm to children, the UK's Covid inquiry was told. Alison Morton of the Institute of Health Visiting testified that the move left some remaining staff with unmanageable caseloads and that virtual visits were inadequate, contributing to serious incidents and deaths. Cases like those of Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes were cited as examples of failures in child safeguarding. An NHS official acknowledged that services changed but maintained that safeguarding efforts did not stop during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>As the New Jersey gubernatorial race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli narrows, the state's Latino electorate is emerging as a key demographic that could decide the outcome. In 2024, President Trump made significant gains among Latino voters in several New Jersey districts, a trend Democrats are now working to reverse. National Latino advocacy group UnidosUS is endorsing Sherrill, aiming to mobilize voters on issues like housing and healthcare. The election is being watched nationally as a test of voter sentiment and whether Democrats can counter the GOP's recent inroads with this crucial voting bloc.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers looking for high returns should act now to lock in favorable rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs). While the peak rates of 6-7% are gone, competitive rates are still available, particularly for short-term CDs, with many offering yields around 4%. These rates are significantly higher than traditional savings accounts and provide a hedge against future rate declines. The article advises savers to explore online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions, to find the best terms before rates fall further.

          <p>France's outgoing interim Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, has stated that a new prime minister could be appointed within the next 48 hours. Lecornu resigned on Monday after just 14 hours in the role, citing a lack of cooperation among political parties that made forming a government impossible. He noted that President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reform was a major obstacle in negotiations. Lecornu, who was France's fifth prime minister in two years, also indicated that despite the political turmoil, there is little appetite among the majority in parliament for a snap election.</p>

          <p>This opinion article expresses concern over the appointment of Bari Weiss as the new editor in chief of CBS News, suggesting it could compromise the network's journalistic standards. The author argues that while Weiss's publication, The Free Press, initially challenged progressive orthodoxy, it has since failed to adequately critique the authoritarian tendencies of the Trump administration. The article posits that Weiss's focus on culture wars deflects from more pressing threats to democracy and that her appointment appears to be a concession to President Trump in exchange for regulatory approval of the Paramount-Skydance merger.</p>

Pat Beaird of Beaird Harris Wealth Management notes that while gold "glitters," it is the compounding of earnings from equities that builds wealth over time. Historical data shows that over a 30-year period, the S&P 500's annualized total return has significantly outpaced that of gold. While gold can serve as a safe-haven asset during periods of turmoil, advisors suggest its returns are not as reliable and recommend limiting its allocation in a diversified portfolio.

Unlike more common HECMs, these loans are offered by state or local agencies and are restricted to one approved use, such as paying property taxes or funding critical home repairs. This targeted approach typically results in lower fees and costs.
