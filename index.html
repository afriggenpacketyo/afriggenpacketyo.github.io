          <h2>Harvard Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Funding Freeze</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 01:09:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration to challenge a freeze on over $2.2 billion in federal grants. The lawsuit alleges that the administration's demands, including limiting activism on campus and altering admissions policies, infringe upon Harvard's First Amendment rights and violate the Civil Rights Act. Harvard President Alan Garber asserts that the university will not yield to these demands, framing the government's actions as an attack on the autonomy of American universities. The White House has responded by stating that taxpayer funds are a privilege, not a right, and that Harvard has failed to meet the basic conditions for accessing those funds.</p>

          <p>The new U.S. Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, conveyed his optimism regarding the ongoing tariff negotiations between the United States and Japan, anticipating a second round of discussions later in the month. During a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Glass emphasized the strong economic and friendly relationship between the two nations. Ishiba voiced his desire to fortify the alliance while jointly addressing global challenges. The talks occur amidst existing higher U.S. tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, as well as a 24 percent levy on Japanese goods, impacting the historically strong relationship.</p>

          <p>The sister of James Lee Williams, known as The Vivienne, revealed that the family only learned of his ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK. Williams, who died in January from cardiac arrest caused by ketamine, had kept his struggle a secret to protect his family. His sister, Chanel Williams, is now campaigning to encourage open conversations about substance abuse and advocating for the reclassification of ketamine as a Class A drug in the UK. The family hopes that sharing The Vivienne's story will help reduce the stigma surrounding addiction and encourage others to seek help.</p>

          <p>The UK government will release data revealing the nationalities of foreign criminals awaiting deportation, following pressure from the Conservative party. The latest figures indicate over 19,000 foreign offenders are awaiting deportation, a rise from previous years. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has instructed officials to publish the data by the end of the year, including the nationalities and crimes committed by these individuals. Government sources attribute the increase in foreign criminals awaiting deportation to early releases, instability in other countries, and appeals against deportation on human rights grounds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is presenting central banks worldwide with a complex challenge: whether to devalue their own currencies. The dollar index has fallen over 9% this year due to uncertainty surrounding U.S. policymaking, leading to appreciation of other currencies like the yen, franc, and euro. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness and could provoke retaliatory measures. Some analysts believe central banks will tread carefully to avoid capital flight and currency wars, while others suggest devaluation may be actively considered, particularly in emerging markets.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that ICE's actions were designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on sourcing products from China and selling to the U.S., are facing significant challenges due to increased tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The current 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese goods is putting pressure on profit margins, leading some businesses to raise prices or shift focus to other markets. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free, is expected to further impact the industry. This change means goods will now be subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item, increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline after President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump accused Powell of being a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates preemptively.

Investors are also seeking out safe-haven assets like gold, which hit a new record high. This market volatility comes amid ongoing concerns about tariffs and the potential for a recession.</p>
