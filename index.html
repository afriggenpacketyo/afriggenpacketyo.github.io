          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and left a 19-year-old hospitalized. The incident occurred during a new student orientation event when an 18-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire on a group playing video games in a dorm room. New Mexico State Police have taken the suspect into custody and are investigating the motive behind the attack. In response, the university closed its central campus as a precautionary measure and is offering counseling services to students and staff affected by the violence.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Tunis to protest against what they describe as President Kais Saied's increasingly authoritarian rule. The march, occurring four years after Saied dissolved parliament and assumed broad powers, featured chants calling for the regime's downfall and the release of political prisoners. Protesters argue that Tunisia has regressed into a state of fear, with journalists, activists, and opposition leaders being systematically jailed. Rights groups like Amnesty International have criticized the government for using vague legal charges to suppress dissent and dismantle the country's democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, constituting over 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program. This potential exodus would reduce its civil servant personnel from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The departures come as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and recent leadership instability, including a withdrawn nomination for its administrator. Despite the significant staff reduction, NASA has reiterated that safety remains its top priority as it aims to become a more streamlined organization.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that one of two hand grenades recovered from a Santa Monica townhome is missing following an explosion that killed three Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) confirmed that one grenade detonated on July 18 at a training academy while technicians were handling them. An extensive search for the second device has been unsuccessful, and the ATF is now leading the investigation into its origin and whereabouts. Sheriff Robert Luna has ordered an independent review of the department's explosive disposal protocols to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that the United Kingdom will participate in airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's approval for foreign countries to deliver supplies. This development comes amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis and increasing political pressure on the UK government, with over 200 MPs signing a letter urging the recognition of a Palestinian state. Starmer stated the government would do everything possible to deliver aid via this route, while also accelerating efforts to evacuate critically ill children from the region for medical treatment in the UK.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a historic mass recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The referendum could potentially shift control of the parliament to President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which lost its majority in the 2024 elections. The recall campaign was initiated by civic groups following controversial parliamentary reforms pushed by the KMT and its allies, which critics argue obstruct the government's agenda and favor China. The outcome is significant for Taiwan's domestic politics and its relationship with Beijing, which has been accused of attempting to interfere in the process.</p>

The suspension was enforced because both players missed the MLS All-Star game, which is a violation of league rules. Mas argued that the players and the club do not understand why missing an exhibition match warrants such a punishment, especially as the decision to sit out was made by the club to allow the players to rest. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision and stated the league will reevaluate the policy.</p>

The conflict began in 2022 when L'Oréal opposed her attempt to re-register the trademark for her business, 'nkd,' arguing it would cause confusion with its 'Naked' product line. Dowdeswell, who had held the trademark since 2009 but missed the renewal window during the COVID-19 pandemic, has spent over £30,000 fighting the opposition. She maintains there has been no consumer confusion in 15 years of trading and is determined to continue her fight against the global corporation.</p>

          <h2>Former Prosecutors Describe Justice Department's Interview with Ghislaine Maxwell as Unorthodox</h2>

          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have expressed bewilderment over Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's decision to personally interview convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, calling the move highly unorthodox and concerning. Experts noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge to assess credibility, not by high-ranking officials. The situation raises questions about the motivations behind the meeting, with some speculating it is a political maneuver to address public pressure regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files. The lack of an accompanying FBI agent to formally document the interview also breaks with standard Justice Department practice.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a sudden, dramatic plunge shortly after takeoff, injuring two flight attendants. The crew was responding to onboard traffic alerts that indicated a potential collision with another aircraft, identified as a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. Passengers described a terrifying experience, with some being lifted from their seats as the plane rapidly descended to avoid the other jet. The Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into the incident, which marks the second near-miss involving a commercial airliner in the U.S. within a week.</p>

          <p>This article explores the validity and flexibility of common health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. Experts offer varied perspectives, with some suggesting that strict adherence to numbers is less important than listening to one's body, for instance, drinking when thirsty. However, for goals like sleep, specialists assert that consistently getting seven to nine hours is vital for long-term health, reducing risks of obesity and depression. The consensus among experts is that while these benchmarks are useful guides, individuals should find a balanced, sustainable approach to incorporate healthy habits into their lives.</p>

He aims to challenge incumbent Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz, whom he accuses of prioritizing party politics over the needs of the community. Pulido, who studied political science before his music career, stated his desire to serve and address key issues like comprehensive immigration reform, the local economy, and affordable healthcare. He acknowledged that the Democratic party has been negligent in the district but hopes to run an issues-based campaign focused on the values of local Texans.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once considered taboo, such as the impact of the menstrual cycle on performance, the biomechanics of breasts and the importance of proper sports bras, and why female athletes have a higher risk for certain injuries like ACL tears. This shift marks a significant departure from the past, when female athletes were often treated as 'mini-men' in training and research. The new focus aims to improve performance, health, and injury prevention for women in sports.</p>

Such an event could create a visible flash from Earth and send a shower of high-speed lunar debris toward our planet, potentially damaging satellites in orbit. This scenario is prompting planetary defense experts to consider expanding their monitoring efforts to include threats to the moon and vital space infrastructure.</p>

While the boxes, containing items like pasta, lentils, and flour, provide sufficient calories for survival, experts consulted by BBC Verify warn of 'serious weaknesses.' The diet lacks essential micronutrients like iron, calcium, and various vitamins, which could lead to 'hidden hunger' and diseases like anemia and scurvy over time. The reliance on dried goods also presents a challenge, as cooking requires clean water and fuel, both of which are critically scarce in the besieged territory.</p>
