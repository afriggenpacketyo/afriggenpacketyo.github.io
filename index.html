          <p>An article explores the significant decline in cancer death rates in the US since 1991, attributing it to advancements in treatments, preventative measures, and reduced smoking rates. It highlights the story of Jon Gluck, a multiple myeloma survivor, as an example of how breakthroughs like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have transformed cancer from a death sentence to a manageable condition. The article also discusses the impact of the HPV vaccine on cervical cancer rates and the importance of early screening in improving survival chances. These advancements represent a revolution in cancer treatment, offering hope and a welcome uncertainty for patients. Optimism among patients and doctors has grown exponentially over the past two decades.</p>

          <p>A former police chief and convicted killer, Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison.

Russia, initially lacking in drone technology, has partnered with Iran to produce its own arsenal, leading to a drone arms race where both countries are mass-producing and deploying drones in large numbers.</p>

          <p>An article explores whether drawing down a 401(k) to delay Social Security benefits is a wise financial move. While delaying Social Security can increase monthly benefits, the opportunity cost of forgoing 401(k) investment growth is a crucial factor. The analysis suggests considering factors like market returns and the size of one's nest egg before deciding. For some, taking Social Security early and continuing to grow their investments may yield a higher total payout (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A timeline details the events surrounding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. Despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, Garcia was deported by the Trump administration, who claimed he was a member of MS-13. After legal battles and a Supreme Court ruling, Garcia was eventually brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges. The timeline outlines the series of administrative errors, legal proceedings, and political interventions that marked this case.</p>

          <p>An article examines the debate over time limits on federal rental aid, using Delaware's program as a case study. The Delaware State Housing Authority imposes a seven-year time limit but also provides support services and savings accounts to help tenants achieve self-sufficiency. While time limits have not worked well everywhere, Delaware's approach, which includes financial incentives and support, has shown some success. Housing policy experts debate whether such limits can be scaled nationally, especially given the shortage of affordable housing.</p>
