          <p>Comcast's Q2 financial results surpassed Wall Street forecasts for both earnings and revenue, driven partly by the sale of its Hulu stake to Disney. Despite this positive performance, the company experienced a significant loss of 226,000 broadband customers, highlighting ongoing challenges in the connectivity market. In contrast, its mobile division saw record growth, adding 378,000 new lines, while the theme parks and film studios also reported strong revenue increases. The company's streaming service, Peacock, saw its losses narrow considerably, though subscriber numbers remained flat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is scheduled to review the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The case follows a lower court ruling that found the president lacked the authority, a decision the administration is now appealing. Challengers, including 12 states and several small businesses, argue the tariffs exceed presidential power and violate constitutional doctrines. The Trump administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address national emergencies like trade deficits and illicit drug flows. (not investment advice)</p>

This finding represents the deepest known chemosynthesis-based community on Earth, where life is sustained not by sunlight but by chemical reactions involving methane and hydrogen sulphide. The discovery challenges existing models of life at extreme environmental limits and deep-ocean carbon cycling. Researchers suggest that such hidden oases of life might be more common in the world's hadal trenches than previously believed.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is warning the UK government in England to improve nurse pay or face potential industrial action in the autumn. A survey of over 170,000 members revealed that 91% believe the recent 3.6% pay increase is insufficient, with the union calling the award "grotesque" compared to raises for doctors. The RCN is seeking urgent discussions to reform the NHS pay structure, arguing that too many experienced nurses remain on the lowest pay bands. This dissatisfaction highlights a feeling of being undervalued and could lead to a formal strike ballot if the government does not engage.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the Cincinnati Bengals, arguing that their window to win a Super Bowl with quarterback Joe Burrow is rapidly closing due to front office shortcomings. Despite Burrow's elite talent, the franchise has been criticized for mismanaging draft picks, failing to adequately protect him with a strong offensive line, and retaining a coaching staff that has not maximized the team's potential. The piece contends that by retaining the same core roster and making minimal changes, the team is banking on Burrow to single-handedly overcome deficiencies in a highly competitive AFC.</p>

          <p>An Indian court has acquitted Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, a Hindu nationalist nun and former member of parliament, along with six other individuals, in a deadly 2008 bombing case. The attack, which involved a bomb on a motorcycle exploding near a mosque in Malegaon, killed six people and injured over 100. The judge ruled that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the charges of terrorism and criminal conspiracy against the accused. The verdict has been called "disappointing" by critics, who allege the investigation was deliberately shoddy.</p>

          <p>An issue with the UK's air traffic control system on Wednesday caused significant disruption at all UK airports, leading to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounding thousands more. The provider, NATS, apologized and stated the radar-related problem was resolved within an hour by switching to a backup system. However, the knock-on effects are expected to last for days during the peak summer travel season, as airlines struggle to reposition aircraft, crew, and stranded passengers. The Transport Secretary confirmed the incident was isolated and not due to malicious activity.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows a Widening Gap Between Democratic Voters and Party Leaders on Israel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant shift in public opinion has occurred among Democratic voters, who now show far more sympathy for Palestinians than for Israelis, a stark reversal from just a few years ago. This article analyzes the growing disconnect between the Democratic base and the party's establishment leaders, who have largely maintained staunch support for Israel. Despite voter sentiment, actions like congressional approval of military aid and meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu persist. The influence of powerful lobbying groups like AIPAC and political inertia are cited as key reasons for this gap.</p>

          <p>Former NFL star and prominent sports commentator Shannon Sharpe will not be returning to ESPN, a departure that follows the settlement of a lawsuit filed against him. The case was brought by a woman who accused Sharpe of sexual assault during their relationship, seeking over $50 million in damages. While Sharpe denied the claims, the case was settled and dismissed earlier this month with undisclosed terms. In a podcast, Sharpe confirmed his exit from the network, where he had not appeared since the lawsuit was filed in April, expressing regret over the timing of the news.</p>

          <h2>Explainer on Tariffs: How They Function and Why the Trump Administration Employs Them</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a fundamental explanation of tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods, and details how they are being used as a key tool in President Trump's trade policy. The administration argues that tariffs protect American jobs and manufacturing by making foreign goods more expensive, thereby encouraging the purchase of domestic products. However, the policy has created chaos in the global economy and led some companies to pass the extra costs on to U.S. consumers. The piece outlines the various tariffs implemented against specific goods and countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, is investigating four companies that operate a total of 34 pornography websites for potential non-compliance with new age verification rules. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, require sites with adult content to use effective tools to prevent children from accessing it. The targeted companies have a combined monthly viewership of over nine million visitors and were prioritized based on user numbers and the potential risk of harm. This move is part of a broader enforcement effort by Ofcom to make the internet safer for children.</p>

          <p>Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from his position amid mounting pressure from investigations into his past and current business dealings. The resignation, announced by President Gitanas Nauseda, also includes Paluckas stepping down as head of the Social Democratic party. The probes were initiated after media reports detailed alleged misconduct, including links to a past conviction for abuse of power. Paluckas has denied any wrongdoing, calling the scrutiny a "coordinated attack," but resigned before facing potential impeachment proceedings, creating political uncertainty for the coalition government.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that a majority of the over 109,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first five months of President Trump's second term occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida and California. Overall, ICE arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period in the previous year under the Biden administration. This trend reflects the Trump administration's sweeping mandate for the agency to carry out a large-scale deportation effort.</p>
