          <p>U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin are approaching their Alaska summit with distinct goals regarding the war in Ukraine. Putin seeks international recognition and validation of Russia's territorial claims, using the meeting to signal an end to Western isolation. Conversely, Trump aims to position himself as a global peacemaker, potentially earning a Nobel Peace Prize, though his vacillating statements make his exact strategy unpredictable. The summit's location in Alaska is symbolic for Russia, highlighting historical ties and providing a venue to deal directly with the U.S., sidelining European leaders.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his significant loss in the 2022 election. Prosecutors argued Peña acted on the baseless belief that the election was "rigged" and sought to intimidate political opponents, though no one was injured in the shootings. Peña maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the conviction, which his lawyers attribute to the testimony of co-conspirators who accepted plea deals.</p>

          <p>Shares of Intel increased by 7% following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in the semiconductor company. This potential investment aims to bolster domestic chip manufacturing, a key priority for the administration, and would help fund new Intel factories in Ohio. The move is part of a broader trend of increased government involvement in key industries to enhance U.S. technological independence and national security. While Intel has not confirmed the discussions, the news provided a significant boost to its stock, which has been recovering from a difficult previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a similar effort by Texas Republicans to gain political advantage. Newsom's move aims to create up to five new Democratic-leaning districts to offset potential GOP gains in Texas, setting up a high-stakes political battle ahead of the midterm elections. Because California's constitution mandates an independent commission for redistricting, the process will be complex, likely requiring a voter-approved constitutional amendment. The governor framed the action as a necessary countermeasure to what he described as President Trump's attempt to "rig the system."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed a Mississippi law restricting minors' access to social media to take effect, but a concurring opinion from Justice Brett Kavanaugh reveals underlying complexities. Kavanaugh suggested the law is likely unconstitutional but voted with the majority because the plaintiffs failed to show "irreparable harm," a standard from the Court's "shadow docket" procedures. This analysis points to an inconsistency, as this standard has often been ignored in cases involving the Trump administration, suggesting a special set of rules may apply to the former president. Kavanaugh's opinion also signals that broader First Amendment protections for speech, outside of pornography, likely remain secure for now.</p>

This strategic shift has effectively sidelined American farmers during their peak selling season, reflecting Beijing's increasing trade reliance on South America amid ongoing tensions with Washington. Traders report that China has already secured about half of its projected demand for these months from South American sources. The move is expected to keep downward pressure on global soybean prices, which are already near five-year lows.</p>

          <p>Under new orders from Chief Pamela Smith, Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department will expand its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The policy change allows local officers to share information about individuals not in police custody and to transport federal agents and detainees. This marks a significant shift from the city's previous "sanctuary" policies, which limited such collaboration, and comes after President Trump placed the D.C. police under direct federal control. While D.C. law still prevents police from inquiring about immigration status or arresting individuals solely for being in the U.S. illegally, the new order deepens the ties between local and federal enforcement.</p>

This has temporarily buffered consumers from inflation, but as this inventory is sold, higher prices are expected to reach retail shelves, particularly for holiday season goods.

However, Trump's tone has recently soured as the war has dragged on, leading him to approve weapons for Ukraine and threaten sanctions.

The "shop-in-shop" concept was launched in 2021 and was often highlighted by Target as a key strategy to drive store traffic and boost its beauty category sales. The dissolution of the deal could be a setback for Target, which has faced challenges with flat sales and declining store traffic. Analysts suggest that operational issues at Target, including staffing and theft, may have contributed to the decision to end the popular and once-promising collaboration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors convened a grand jury and attempted to force Del Richardson, the wife of City Councilman Curren Price, to testify in the corruption case against him. Price faces charges of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest, stemming from allegations that he voted on matters that financially benefited his wife's consulting firm. Newly public documents also reveal that Richardson herself was considered a "suspect" in the investigation as recently as 2022, though she was not charged. Price's attorney has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, questioning the legality and purpose of the secret grand jury proceedings.</p>

          <p>German soccer champion Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" shirt sponsorship deal, citing a "strategic evolution" rather than directly addressing human rights concerns. The club had faced significant pressure from fans and activists over its commercial ties to Rwanda, whose government is accused of funding the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While the prominent branding will be removed, Bayern will maintain a relationship with the country by focusing on youth football development through its academy in Kigali. Experts suggest the move was forced by public criticism, highlighting the complex intersection of sports, finance, and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>Data analytics and AI software company Palantir has experienced a phenomenal surge since its 2020 public listing, with its stock growing over 1,700%. A significant driver of this growth has been its lucrative contracts with the U.S. government, particularly the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company recently surpassed a $430 billion market valuation, a figure that dwarfs many tech giants with far greater revenues, reflecting immense investor confidence in its AI capabilities. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, the company's high valuation has led to a premium stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

This reversal is partly attributed to the increasing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by a significantly higher proportion of boys and tend to yield more top grades. While more girls take A-levels overall, the gender divide in subject choice, particularly the growing dominance of boys in mathematics, appears to have influenced the overall results. Meanwhile, subjects in the arts and humanities have seen a continued decline in popularity among students.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, writer Rebecca Solnit condemns President Trump's decision to place Washington, D.C. under federal control as a hypocritical and authoritarian power grab. Solnit argues the move is based on false pretenses about crime, noting that violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low, and draws a parallel to the January 6th insurrection, which she calls the city's most violent day. She posits that the action fits a broader right-wing agenda to demonize and control diverse, Democratic-leaning urban centers. The author frames the takeover as a manufactured drama intended to assert control and distract from other political issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's move to place the Washington, D.C. police under federal control is legally possible due to the capital's unique status as a federal district, not a state. Under the 1973 Home Rule Act, the president can assume control during emergencies, and as commander-in-chief, also commands the D.C. National Guard. Legal experts explain that replicating this action in other cities like Chicago or Los Angeles would be far more difficult, as state governors command their own National Guards. While the president can deploy federal forces to protect federal property, using them for domestic law enforcement is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act, making a similar takeover elsewhere legally and politically challenging.</p>

          <p>The concept of "genius" has long fascinated society, yet its definition remains elusive and has shifted significantly over time. Originally referring to a person's guiding spirit, the term evolved in the 19th century to describe individuals with extraordinary, seemingly inexplicable talent. This shift coincided with scientific attempts to explain genius through heredity, leading to the problematic field of eugenics, which often carried racial biases. The article argues that proclaiming someone a genius is deeply subjective, and that historical context, social conditions, and sheer luck play a crucial role in success, complicating any simple definition based on innate ability alone.</p>
