          <p>Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon, Jimmy Lai, awaits a verdict in his national security trial after closing arguments. Arrested in 2020, Lai faces potential life imprisonment for charges including "colluding with foreign forces" and "publishing seditious materials" through his now-closed Apple Daily newspaper. The defense argues his actions were free speech, while prosecutors cite articles and public comments as evidence of foreign intervention. This high-profile case highlights a significant erosion of press freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong, drawing international condemnation and concern for Lai's health.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against the Donald Trump administration, challenging her recent dismissal. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, alleges Trump's attempt to remove her violates federal law, which permits firing only "for cause." Trump cited allegations of improper mortgage funds, which Cook denies and argues occurred before her Fed confirmation. This unprecedented legal battle raises significant concerns about the US central bank's independence from political interference.</p>

          <p>Google has eliminated more than 35% of its managers overseeing small teams in the past year, as the company prioritizes efficiency and reduced bureaucracy. This reduction primarily affected managers with fewer than three direct reports, many of whom transitioned to individual contributor roles. CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the need for Google to scale without relying solely on increased headcount, following previous layoffs and buyouts. While the company's stock has performed well, these changes have sparked employee questions about job security and morale.</p>
