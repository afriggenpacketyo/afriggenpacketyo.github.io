          <h2>Trump Hints at Potential Tariff Reduction on Chinese Goods Amid Trade Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:39:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested a possible reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% ahead of trade talks in Switzerland, a shift from the previously announced tariffs of up to 145%. The upcoming meeting marks the first publicly acknowledged discussion between the U.S. and China since the trade war intensified, with China claiming the U.S. initiated the talks. Analysts suggest that a reduction to 50%-60% is expected, and failure to meet these expectations could negatively impact markets. UBS analysts anticipate tariffs settling around 34%, indicating a constructive tone for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing at an ICE detention center while protesting its operations, accompanied by three Democratic members of Congress. Baraka and city officials allege the facility opened without proper permits and blocked necessary inspections, while the firm operating the detention center claims to have the required permits. Videos show a confrontation between protesters and officers, leading to Baraka's arrest after warnings. New Jersey's Governor Phil Murphy expressed outrage over the arrest, as federal agencies continue their crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British artists are urging the Prime Minister to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to protect their copyrighted works from being used to train AI models without transparency. They propose an amendment by Baroness Beeban Kidron, requiring developers to disclose the use of copyrighted material, which they believe is crucial for establishing fair licensing agreements. While the government acknowledges the concerns and is consulting on measures, some critics argue that restrictive copyright regimes could hinder the UK's AI development and harm the economy.

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction in 1972, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, is likely to survive the atmospheric dive, with potential debris reaching the surface. Despite the uncertainty, the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low, and any recovered pieces legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced the annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels along the West Coast from Oregon to the Mexican border, effective through October 31. The quarantine warns against consuming mussels due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. These toxins accumulate in mussels during algae blooms, making them dangerous to eat, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the risk. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to frequent testing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that left-handedness and mixed-handedness may be associated with certain psychiatric and psychological conditions, particularly those affecting language or neurodevelopment, such as schizophrenia, autism, and ADHD. Researchers analyzed data from over 200,000 individuals and found that people with autism are 3.5 times more likely to be left-handed. While the study identifies a correlation, it does not establish causation, and experts caution against drawing conclusions that being left-handed implies a person will develop these disorders. The findings may offer insights into brain organization and development, potentially aiding in neurorehabilitation.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail their constitutional right to challenge detention in court. Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing that the U.S. faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and that a president cannot do so unilaterally. This consideration follows a series of actions by the administration to limit due process for immigrants.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods have significantly impacted the Port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the Western Hemisphere, with traffic down by a third compared to last year. The decline translates to fewer ships, containers, and jobs, affecting lorry drivers and related industries. A shortage of certain items imported from China and price hikes are taking hold, with businesses in Los Angeles' toy district already feeling the strain. The U.S. trade secretary is scheduled to meet with his Chinese counterpart to address the growing pressure to strike a deal.</p>

          <p>The US and China are set to begin trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since President Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods. Despite previous fiery rhetoric, both sides have signaled a willingness to break the deadlock, though neither wants to appear to be backing down. The tariffs have impacted both economies, with China's factory output taking a hit and the US facing uncertainty and rising consumer costs. The talks aim to reassure nervous markets and domestic constituencies, but the outcome remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs under the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security interests.

Tariffs could harm the aerospace industry, which relies on global suppliers and has a large trade surplus.

          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a constitutional right to challenge the legality of detention. Miller cited the Constitution allowing suspension during invasion, arguing the U.S. faces an "invasion" of undocumented migrants. The decision depends on courts "doing the right thing," implying judges should not block deportation efforts. The writ has been suspended only four times since the Constitution's ratification, usually with Congressional authorization.</p>
