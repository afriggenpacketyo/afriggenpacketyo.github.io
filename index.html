          <p>Thomas Barrack, the new U.S. envoy to Syria, made his first official visit to Damascus, signaling a warming of relations between the two countries after over a decade of strained ties. Appointed by President Trump shortly after the President lifted sanctions on Syria, Barrack raised the American flag over the U.S. ambassador’s residence and met with Syrian officials, urging them to normalize relations with Israel. Shortly after the visit, Syria’s energy ministry signed a $7 billion investment deal with a Qatari-based company to help rebuild the country's war-torn infrastructure, which Barrack credited to the lifting of U.S. sanctions. Barrack also indicated the Trump administration would remove Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump at the White House, where he emphasized that the central bank's monetary policy decisions would be based on objective, non-political analysis. This meeting occurred amidst Trump's repeated calls for lower interest rates, which he believes would give the U.S. an economic advantage over countries like China. The Fed confirmed that Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, but stressed that future policy would depend entirely on incoming economic information. Markets largely expect the Fed to hold steady on rates until there's more clarity on tariff uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White revealed she was fined by the WNBA after expressing her thoughts on officiating, particularly following a game where Caitlin Clark suffered a quad injury. White had questioned the consistency of officiating and whether the league wanted a free-flowing offensive game or a tough, physical one. She also noted a significant free throw discrepancy in recent games, feeling her team was not getting the respect it deserved. The coach did not elaborate on the specific comments that led to the fine, but it likely stemmed from her remarks after a loss to the New York Liberty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering asking the U.S. Supreme Court to immediately pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs. This action follows a ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade that invalidated dozens of country-specific tariffs imposed earlier this year. The administration argues that the ruling undermines the president's authority to address national emergencies and threatens national security and economic interests. White House officials have criticized the judges, accusing them of abusing their power and threatening the credibility of the United States on the world stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to projections from industry tracker IWSR, non-alcoholic beer is on track to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category by volume worldwide this year. While overall beer volume decreased slightly in 2024, the non-alcoholic segment experienced a 9% growth. This trend is driven by more consumers, particularly younger generations, moderating their alcohol consumption and brewers investing in better-tasting zero-proof alternatives. Lager remains the dominant beer category, but non-alcoholic beer's increasing popularity is fueled by brands like Athletic Brewing and celebrity-backed ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration's efforts to restrict Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The move comes after the same judge granted a temporary restraining order last Friday, and aims to maintain the status quo while the legal process continues. Harvard has nearly 7,000 international students, who make up more than a quarter of the student body, and the ability to enroll these students represents a crucial financial lifeline for the university. The ruling provides some temporary relief for international students, but the legal battle is ongoing.</p>

Participants expressed disdain for Republicans who deviate from the party line, including members of the House Freedom Caucus and moderate senators. They reserved particular criticism for Senator Mitch McConnell, whom they viewed as an obstructionist to Trump's agenda. These perspectives underscore the pressure on Republican lawmakers to align with the president, even if it means setting aside personal reservations.</p>

The testimony supports allegations that Combs subjected women to forced labor through violence and threats, as part of a broader racketeering conspiracy.

          <p>Dangerous wildfires in Manitoba, Canada, have led to a state of emergency and the evacuation of 17,000 people. The Canadian Armed Forces are being deployed to assist in evacuations and firefighting efforts. Many evacuees will be housed in sports venues and community centers in Winnipeg and other cities. Smoke from the wildfires is expected to drift south, triggering air quality alerts in Minnesota and potentially reaching cities like Minneapolis, Detroit, and Chicago. Climate change is linked to the worsening wildfire seasons, with Canada warming at twice the global average.</p>

Witnesses described scenes of horror as the car struck and tossed people into the air. Doyle is also charged with dangerous driving, and police said they believed Doyle dodged a road block by tailing an ambulance.</p>

The housing crisis, compounded by the decision to reopen West Maui to tourists, heightened male rage and fueled domestic violence.
