          <p>President Trump stated that his administration plans to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals, potentially starting small and escalating to 250% within 18 months. The goal is to incentivize drug companies to move manufacturing back to the U.S., a move the pharmaceutical industry warns could increase costs and disrupt supply chains. This threat is part of a broader strategy to lower drug prices, which also includes the "most favored nation" policy aimed at tying U.S. drug prices to lower international costs.

The decision to seek more information punts a final ruling to the fall, leaving the disputed map in place for now. This case highlights the ongoing, politically charged battles over redistricting in several states ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A CBS News review of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative found that its claimed cost savings are significantly overstated. The analysis focused on three large contract cancellations from the Department of Health and Human Services, which DOGE claimed saved $6.4 billion. However, the review indicates the actual savings are closer to $165 million, representing unspent obligated funds rather than the total potential value of the contracts, which was unlikely to be reached.

          <p>Tennessee proceeded with the execution of Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, despite legal challenges and concerns about his implanted heart defibrillator. His attorneys argued the device could cause unnecessary pain during the lethal injection, but the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to deactivate it. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two daughters, and his execution marks the second in Tennessee since a five-year pause.</p>
