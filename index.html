          <p>SoftBank Group has announced its second straight quarter of profit, exceeding market expectations with a reported 421.8 billion yen for the first fiscal quarter. The positive performance was primarily driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its technology-focused Vision Fund segment, which itself posted a profit of 451.4 billion yen. This financial upswing occurs as the Japanese conglomerate continues its significant investments in artificial intelligence, including a major funding round for OpenAI and the proposed acquisition of chip designer Ampere Computing. The report highlights a recovery for the firm, which recently posted its first annual profit in four years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, which would mark its lowest point since March 2023. This anticipated move is intended to lower borrowing costs, potentially reducing mortgage payments for some homeowners but offering lower returns for savers. The decision comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation, with no growth recorded in April and May, and as inflation climbed to 3.6% in June. Economists suggest that while further cuts may be forthcoming, the central bank will likely proceed with caution in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry, citing a strong harvest and stabilizing market conditions. A bumper crop, particularly in Spain, has helped lower raw material prices by 50%, allowing for reduced shelf prices and stimulating consumer demand. This marks a significant turnaround from a recent crisis caused by poor yields, extreme weather, and high inflation, which led to record-high prices. The company now anticipates a more balanced market and is doubling its investment in advertising to reinforce olive oil's status as a staple. (not investment advice)</p>

These tariffs, which took effect Thursday, range from 10% to over 40% and are being applied to major trading partners like the EU, Japan, and South Korea. While the administration expresses confidence that the tariffs will boost domestic investment and manufacturing, some economic indicators since the initial announcement in April show stalled hiring and rising inflation. Critics, including former House Speaker Paul Ryan, have expressed skepticism, anticipating legal challenges and economic turbulence ahead.</p>

          <p>A broad set of new tariffs championed by President Trump went into effect Thursday, impacting a wide array of U.S. trading partners with higher import duties. The levies vary significantly by country, with some of the highest rates applied to Syria (41%), Laos (40%), and Switzerland (39%). Additionally, Brazil and India now face duties of 50%, with the administration citing India's purchases of Russian oil as a key reason for its increased rate. The implementation follows a last-minute adjustment and delay from an original August 1 deadline, marking a significant escalation in global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A 62-year-old British man visiting Florida has been arrested and charged with attempted second-degree murder after allegedly trying to drown his daughter-in-law in a swimming pool.

According to the Polk County Sheriff's Office, the man held the 33-year-old victim's head underwater multiple times. He allegedly stopped only after neighbors intervened and called the police, and the victim's nine-year-old daughter jumped into the pool to help her mother.</p>

Imports also saw their largest increase in a year, rising 4.1% and suggesting a recovery in domestic demand. This economic strength comes as a U.S. tariff truce deadline approaches, with analysts noting that businesses may be front-loading shipments to avoid potential new duties. Despite the overall positive numbers, exports to the U.S. continued to decline, a trend offset by increased trade with markets in Southeast Asia and the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent increase of U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a multibillion-dollar blow to India's economy, according to market analysis. The new duties, imposed over India's oil trade with Russia, make certain export-reliant sectors particularly vulnerable, including gems, jewelry, apparel, and chemicals. While IT services and pharmaceuticals are not currently targeted, the tariffs are expected to weaken the Indian rupee and increase currency volatility. The duties are set to take effect in 21 days, a window that some economists believe may provide an opportunity for negotiation and a potential off-ramp. (not investment advice)</p>

The article questions the decision to involve a celebrity artist in such a sensitive project, suggesting the work is banal and risks turning the memorial into an empty symbol.</p>

          <p>United Airlines has lifted a nationwide ground stop that was implemented due to a significant technology issue, causing extensive delays at major hubs like Chicago O'Hare. The airline stated that the problem, which began Wednesday evening, has been resolved, though residual delays are expected as normal operations are restored. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the issue was internal to United and not related to the broader air traffic control system. United is treating the disruption as a preventable delay, indicating they will cover customer expenses like hotels where applicable.</p>

          <p>An intense and deadly wildfire, described by authorities as the largest in the region in nearly 80 years, is raging through the Corbieres hills in southwestern France. The blaze has already consumed 16,000 hectares, resulted in one death, and injured at least 13 people, including nine firefighters. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by aircraft and helicopters, are battling the flames, but officials do not expect to bring it under control soon due to forecasted high temperatures and strong winds. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called the fire a "catastrophe of unprecedented scale" linked to global warming and drought.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking new study from Harvard Medical School suggests that the element lithium, commonly used as a mood stabilizer, may play a crucial role in brain health and protection against Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that lithium is naturally present in the body and essential for normal cell function. In experiments with mice, maintaining normal lithium levels protected them from brain changes associated with Alzheimer's, while depleting it accelerated the disease's hallmarks, like plaque buildup and memory loss. The findings could pave the way for new diagnostic tests and treatments for the neurodegenerative disorder.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on imported computer chips and semiconductors, a move that would likely increase the cost of numerous consumer goods. However, the plan includes a significant exemption for companies that are currently building or have committed to building manufacturing facilities in the United States. The announcement was made during a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, where a new $100 billion U.S. investment by the tech giant was discussed. This tariff strategy marks a departure from the incentive-based approach of the 2022 CHIPS Act.</p>

The comedy show, which recently lampooned the president, responded with a sarcastic post questioning its own relevance.

The positive data has led some economists to predict that China is on track to meet its 5% GDP growth target for the year. Major stocks like Alibaba Group Holding and ZTO Express saw significant rallies ahead of their interim earnings reports. (not investment advice)</p>

The article points out that while plastic pollution in oceans and its presence in blood and placentas are known issues, the confirmation of microplastics in male reproductive organs, with evidence suggesting reduced sperm counts, should galvanize action. It criticizes the petrochemical lobby for obstructing progress on a global plastic pollution treaty. The author urges for greater awareness and a shift away from single-use plastics to address this pervasive health and environmental crisis.</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have scrapped a major $3 billion coastal restoration project designed to rebuild the state's rapidly eroding wetlands. The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion aimed to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to naturally rebuild thousands of acres of marshland, which serves as a critical buffer against hurricane storm surge. The project was canceled at the direction of Governor Jeff Landry following strong opposition from local fishing communities who feared it would destroy their industry. Coastal scientists argue that without such large-scale, systemic projects, Louisiana's coast and its culture face an unsustainable future.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's ministry sent a letter requesting more information about the blacked-out drawings, which has intensified existing security concerns. Opponents of the plan fear the embassy's proximity to London's financial district could pose an espionage risk, while others worry about potential harassment of political dissidents. The move comes as Rayner's office takes over the final planning decision from the local council.</p>
