            <p>Japan's export growth in March rose by 3.9% year-on-year, falling short of economists' expectations of 4.5% and lower than February's 11.4% increase. The growth was highest to the Middle East, rising by 17.1%, while exports to the U.S. saw a modest 3.1% increase. The data doesn't fully reflect the impact of U.S. tariffs on auto imports, steel, and aluminum, although reciprocal tariffs have been temporarily suspended. The trade data surfaces amidst ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S., with discussions covering tariffs, military support costs, and trade fairness. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs. The lawsuit argues that Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact tariffs is unlawful and requires Congressional approval. Newsom stated that California would be disproportionately impacted by the tariffs, leading to inflated costs and billions in damages, as it is a major exporter of goods. The lawsuit marks California's 14th legal challenge against the Trump administration in less than 14 weeks.</p>

Experts acknowledge rising diagnoses and potential environmental factors but attribute much of the increase to broadened diagnostic criteria.

            <p>The White House has asserted that Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, will "never" live in the United States again. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated accusations that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang, despite his lawyer's denial. The Trump administration's refusal to return Ábrego García comes amid escalating tensions between the president and the judiciary on immigration. Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen was denied access to visit Ábrego García in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>After actress Aimee Lou Wood criticized a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her with exaggerated prosthetic teeth, comedians are discussing the line between funny and offensive. The sketch, a parody of 'The White Lotus', depicted Wood's character with a pronounced accent and large teeth. Some comedians argue the sketch was a 'cheap shot', while others believe those in the public eye should expect to be mocked. The debate highlights the challenges of caricature and the evolving sensitivities around impressions.</p>

            <p>The search for life on other planets is intensifying, with scientists developing advanced instruments to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets for biosignatures. Recent discoveries, such as the detection of a gas on planet K2-18b, have fueled excitement about the possibility of finding alien life. Future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory and the ExoMars rover, aim to further investigate the potential for life beyond Earth. The discovery of extraterrestrial life could have profound implications for humanity's understanding of its place in the universe.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles County officials are considering doubling misdemeanor fines for individuals involved in street takeovers, including spectators, from $500 to $1,000. The measure aims to deter the illegal events, which often result in damaged vehicles and injuries. The county also plans to urge social media platforms to remove and demonetize posts promoting street takeovers. The number of street takeovers has decreased in most areas of the county, but has increased in Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell's district.</p>

            <p>Residents of Chelsea, Michigan, formed a human chain to move 9,100 books from Serendipity Books' old location to a new storefront. About 300 people participated in the "book brigade," passing books one-by-one along the sidewalk. The effort took just under two hours, with volunteers even alphabetizing the books on the shelves. The bookstore has been in Chelsea since 1997, and the move was seen as a community-building event.</p>

            <p>Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life. A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms. The team has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.</p>

            <p>Chinese carmakers, including BYD and Geely Auto, are facing delays in their plans to build overseas production facilities due to security and geopolitical concerns raised by Beijing. Authorities are reportedly cautioning the EV producers about trade and investment risks arising from policies pursued by the U.S. government. Beijing's intervention suggests a more cautious and strategic approach to overseas expansion, favoring countries with more favorable geopolitical relationships with China. This trend has already impacted other Chinese EV companies.</p>

            <p>Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among Latinas, who are often not screened early enough due to cultural, systemic, and environmental factors. Dense breasts, common among women, increase the risk of undetected cancer on mammograms. Legislation requiring notification of breast density exists in many states, but the information often remains unknown or misunderstood. Experts advocate for more open communication about health within Latina communities and increased research funding to address health disparities.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration proposed a rule to redefine "harm" under the Endangered Species Act, limiting it to direct actions that kill or injure protected species. Conservationists argue this would remove protections against habitat destruction and significantly curtail the act's reach. The proposal contradicts a 1995 Supreme Court ruling that included habitat modification in the definition of harm. The change is part of a broader effort to promote economic growth by reducing environmental regulations.</p>
