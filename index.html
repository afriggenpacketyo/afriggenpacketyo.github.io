          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle continued to strengthen, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and is forecast to reach hurricane status by Sunday. The storm is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, bringing dangerous surf, large swells, and life-threatening rip currents, though no direct watches or warnings are currently in effect for the island. While the Atlantic hurricane season was predicted to be busier, activity has been notably quieter than anticipated, with only one prior named storm making U.S. landfall. Forecasters are also closely monitoring a weak tropical wave off the west coast of Africa for potential development and its uncertain path.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team from multiple universities has discovered 41 new landslides on the moon since 2009, which they attribute to moonquakes. Published in the National Science Review, these findings challenge the long-held conventional wisdom that the moon's internal geological activity had essentially ceased. The discovery, made by meticulously comparing before-and-after images of the moon's least stable areas, highlights previously unexplored geological hazards. This groundbreaking research offers crucial insights for assessing the stability of future permanent infrastructures and deep-space outposts on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>President Trump nominated senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the resignation of Erik Siebert. Trump lauded Halligan, his former attorney during the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation, as a "tough, smart, and loyal attorney" capable of delivering "JUSTICE FOR ALL!" This appointment occurs amidst significant political pressure from the administration to criminally charge New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Siebert's departure was reportedly due to his refusal to comply with this pressure, though Trump asserted he fired him.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, one of his former defense attorneys, to lead a crucial federal prosecutor's office in Virginia. This decision follows the resignation of Erik Siebert, the previous head of the office, who reportedly faced pressure from the Trump administration to pursue a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Halligan, who lacks prosecutorial experience, was previously involved in Trump's legal team and a White House initiative to remove "anti-American ideology" from Smithsonian museums. Trump publicly criticized Siebert, claiming he fired him for receiving Democratic support.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a series of bills aimed at curbing federal immigration enforcement, including the "No Secret Police Act" (SB 627), which bans federal and local law enforcement from wearing face coverings on duty and mandates identification. These new laws, effective January 1st, 2026, also protect children at schools and individuals in non-public hospital areas from immigration operations without judicial warrants. Newsom framed these measures as a stand against the Trump administration's "authoritarian tendencies," while Department of Homeland Security officials condemned them as "despicable" and a threat to officers.</p>

          <p>Indian-controlled Kashmir, like many major Indian cities, is facing a significant challenge with its large stray dog population, leading to thousands of bite cases annually. In Srinagar alone, over 6,000 dog bites were reported last year, prompting the municipal authority to launch an ambitious drive to catch and sterilize over 21,000 stray dogs by the end of 2026. While some residents express fear and take precautions, animal welfare activists argue that strays can be affectionate if treated properly. India's top court has issued revised orders for sterilization and release in the same localities.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark lending rate, yet long-term interest rates, including those for mortgages, paradoxically increased. This phenomenon occurred as bond traders "sold the news" after recent gains, viewing the Fed's easing policy as a risk to longer-duration securities, especially with inflation still above target. Experts suggest the bond market is signaling concern that the central bank might be overlooking persistent inflation by cutting rates too aggressively. A rise in long-term yields can impact borrowing costs for homes, autos, and credit cards, with homebuilder Lennar already reporting "elevated" interest rates as a pressure.

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi for perceived inaction on investigations into political opponents, specifically naming James Comey, Adam Schiff, and Letitia James, urging "JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!" He later praised Bondi in a follow-up post. Separately, the White House announced a pending deal for TikTok's US operations, which would give Americans control over the app's algorithm and six of seven board seats. Oracle, chaired by Trump ally Larry Ellison, is set to lead data and privacy, with the deal expected to be signed soon, though China has yet to confirm.</p>

The film, set in Mumbai, explores an intimate relationship between two migrant women navigating same-sex desire and survival.

          <p>Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as business contractors, six weeks before the 2024 election. The MSNBC report claims Homan allegedly promised to secure government contracts in Trump's second term. Despite federal officials believing they had a strong bribery case, the investigation, initiated under the Biden administration, was closed by Trump's Justice Department, which called it a "deep state" probe. Critics, including Senator Adam Schiff, have condemned the closure as a corrupt attempt to conceal brazen graft.</p>

          <p>Ava Pickett's contemporary adaptation of Jane Austen's "Emma" reimagines the classic novel in a 21st-century Essex setting, with the protagonist navigating online dating and modern social dynamics after failing university. The play, staged at London's Rose Theatre, maintains Emma Woodhouse's meddling yet well-intentioned nature, now applied to friends' dating profiles rather than society balls. Pickett, drawing from her own experiences, highlights the "toxic" aspects of dating apps and the complexities of modern friendships. This fresh take on Austen's work explores universal themes of love, jealousy, and self-worth, making it relevant to contemporary audiences.</p>

          <p>UK students are increasingly struggling to cover living costs as maintenance loans fall significantly short of expenses, forcing many to juggle extensive paid work alongside their studies or endure long commutes. Research indicates maximum loans cover only half of freshers' costs, leading students like Tianna Hunkins to work 30-hour weeks and wear uniforms to lectures. This financial strain impacts academic focus and social opportunities. Universities are exploring support measures, while calls are growing for the Department for Education to reintroduce maintenance grants and increase loan amounts to address the widespread hardship.</p>

The action, intended to address "politicization or weaponization of intelligence," has deepened animosity between Gabbard and the CIA.
