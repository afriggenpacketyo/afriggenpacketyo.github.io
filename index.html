        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant number of homesellers are opting to pull their properties off the market rather than lower their asking prices, a trend signaling widespread frustration within the housing sector. According to a recent Realtor.com report, delistings have increased by 38% since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago, contributing to a potential market deadlock. Many sellers, benefiting from favorable mortgage rates, are unwilling to accept reduced offers despite a growing supply of homes for sale. This reluctance, coupled with persistent high prices and mortgage rates, continues to deter potential buyers, leading to stagnant sales and a notable disconnect between seller expectations and current market conditions.

          <p>Jermaine Mathews, identified by prosecutors as the instigator of a viral downtown Cincinnati beatdown, now faces new legal challenges with a federal indictment on drug conspiracy charges. The 39-year-old is accused of conspiring to distribute 40 grams or more of fentanyl and operating a premises for narcotics trafficking, according to the United States Attorney's Office. Mathews was previously on bond for aggravated riot and assault charges stemming from the July 26 incident outside a nightclub. This development underscores the escalating legal troubles for those involved, as federal authorities pursue charges unrelated to the initial assault, with another suspect also facing federal firearm charges.</p>

          <p>Australian Open champion Madison Keys experienced a shocking first-round exit at the US Open, attributing her defeat to uncharacteristic nerves. The sixth seed lost to world number 82 Renata Zarazua in an error-plagued match, making 89 unforced errors and 14 double faults. Keys, who won her first Grand Slam title earlier this year, described feeling "paralysing" nerves for the first time in a while, struggling to separate her strong desire to win from the immense pressure. This unexpected loss continues a trend of early exits for the American following her French Open quarter-final and Wimbledon third-round appearances.</p>

          <p>Despite rapid advancements in drone and robot technology, and calls from prominent figures like Elon Musk to prioritize autonomous weapons, major military powers such as China and the United States continue significant investments in costly crewed military systems, including sixth-generation fighter jets. Analysts suggest that while autonomous weapons offer clear advantages in reducing human casualties and operational costs, human decision-making and direct involvement remain central to complex combat scenarios. This ongoing investment reflects a strategic understanding that drones will redefine military roles and operations rather than completely replace human-crewed systems, indicating a persistent need for both in modern warfare.</p>

          <p>A late-arriving monsoonal storm system unleashed a variety of wild weather across the Western U.S. this weekend, fueled by lingering heat and atmospheric moisture. The storms caused a major dust storm at Nevada's Burning Man festival, leading to traffic halts and injuries, while bringing rare August rains to Yosemite National Park and minor flooding in Kern County. Additionally, thousands of lightning strikes sparked several forest fires, including the rapidly growing Garnet fire in the Sierra National Forest. Forecasters warn that the humid, monsoonal pattern and elevated temperatures will persist for a few more days, maintaining the threat of dry lightning, erratic winds, and flooding.</p>

          <p>Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the long-reigning leader of the Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn courtroom to a host of charges, including money laundering and drug trafficking, facing a mandatory life sentence. Zambada, 75, admitted to creating the cartel and promoting widespread corruption in Mexico by bribing police, military, and politicians for decades. Despite his lawyer denying cooperation, Zambada's family history of cooperation and the nature of his plea fuel speculation that he could reveal high-level corruption secrets. Former U.S. law enforcement officials suggest his knowledge spans 40 years of Mexican government and military co-option, making him a potentially invaluable source. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that former President Donald Trump's actions in a potential second term represent a significant expansion of federal power, moving towards what it terms "right-wing socialism." This includes bullying state governments, influencing private institutions like media and universities, and, notably, the federal government taking a 10% stake in Intel. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional Republican calls for limited government, with critics from both sides questioning the ideological shift. The article highlights unprecedented federal incursions into both public and private sectors, even as the government's headcount may shrink, resulting in a less effective but more intrusive state.</p>

Ngumoha, who will turn 17 this week, was introduced late in the game by manager Arne Slot and expertly finished a low cross from Mohamed Salah.

As Trump was discussing his administration's acquisition of a stake in Intel, he paused to ask, "Who is that back there? Alright, get out of the room." The incident, which caused some laughter among those present, was reportedly aimed at White House staff secretary Will Scharf, though footage did not definitively confirm his identity. This public display of the President's intolerance for distractions occurred while observers also noted a bruise on his hand, which the White House had previously explained as minor irritation from frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

Although two stabbings were recorded, neither resulted in serious injuries, marking a notable improvement from the previous year's fatalities. However, the use of LFR remains a contentious issue, with civil liberty and anti-racism groups criticizing it as a mass surveillance tool that could be less accurate for certain demographics, despite police defending its efficacy.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back EV incentives and promote fossil fuels, Ford is making a significant $5 billion investment in a new electric vehicle platform for a $30,000 four-door pickup truck, set for 2027 delivery. This move challenges the notion that the US EV market is stalling, signaling automakers' long-term commitment to electrification. While Trump has worked to undo policies like the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits, global markets continue to shift towards EVs, with major players like China leading the way. Ford's strategy focuses on affordability and global competitiveness, suggesting that economic viability, rather than political headwinds, will ultimately drive the EV transition.

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that the Department of Justice intends to sue California over Governor Gavin Newsom's efforts to implement a new, Democratic-leaning congressional redistricting map. This announcement, made during a press event, follows Trump's recent praise for Texas Republican legislators who successfully codified a new map expected to give the GOP an advantage in five more U.S. House races. Governor Newsom swiftly challenged Trump's threat with a defiant "BRING IT." The situation underscores the intensifying political and legal battles over electoral maps, with Trump's administration seemingly applying different standards to similar redistricting efforts based on partisan outcomes, raising questions about federal intervention in state electoral processes.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders threatening to cut federal aid to cities and counties implementing cashless bail policies, arguing such practices contribute to rising crime. His first order specifically targeted Washington D.C., where federal troops have been deployed, while the second directed the Justice Department to identify other jurisdictions with similar policies for potential funding cuts. Trump claimed cashless bail leads to criminals escaping justice, though studies have not shown a correlation with increased crime. Critics view these actions as attempts to pressure Democratic-led areas and an overreach of federal power, particularly as the Supreme Court has upheld flag burning as free speech, which Trump also targeted.</p>

Figures from across the political spectrum condemned her post for potentially endangering an innocent person and contributing to panic.
