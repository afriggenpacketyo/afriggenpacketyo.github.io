          <p>The Trump administration has postponed the implementation of widespread higher tariffs but has issued new tariff threats to 14 countries, setting an August 1 deadline. Japan and South Korea face a potential 25% tax on their exports to the U.S., while other nations, primarily in Asia, were notified of rates ranging from 25% to 40%. While President Trump described the new deadline as "firm," he also indicated openness to further negotiations, a move some analysts interpret as a strategic tactic rather than a final decision. The policy aims to protect American industries but has raised concerns about increased consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been released from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility, over three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home. He and his wife, Yvette, were attacked in what authorities have described as part of a series of "politically motivated" assaults on lawmakers. The same suspect is accused of fatally shooting state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband on the same night. The alleged perpetrator has been arrested and faces multiple federal and state charges, including murder and attempted murder.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring all passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the change is being rolled out at major airports across the country, with the goal of expanding it nationwide. This move aims to expedite the security screening process for travelers. Passengers who are in the TSA PreCheck program were already exempt from this rule, and those who trigger alarms at security scanners will still be required to remove their footwear for additional checks.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial has demonstrated that a single gene therapy injection can significantly reverse hearing loss in both children and adults with a specific genetic form of deafness. The therapy involves delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All ten participants in the small-scale study showed considerable hearing improvement within a month, with one seven-year-old girl regaining almost full hearing. Researchers are hopeful this safe and well-tolerated method can be adapted for other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

Singapore offers a familiar cultural environment, with abundant Chinese cuisine and a perception of high economic and diplomatic openness.

          <p>A new report reveals that one in five vehicle accidents in the United States occurs in parking lots, which are cited as significant sources of danger due to driver distraction and poor urban design. In some American cities like San Bernardino, California, parking lots constitute nearly half of the downtown land area, creating vast, under-regulated spaces. The study connects high accident rates to common driver behaviors like using phones and to design flaws such as inadequate lighting and unclear markings. The analysis calls for improved safety measures from both city planners and drivers to mitigate these risks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has advanced a measure to permanently prevent landlords from evicting tenants under the pretext of a substantial remodel, a practice known as "renoviction." The amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance would only permit such evictions if a government agency issues an order to vacate the property to address housing code violations. This follows a temporary ordinance enacted earlier this year to curb the practice. The city is also developing rules to ensure landlords provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for tenants during legitimate, required renovations.</p>

The judge's order ensures Medicaid funding continues for 14 days, with a hearing scheduled.

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has activated another flight path, known as W121, near the median line of the Taiwan Strait, a move made without consulting Taipei. This is the last of three branches off the main M503 route, which at its closest point is only 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial dividing line. Beijing stated the route was activated to alleviate air traffic and improve safety. However, the unilateral decision has raised concerns in Taiwan, which views such actions as a potential challenge to its airspace and a source of regional tension.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no credible evidence of a so-called "client list" exists. The investigation also found no proof that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his sex trafficking operation. Officials stated that a systematic review of all files related to Epstein's crimes and death confirmed he harmed over 1,000 victims but did not uncover evidence to predicate investigations against uncharged third parties. The findings aim to dispel long-running conspiracy theories surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th career All-Star Game, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by Commissioner Rob Manfred. The selection, which recognizes his distinguished career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that his performance this year might not typically warrant a selection. This special designation has previously been used for other future Hall of Famers like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has aborted a planned $2.2 billion purchase of 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly driven by the demonstrated vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones, as seen in the war in Ukraine, as well as a significant increase in the aircraft's cost. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the country must invest in capabilities that reflect the future of warfare, such as drones and smart systems, rather than expensive legacy platforms. The canceled funds are expected to be redirected to programs focused on developing these newer military technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against those who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event being officially prohibited by the government. The decision alleviates fears that participants could face fines and organizers, including Budapest's mayor, could face prison time. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, as the mayor had declared it an official municipal event, which would exempt it from the ban. The march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and community members have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital condemn inflammatory remarks made by one of its partners, Shaun Maguire. Maguire posted on social media that Zohran Mamdani, the Muslim Democratic mayoral candidate for New York City, "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and is advancing an "Islamist agenda." The letter calls for Sequoia to apologize, conduct an independent investigation into Maguire's behavior, and implement a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech.

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons has warned that an overwhelming flow of illegal drugs is destabilizing prisons across England and Wales and undermining rehabilitation efforts. Criminal gangs are using drones and other methods to smuggle contraband to inmates, who often turn to drugs out of boredom in overcrowded and understaffed facilities. The report found that in many jails, criminality is rampant and that inexperienced staff are unable to contain it. The watchdog called the failure to control the drug trade a threat that needs to be addressed at the highest levels of government.</p>

In his court filing, Phypers listed their date of separation as July 4 and is seeking spousal support from Richards. He claims to have no income since closing a business last year, while estimating Richards earns over $250,000 per month from her various ventures. The couple married in September 2018, shortly after Phypers finalized his divorce from actor Nicollette Sheridan. Richards has not yet publicly commented on the divorce filing.</p>
