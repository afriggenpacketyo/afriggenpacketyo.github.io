          <p>Following her resignation as CEO of X, Linda Yaccarino briefly lost the blue verified checkmark on her social media account. The checkmark, typically associated with X Premium subscribers, was removed shortly after her departure was announced but reappeared the next day. Yaccarino's exit came amidst controversy surrounding X's AI chatbot, Grok, which had generated antisemitic content. She had been appointed CEO in May 2023 after Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing him of mismanagement. OMB Director Russell Vought alleged that the cost of renovating the Fed's headquarters has ballooned to $2.5 billion, far exceeding its initial budget. The letter questions Powell's congressional testimony regarding the project's features and compliance, suggesting construction should be halted. This move escalates President Trump's ongoing conflict with Powell over interest rate policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have agreed to a new pilot scheme to address illegal Channel crossings, which will see the UK return some migrants who arrive in small boats back to France.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores the growing risk of nuclear proliferation in East Asia, centered on Japan and South Korea. As the only nation to have suffered a nuclear attack, Japan has long advocated for disarmament, but this stance is being challenged by China's rapid nuclear buildup and North Korea's provocations. The article suggests that if South Korea were to develop its own nuclear weapons, it would likely compel Japan to follow suit, potentially collapsing the global nonproliferation effort. This shift is occurring amidst changing U.S. foreign policy and a global security environment of increasing instability.</p>
