          <p>A trade agreement reducing tariffs between the United States and the United Kingdom has officially commenced, notably benefiting British car and aerospace exporters. The deal allows UK automakers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles to the US at a lower tariff rate. However, the agreement does not resolve the contentious 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum, which could double if a separate deal is not reached by a looming July 9 deadline, creating significant uncertainty for the industry.

The analysis suggests that as these cities grow more affluent, they adopt the same restrictive zoning and NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) attitudes that limited supply on the coasts, creating a national housing shortage.

          <p>Chinese chip firm Sophgo announced that its SC11 FP300 compute card has been successfully verified to run the large language model from AI firm DeepSeek. This verification, conducted by a state-affiliated lab, marks a key milestone in China's push for technological self-reliance, demonstrating that domestically developed hardware can effectively support leading domestic AI systems. The achievement is attributed to innovations in Sophgo's compute card, which features high-bandwidth memory to accelerate AI model execution.</p>
