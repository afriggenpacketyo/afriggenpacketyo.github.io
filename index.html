          <p>London's public transport system is set for significant disruption as Underground staff, represented by the RMT union, have commenced a five-day strike. The industrial action centers on disputes over pay and working conditions, with the union demanding a 32-hour work week. Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay rise but deems the reduced hours unaffordable, leading to the first network-wide shutdown since March 2023. Services are expected to be severely limited until Friday morning, impacting millions of commuters across the capital.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected animal rights extremist on the FBI's most wanted list, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being discovered in Wales. He had been a fugitive for 21 years, wanted in connection with two bombings in California in 2003. Former FBI agents recall "missed opportunities" to arrest him before he vanished, later finding a suspected bomb-making lab in his abandoned car. San Diego, who had a $250,000 bounty, now faces being sent back to the U.S. to stand trial for his alleged crimes.</p>

Significant yield movements in U.K. gilts and French government bonds have dominated financial news, with political uncertainty in France adding to investor concerns. The ECB is expected to hold interest rates steady, but President Christine Lagarde will likely face questions about market stability. Analysts are also watching for a Fitch rating review of France's sovereign debt as a potential inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is accelerating the development of a new class of low-cost, long-range attack drones to enhance its strategic strike capabilities against mainland China. In collaboration with U.S. firm Kratos, Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology is creating the Chien Feng IV, a suicide drone reportedly capable of reaching targets over 1,000km away. This "high-low" strategy aims to provide an affordable alternative to expensive cruise missiles, allowing Taiwan to potentially strike deep within Chinese territory. The new system is set to be unveiled at an upcoming defense exhibition.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur, offering a celestial spectacle for observers across the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. The event will cause the full Moon to pass through Earth's shadow, giving it a distinct reddish hue commonly known as a "Blood Moon." Visibility in the UK will vary by location, with eastern regions getting the best and longest view as the Moon rises. Astronomers explain the phenomenon is caused by the refraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere, a process similar to what creates red sunsets.</p>

The author argues that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's current approach of accommodating Trump has yielded few benefits for the UK while incurring significant reputational costs. The piece suggests that resistance and firmness are more effective tactics when dealing with Trump's transactional style of diplomacy and frames his upcoming state visit as a potential embarrassment.</p>

The team fell into a 23-0 deficit before rallying, but a late interception thrown by quarterback Nico Iamaleava sealed the loss. The 0-2 start, the team's worst since 2019, increases pressure on coach DeShaun Foster to address the team's persistent problems.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from the U.S. and China has developed a novel method for launching tiny robots using the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat a surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then violently collapse. This collapse creates a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects nearly five feet into the air. By controlling the laser, scientists can direct the launch or even make the objects "swim," opening new possibilities for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military is expanding its operations in Gaza City and has instructed Palestinian residents to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the south called Muwasi. This order comes as Israel prepares for a potential seizure of the famine-stricken city, which it describes as a Hamas stronghold. Aid organizations have warned that such a large-scale evacuation could worsen the already severe humanitarian crisis, as many residents have been displaced multiple times and are too weak to move. The designated safe zone is located in an area that has previously been struck by Israeli forces.</p>

          <p>Heather Hall, a college instructor and mother of two from South Carolina, has been identified as the American citizen killed in the recent funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal. Hall, who taught literacy and special education at the College of Charleston, was in Lisbon to speak at a conference when the tragic accident occurred, killing 15 other people. Her family and colleagues remembered her as a passionate advocate for people with disabilities and someone who lived life to the fullest. Investigators believe a snapped cable caused the funicular to derail.</p>
