          <p>Donald Trump is concluding his four-day visit to Scotland with a meeting with First Minister John Swinney to discuss key trade issues, including the 10% US tariff on Scotch whisky. The visit, which has been a mix of political and business engagements, also saw Trump meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his Turnberry resort. During his trip, Trump has reiterated his criticism of wind turbines while promoting North Sea oil and gas. The visit culminates with the opening of a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort before he returns to the UK for a state visit in September.</p>

          <p>Amid the current popularity of collectible toys like Labubu, this article explores the history of the Monchhichi doll, a Japanese creation that became a global sensation in the 1980s. While the toy was a massive success in Western Europe and the US, it was unavailable in communist East Germany due to a ban on capitalist consumer goods. In response, a state-owned enterprise in the toy-making town of Sonneberg created a similar doll called the Tiemi. These East German versions became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc and are now sought-after collector's items.</p>

          <h2>Barclays Exceeds Second-Quarter Profit Forecasts, Announces Share Buyback</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its investment banking division. The bank also announced a new £1 billion share buyback program. The positive results were largely due to increased market volatility, which boosted trading income and helped offset a decline in advisory fees. This performance aligns with trends seen at other major banks like Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase, which also benefited from recent market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets to strengthen their striking options, should they decide to make further acquisitions this transfer window. The club acknowledges the need to sell some current players first to fund any new signings, which may delay potential moves until closer to the deadline. Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reluctant to sell Watkins and Newcastle is also reportedly interested in Sesko. United considers the suggested £60 million price for Watkins to be excessive for the 29-year-old.</p>

          <p>Experts in China are urging Beijing to adopt a more proactive approach in shaping its international image and to engage more with other Asian nations to counter Western-dominated narratives. They argue that as global power dynamics shift, China must leverage its cultural symbols and lead in defining Asian discourse, rooted in principles of "harmony and diversity." This strategy involves taking a leading role in setting international norms in emerging fields to better align the country's soft power with its economic growth. The call comes as the influence of the Global South and blocs like Brics continues to rise in global governance.</p>

          <p>Qatar's bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympics is seen as a logical next step in its history of hosting major sporting events, but it faces significant hurdles. An Olympic scholar notes that key criteria for the IOC are political and popular support, which could be complex to gauge in Qatar. The primary challenge is the extreme summer heat, which would likely necessitate moving the games to November, disrupting the global sports calendar. Other potential issues include human rights concerns, regional competition with Saudi Arabia, and the overall image of the nation, making it a potentially risky choice for the IOC.</p>

          <p>For the first time, India has overtaken China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., according to new market research. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, with total volume jumping 240%. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies. In contrast, China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. fell to 25%, highlighting a significant realignment in global technology supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

The steepest annual increases were seen in commuter towns and northern regions, driven by high demand and limited supply. While the pace of yearly rent increases is beginning to slow, the number of available rental properties remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Singapore Airlines' Shares Decline Sharply After Reporting 59% Drop in Quarterly Profit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines fell by over 8% after the carrier announced a 59% plunge in net profit for the first quarter. The company attributed the significant decline to lower interest income and, notably, losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex restructuring. While demand for air travel remains strong, the airline's operating profit also fell due to increased competition and normalizing margins from post-pandemic highs. Analysts note that Air India's financial performance is likely to remain a drag on Singapore Airlines' earnings in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery. The conviction stems from a case in which he was accused of attempting to influence the testimony of imprisoned former paramilitary members who had linked him to their groups. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, is a deeply polarizing figure credited by supporters for combating leftist insurgencies but accused by critics of human rights abuses. He faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal the verdict, which has intensified political divisions within the country.</p>

          <p>In his first official phone call with South Korea's new foreign minister, Cho Hyun, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi encouraged Seoul to adopt an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable China policy from South Korea to deepen pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The conversation comes as Beijing seeks to reset relations with the new South Korean administration under President Lee Jae-myung. The ministers also agreed to work towards making the upcoming APEC summit a turning point in bilateral ties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The new policy offers families 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a program expected to benefit around 20 million families. This move follows various local pilot programs and comes as official data shows China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024. The high cost of raising children is considered a major factor in the low birth rates, and this subsidy aims to help alleviate that financial burden.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to block a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This policy reverses the long-standing practice of granting bond to individuals who are not considered a flight risk or public safety threat. Immigrant rights advocates argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law, violates due process, and causes catastrophic harm by separating families. The lawsuit targets top administration officials and seeks an immediate halt to the practice.</p>

Taiwan's Presidential Office cited domestic issues, including typhoon recovery efforts, as the reason for the decision. The potential for a high-profile U.S. visit by a Taiwanese leader is a sensitive diplomatic issue that often draws strong opposition from China.</p>

Convoys of trucks and humanitarian airdrops are delivering food, but the United Nations warns the current volume is insufficient to prevent widespread starvation, with a need for at least 500 trucks daily. The UN's agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, reports that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and that desperation is leading people to loot aid convoys.
