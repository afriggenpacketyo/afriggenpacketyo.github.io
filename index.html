        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," hosted by Davina McCall, which blends elements of "Love Island," "Married at First Sight," and "Survivor." In the series, couples are matched by experts after a brief speed date, undergo a symbolic wedding, and are then left on a remote tropical island to build a relationship amidst survival challenges. Contestants, who are generally older than those on similar shows, suggest the format fosters authenticity by stripping away superficial elements like makeup and fashion. The show aims to test if love can blossom under adverse conditions, potentially creating stronger bonds than traditional dating show environments.</p>

          <p>Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive back Shilo Sanders has been fined $4,669 by the NFL for throwing a punch during a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills, an action that led to his ejection. The incident preceded his waiver by the Buccaneers, leaving his professional football career uncertain. Sanders, the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, had been praised by coach Todd Bowles for his aggressive play but was also admonished for the inexcusable on-field punch. In a social media video, Sanders stated he is exploring his next steps, which could include opportunities with another NFL team or pursuing interests outside of football, such as music or modeling.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the United Kingdom are employing a sophisticated array of methods, including drones, sniffer dogs, and adapted nuclear fallout models, to combat the destructive spruce bark beetle. This invasive species, which has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe, threatens the UK's £2.9 billion timber industry by being carried over the English Channel on the wind. The multi-faceted approach involves using drones for aerial surveillance, dogs to detect the beetles' pheromones in timber stacks, and real-time camera traps to monitor their spread. These efforts have successfully eradicated the beetle from controlled zones in southeast England, though rising climate change risks pose an ongoing threat.</p>

De Minaur was leading the match when Altmaier, who was visibly struggling after a grueling previous round, could not continue. De Minaur, the eighth seed, now has a favorable path to the quarterfinals, where he will face a qualifier ranked 435th in the world. Meanwhile, Australia's last remaining woman in the singles draw, Daria Kasatkina, was eliminated after a three-set loss to two-time champion Naomi Osaka, who will next face Coco Gauff.</p>

          <h2>Chicago Mayor Issues Executive Order to Counter Proposed Federal Immigration Enforcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 20:30:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order to prevent city departments, including the police, from cooperating with federal immigration raids anticipated by the Trump administration. The order explicitly bars Chicago police from assisting in civil immigration enforcement, participating in related patrols, or setting up checkpoints. This move comes in response to the White House's plan to deploy federal officers to Chicago and other sanctuary cities as part of a broader immigration crackdown. Johnson condemned the federal strategy as reckless and unconstitutional, asserting the city's authority to protect its residents' rights against what he termed a potential militarized deployment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed diminished confidence that a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will occur, despite his previous efforts to arrange one. In a recent interview, Trump suggested that a three-way meeting involving himself is more likely than a bilateral summit between the two leaders. This comes as Zelenskyy voiced frustration over Russia's perceived lack of constructive engagement in peace negotiations, accusing Moscow of delaying high-level talks. Meanwhile, the conflict continues to escalate, with Russia's military chief claiming a "nonstop" offensive along the front line and recent aerial attacks striking southern Ukraine and central Kyiv.</p>

          <p>A temporary immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is being shut down following a judge's order, but not before families of detainees have come forward with allegations of poor conditions and medical neglect. The facility, a symbol of the Trump administration's immigration policies, is now the subject of a lawsuit alleging inmates were denied proper access to legal counsel. One family claims their son was left bleeding in severe pain after surgery, while another woman reported losing contact with her husband for over a week after he was hospitalized for a kidney rupture. The Department of Homeland Security has denied the claims of medical neglect.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant service outage, with many reporting their phones were stuck in "SOS mode" for several hours. The company confirmed it was aware of a "software issue" impacting wireless service and stated that its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage, tracked by the website DownDetector, peaked with nearly 23,000 complaints from locations spanning from California to Florida. The SOS mode allows devices to make emergency calls by connecting to other available networks, but it leaves users without normal call, text, or data capabilities, causing widespread frustration among affected subscribers.</p>

          <p>A largely unregulated industry of for-profit "body brokers" in the United States is acquiring and dismembering donated corpses to sell for profit, often to medical research centers and training facilities. Unlike the strictly controlled organ donation system, this trade operates in a legal gray area, allowing companies to charge substantial "processing" fees for body parts. This article highlights cases where families, believing they were making an altruistic donation to science, discovered their loved ones' bodies were treated disrespectfully and dismembered with coarse tools. The lack of federal oversight has led to exploitation of grieving families and turned the U.S. into a global exporter of human cadavers.</p>

          <p>New data from England's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between missing school in the first week of term and chronic absenteeism throughout the academic year. According to the figures, 57% of students who were absent at all during the first week of the 2024 school year went on to become "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of their classes. In contrast, only 14% of students with perfect attendance in the first week later became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged parents and schools to prioritize attendance from day one to combat this trend, which has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Her departure is expected to set off a competitive race for the open seat, with Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to announce her candidacy. During her tenure, Ernst held several leadership positions and was known for her advocacy on military sexual assault prevention and her calls for federal budget cuts. Democrats are hopeful for an opportunity in the state, despite not winning a Senate race there since 2008.</p>

The comments come amid reports that the Pentagon is drafting plans for a significant deployment in the city as part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration and crime in Democratic-run cities. The White House has dismissed Pritzker's accusations, asserting that the focus is on addressing Chicago's violent crime rate.</p>

This model could serve as a corrective to an international system often paralyzed by competing national interests and vetoes within institutions like the United Nations.

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, presented as an ambitious, large-scale project funded by Netflix. The film, which stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, is a project del Toro has envisioned for decades, inspired by the 1818 novel and classic film adaptations. The movie is structured in three parts, exploring the story from the perspectives of both the creator and the creature, aiming to humanize the monster and delve into his origins. Early reviews are mixed, with some critics praising its epic scope and artistry, while others found it somewhat lacking in substance despite its visual mastery.</p>

However, councillors maintained that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, a sentiment echoed by some local residents who consider it background noise. The council recently invested £55,000 to restore the 150-year-old clock, and the hotel owner must now wait six months before submitting another proposal.</p>

          <p>A new investigation into the 1967 death of Pauline Pusser has implicated her husband, the famed Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, whose life inspired the movie "Walking Tall." Previously believed to be the victim of an ambush meant for her husband, new evidence from an exhumation and modern forensics suggests Pusser may have staged the crime scene. The findings indicate Pauline was shot outside their vehicle and that a wound Buford sustained was likely a close-contact, self-inflicted injury, contradicting his long-held account of the events. If he were alive today, investigators believe there would be sufficient probable cause to seek a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>Recent Premier League matches have reignited frustrations over the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), with several controversial decisions dominating post-game discussions. Burnley manager Scott Parker criticized the technology for making football "sterile" after his team lost to a late penalty awarded by VAR against Manchester United. In another match, Fulham manager Marco Silva was left seething after a goal was disallowed for a minor foul in the build-up. This article highlights a growing sentiment among managers, players, and pundits that the forensic scrutiny of VAR is detracting from the enjoyment of the game and leading to inconsistent or overly pedantic rulings.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebel movement has confirmed that its self-proclaimed Prime Minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the capital, Sanaa. The strike, which occurred earlier in the week, also killed several other senior officials, including the group's foreign minister and ministers of justice and youth. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the strike targeted a gathering of senior Houthi leaders and was executed within hours of receiving intelligence. This attack represents a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, where Houthis have been launching missiles at Israel and targeting ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has solved the mystery of a large gash found in the newly installed limestone in the White House Rose Garden. In a social media post, Trump stated that after demanding an immediate investigation, White House security footage identified the culprits as subcontractors using a broken steel cart that scraped against the stone. Trump, emphasizing his background as a builder, declared the stone will be replaced at the contractor's expense and that the company will be barred from future work at the White House. The Rose Garden renovation, which replaced grass with a stone surface, was a project initiated by the president.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 victory against Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the narrow win against the newly promoted side highlighted persistent issues, particularly with goalkeeping. Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made a critical error that led to Burnley's second goal, continuing a pattern of costly mistakes from United's keepers this season. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers and the team as a whole, noting that every mistake is magnified at the club. The win does little to mask the urgent need for stability as United faces a difficult stretch of upcoming matches.</p>

The 23-year-old shooter, who had legally purchased three firearms, was a former student at the attached school and had reportedly conducted surveillance on the church weeks prior. Investigators are examining a video manifesto the shooter scheduled to post online, which contained hateful writings against various groups, and are treating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most countries are illegal, stating that he overstepped his executive authority. The court found that the power to impose such broad levies rests exclusively with Congress. The decision places tariffs affecting approximately 69% of U.S. goods imports on shaky legal ground, though the duties will remain in effect until October 14 to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the ruling does not affect sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum or those imposed on China during Trump's first term, which were justified under different legal authorities.</p>

          <p>This article provides expert consensus on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that guidelines should align with developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three, as they need to explore their physical environment and develop self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes is suggested to allow time for imaginative play and social interaction. As children get older, recommended limits increase, but the focus shifts to content quality and parental supervision. Experts stress the importance of open communication and setting clear household rules, including for parents, to foster healthy media habits and avoid addiction.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook pose a significant threat to the central bank's political independence. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy and lead to severe long-term economic consequences, including weaker markets, higher inflation, and a depreciated currency. She suggests that while markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, the sustained impact of higher inflation would ultimately harm consumption and corporate earnings. This move is seen as a first step toward stacking the Fed with loyalists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is laying off more than 500 employees of the federally funded Voice of America (VOA), a move that proceeds despite a recent court ruling intended to protect the agency's operations. Kari Lake, acting CEO of VOA's parent agency, announced the elimination of 532 government positions, which will drastically reduce the global news organization's staff and broadcasting capabilities. This action follows a federal judge's order blocking the administration from firing VOA's director and threatening contempt for noncompliance with a previous ruling to restore the network. The layoffs are seen by critics as a continued attack on the agency, which provides news in regions with restricted press freedom.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health through his long-standing anti-vaccine crusade and promotion of conspiracy theories. In an op-ed, Sanders cited the recent firing of the CDC director and subsequent resignations of other top officials as evidence of Kennedy's destructive influence. He argued that Kennedy is launching a "war on science" that undermines the nation's health infrastructure and will make it harder for Americans to access life-saving immunizations. The call comes amid widespread criticism of Kennedy from the medical community and hundreds of public health employees.</p>
