          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa is reportedly planning not to run for a third term in 2026, a decision that would open up a competitive Senate race. First elected in 2014, Ernst is the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and has held several leadership positions within her party. Her departure is expected to prompt Representative Ashley Hinson to announce a bid for the seat, setting the stage for a significant political contest in a state that has trended Republican in recent federal elections but where Democrats have seen some recent local success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has strongly condemned reports of a potential Trump administration plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the idea an "invasion." Pritzker stated his office has not been contacted about the deployment and suggested the move has aims beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker for deflecting from the city's crime issues. This development follows similar federal deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., which have sparked legal and political challenges over federal authority and the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy amid a dysfunctional international system. As a leader of a major economic power that bridges competing ideologies, Prabowo can champion a model of "constructive pragmatism." The article argues that Indonesia's unique non-aligned stance allows it to foster cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a potential corrective for global institutions like the United Nations, which are often paralyzed by national agendas, offering a practical path forward for international relations.</p>

          <h2>Chicago Mayor Issues Executive Order to Counter Potential Federal Agent Deployment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 18:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to reports of a potential federal deployment, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The order seeks to prevent the deputization of local police, bar federal agents from wearing masks, and require them to display clear identification. Johnson emphasized that the city will use all available legal tools to counter what he views as an attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate citizens and violate their constitutional rights.

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant service outage, with many phones being limited to "SOS mode" for several hours. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service and confirmed its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage flooded social media and tracking sites like DownDetector, with complaints originating from coast to coast. The SOS mode allows devices to make emergency calls by connecting to other available networks, but leaves users without standard call, text, or data services, causing widespread disruption for customers.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, presenting an ambitious and large-scale take on Mary Shelley's classic novel. The Netflix-funded film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, exploring the story from both characters' perspectives. Del Toro, known for humanizing monstrous figures, aimed to portray the creature with beauty and as a newborn being. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its epic scope and artistry, while others find it lacks the emotional voltage to fully come to life.</p>

The protest, held under the banner "United4Gaza – Stop the Genocide Now!", proceeded largely without major incidents. However, police did detain one speaker for comments allegedly trivializing the Holocaust and the October 7th Hamas attacks, and noted a few other minor criminal offenses.</p>

Pusser, whose story inspired the movie "Walking Tall," had long claimed his wife was killed in an ambush meant for him, but modern forensic analysis of the exhumed body and crime scene evidence revealed major inconsistencies. Investigators now believe the scene was staged and that a gunshot wound to Pusser's own cheek was likely self-inflicted. Officials stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough evidence for a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on numerous countries are illegal, stating he overstepped his presidential authority. The decision, which the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, puts a significant portion of his trade agenda in jeopardy, though sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum remain unaffected. The court found that the power to impose such broad tariffs resides with Congress, not the executive branch under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling creates uncertainty for global trade and U.S. economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Patterson notes that politicizing a central bank historically leads to weaker stock markets, higher inflation, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she argues the long-term consequences would be damaging, potentially steepening the yield curve, weakening the dollar, and hurting consumer spending through sustained inflation.

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded Jack Grealish's performance, calling him "better than I thought" after the player inspired another victory for the club. Since joining on a season-long loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been instrumental, registering two assists in consecutive Premier League games. The article highlights his resurgence from a forgotten player on the City bench to Everton's main creative force. Despite his excellent club form, Grealish was recently left out of the England squad, raising questions about his chances of making the World Cup team next year.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health. In an op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine crusade and advocacy for conspiracy theories, which he argues are now being implemented as dangerous policy. The call for resignation comes amid turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where the director was fired and several top officials resigned in protest. Sanders warned that Kennedy's actions are undermining science and could lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with cutting over 500 jobs at the Voice of America (VOA) and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The announcement from acting CEO Kari Lake came just a day after a federal judge blocked her from firing VOA's director and ordered her to comply with previous rulings to restore the news outlet's operations. Lake stated the layoffs are being conducted at the president's direction to reduce bureaucracy. This move escalates a legal and political battle over the fate of the government-funded broadcaster, which provides news to countries with limited press freedom.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK have vowed to continue their legal challenges against the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against them. The court overturned an injunction that had prevented asylum seekers from being housed at a hotel in Epping, a decision seen as a precedent. However, councils, including those controlled by Reform UK, argue that using hotels for this purpose constitutes an unauthorized change of use under planning laws and raises safety concerns. The government maintains that while hotels are not a sustainable solution, their use is necessary for now.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media. He was photographed on a family golf outing in Washington, D.C., appearing to be in good health. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in if a tragedy occurred, which raised concerns about Trump's well-being. The White House has previously addressed health concerns, attributing visible bruising on his hands to frequent handshaking and noting a benign diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency.</p>
