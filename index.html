          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 15:22:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veteran UK Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended by the Labour Party following an investigation into her recent comments on racism. In a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated her controversial view that prejudice against Jewish, Irish, and Traveller people is different from racism based on skin color, as it is not always visible. This stance, which she first articulated in a 2023 newspaper letter that led to a previous suspension, has drawn fresh criticism from party leadership. The suspension means Abbott, the longest-serving female MP, will now sit as an independent while the party investigates her remarks, which have reignited internal debates on antisemitism and racism.</p>

          <p>Greek authorities have arrested five individuals in connection with the murder of Przemyslaw Jeziorski, a 43-year-old UC Berkeley marketing professor. The suspects include his ex-wife, her boyfriend, and three alleged accomplices, with the boyfriend reportedly confessing to the shooting. Jeziorski was killed in Athens on July 4 while in Greece for a court hearing related to an ongoing custody and property dispute over his 10-year-old twins. According to his family, he was shot five times by a masked gunman in what appears to have been a planned attack. The family expressed heartbreak but gratitude for the arrests, seeking full justice for the crime.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he noted mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that a comprehensive medical evaluation, including vascular studies, confirmed the benign and common condition, which affects blood flow in the veins. The evaluation ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis, and an echocardiogram showed normal heart function. Leavitt also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use for cardiovascular prevention, asserting that the president remains in excellent overall health and feels no discomfort from the condition.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged three more alleged MS-13 gang members in Maryland with racketeering conspiracy, which includes murder and drug trafficking. The charges against Salvadoran nationals Maxwell Ariel Quijano-Casco, Daniel Isaias Villanueva-Bautista, and Josue Mauricio Lainez stem from the July 4, 2024, killing of a homeless man in Hyattsville. The Department of Justice described the act as a brutal retaliatory murder intended to further the gang's influence and terror in local communities. This development occurs as another suspected MS-13 member, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, is on trial for separate human smuggling charges, highlighting ongoing federal efforts to dismantle the criminal organization's operations in the state.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli military strikes in Syria, ostensibly to protect the Druze minority during internal clashes, are being analyzed as part of a broader strategy to maintain regional dominance. Experts suggest Israel's objectives include preventing advanced weaponry from reaching the new Syrian government and carving out an informal buffer zone in southern Syria. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of exploiting internal unrest to derail peace efforts. Analysts note the timing of the strikes coincides with domestic political pressures on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who may be using the conflict to project strength amid his ongoing corruption trial and a fragile coalition government.</p>

The settlement includes $2 million in civil penalties and $1.6 million for consumer protection enforcement and investigation costs. As part of the deal, Peacock must make its auto-renewal terms clearer, obtain affirmative consent from customers, and provide an easy, immediate method for subscribers to cancel their service.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police Service is planning to close half of its station front counters, reducing the number from 37 to 19, due to significant budget pressures. This move breaks a previous commitment to maintain at least one 24/7 counter in each of the city's 32 boroughs. The Met stated that with a budget shortfall and shrinking force, keeping all counters open is no longer sustainable. While the force acknowledges that 5% of crimes are reported at these counters, it argues the closures will allow for the reallocation of resources to frontline policing. The decision comes as the Met struggles with funding and works to rebuild public trust.</p>

          <p>A social media trend known as "princess treatment," where women expect their partners to perform numerous services from opening doors to paying their bills, is generating widespread discussion. Popularized by influencers on platforms like TikTok, the concept frames high-maintenance demands as a baseline for a worthy relationship, sometimes in response to a perceived decline in traditional masculinity. Critics and relationship experts argue that while it may seem empowering, the trend often promotes regressive gender roles and a passive, self-focused approach to dating. This phenomenon highlights a cultural tension between traditional values and modern economic realities where women are increasingly financially independent.</p>

While it is possible to consolidate debt, retirees on fixed incomes may face difficulties qualifying for traditional loans with favorable terms due to debt-to-income ratio considerations. The article outlines several alternatives, including home equity loans, debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies, direct negotiation with creditors for hardship programs, and debt settlement. For those with overwhelming debt, bankruptcy is presented as a final option, noting that Social Security income is generally protected from creditors in such proceedings. (not investment advice)</p>

Her death comes just months after her 1962 song "Pretty Little Baby" went viral on TikTok, introducing her music to a new generation. Francis's career was marked by massive hits like "Stupid Cupid" and "Lipstick On Your Collar," but also by immense personal tragedy, including being a victim of a brutal sexual assault in 1974 and the murder of her brother in 1981. These events led to severe depression and a long battle with bipolar disorder, during which she became a prominent advocate for crime victims and mental health awareness.</p>

          <p>Police in Arcadia, California, have removed 21 children from a home after discovering a 2-month-old with significant head trauma, leading to an investigation into the parents and a nanny. The parents, Guojun Xuan and Silvia Zhang, were arrested on suspicion of felony child endangerment for allegedly failing to seek medical care for the injured infant for two days. The case has also uncovered a complex situation involving multiple surrogate mothers who claim they were deceived by the couple. These women, who carried some of the children, are now seeking answers after learning their babies were living among a large number of other children in a situation of alleged neglect.</p>

          <p>Amid renewed public interest due to the release of court documents, this article examines how the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein amassed his estimated $560 million fortune. Despite never graduating from college, Epstein leveraged a teaching position at a prestigious school to secure a job at investment bank Bear Stearns. He then built a career as a money manager for billionaires like Les Wexner and Leon Black, earning hundreds of millions in fees. His wealth was further supported by financial relationships with major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which have since paid massive settlements for their roles in enabling his activities.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinning drug, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount off the list price. This direct-to-consumer model, operating through their Eliquis 360 support program, allows the companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who typically receive substantial rebates. Analysts believe this move will not negatively impact the companies' net pricing and could generate goodwill with the Trump administration amid concerns over drug costs. Eliquis is one of Bristol Myers' top-selling drugs but is expected to face generic competition in the U.S. within a few years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report alleges that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's administration diverted millions of dollars from disaster preparedness funds to hastily construct a migrant detention facility dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." An analysis by Talking Points Memo found that some of the nearly $20 million in contracts for the project went to political donors and allies of the governor. Florida Democrats have expressed outrage, calling the move irresponsible, especially as the Atlantic hurricane season nears its peak. The controversy deepened with revelations that a 15-year-old boy was mistakenly held at the facility, which authorities had claimed would only house adults, fueling further criticism of the project's management.</p>

This move is seen as another attempt to undermine the central bank's independence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic policy.
