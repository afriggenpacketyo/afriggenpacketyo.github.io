          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for 40 years. The investigation will examine the events of the day and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought this for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the decision to finally uncover the truth behind one of Britain's most contentious industrial disputes.</p>

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis, the parent company of brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Peugeot, has announced it anticipates a significant net loss of 2.3 billion euros for the first half of 2025. The company cited pre-tax net charges and the initial impact of U.S. tariffs as primary reasons for the downturn. This preliminary forecast was released after the company had previously suspended its financial guidance in April. The full, detailed financial results for the period are scheduled to be released on July 29, providing a clearer picture of the challenges facing the automaker. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to persistent deflation and an uncertain economic outlook, Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Assets under management in these funds have surged from $10 billion to over $50 billion since early last year, with corporate bond ETFs showing the fastest growth. Investors are attracted to the lower costs, diversification, and potentially higher returns compared to direct bond investments. This trend reflects a broader shift towards low-risk, fixed-income assets as a hedge against economic instability and weak domestic consumption in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are being closed due to severe fire safety deficiencies, forcing residents to become homeless. An investigation revealed that up to £1 million of tenants' and taxpayers' money was spent on failed attempts to repair the buildings, known as Beech Rise and Willow Rise. Residents described "years of hell" with soaring service charges and plummeting property values under a series of management companies.

The attack encrypted all company data and locked internal systems, and KNP was unable to pay the multi-million-pound ransom demanded.

According to police, a car veered off the road at high speed, crashed through a hedge, and landed on a trampoline in a backyard where the child was playing. The vehicle then apparently bounced off the trampoline and became lodged in the attic of a nearby barn about three meters off the ground. The driver and three other children in the car sustained only light injuries, while a female passenger was also seriously hurt.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is used to house asylum seekers, resulted in six arrests after escalating into what police described as "mindless thuggery." More than 1,000 demonstrators gathered, with some throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault in the town. Police implemented special dispersal and face-covering removal orders to manage the disorder, warning that they would deal robustly with any further criminal behavior from protesters.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His gang is blamed for much of the escalating violence in Ecuador and is suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition represents a major step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime and was enabled by a recent referendum.</p>

          <p>A new class of popular weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s, may be a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Some patients in early studies and anecdotal reports have experienced significant improvements in PCOS symptoms, including weight loss, regulation of menstrual cycles, and reduced androgen levels. Experts believe the drugs work indirectly by improving insulin sensitivity, which is often disrupted in women with PCOS. While more extensive research is needed, this development offers new hope for managing a complex condition for which treatment options have been limited.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast is emerging between the energy policies of China and the United States under the Trump administration, particularly concerning green technology. As global demand for electricity rises, driven by technologies like AI, China is forging ahead with investments in renewable energy sources to secure a technological lead. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is actively canceling tax credits for wind and solar power, which it deems unreliable, and promoting fossil fuels. This divergence in strategy could have significant long-term implications for the global energy landscape and the ongoing tech rivalry between the two superpowers.</p>

It is unclear what authority Trump would have to intervene in the project, as Congress has already given the city control over the proposed stadium site.</p>

While Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin and overall investor appetite remains resilient, this pattern of selling into strength has historically preceded price pullbacks.
