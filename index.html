            <p>This article recounts the chilling details of the Aaron Friar murder case in Medford, Oregon, where his 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, and her 19-year-old boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, conspired to commit the crime. Sierra Friar, Ellie's younger sister, provides key testimony about hearing a fight and seeing MacFarlane outside the house. The investigation reveals a complex web of accusations, including claims of abuse and manipulation, ultimately leading to guilty pleas from MacFarlane and Ellie, with Russell Jones pleading no-contest to conspiracy.
