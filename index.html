          <p>Karen Read, accused of killing her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022, has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to prevent her retrial. Read's attorneys argue that retrying her on charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of a fatal accident would violate double jeopardy protections, claiming the jury in her first trial had unanimously decided to acquit her on those charges before a mistrial was declared due to a deadlock. She maintains her innocence, denying allegations that she hit O'Keefe with her vehicle and left him to die during a blizzard. The Supreme Court's decision could significantly impact the trajectory of the case.</p>

          <p>UBS analysts predict that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a $350 price hike for Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max in the U.S., potentially increasing its retail price by nearly 30%. Shares of Apple have already plummeted due to concerns that tariffs will force the company to raise prices as consumer buying power decreases. Other analysts suggest Apple may raise prices globally by 6% or face a 15% cut to earnings per share. The majority of Apple's manufacturing is in China, making it highly vulnerable to the trade war.

          <p>Bonds are regaining popularity as a lower-risk option amidst stock market declines and rising volatility linked to President Trump's tariffs. While passive bond ETFs have historically been favored, actively managed bond strategies are now attracting significant investor interest. Experts suggest that active bond managers can outperform indexed bond funds more consistently than active stock managers. This shift is driven by the dynamic nature of the bond market and the potential for skilled managers to navigate changing conditions effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) announced the end of its decades-long partnerships with the federal government for refugee and child services, citing the Trump administration's halt of refugee resettlement funding. This decision will reduce the services available to those in need. The bishops sued the Trump administration over the funding halt, but a federal judge ruled against them. The move comes amid broader criticisms of the bishops' immigration policies.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices fell sharply, adding to previous losses, due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. The decline was further exacerbated by OPEC+'s decision to increase production. While Trump touted the fall in oil prices, analysts worry that the tariffs could lead to higher business costs and reduced economic activity, ultimately hurting oil demand. JPMorgan raised its recession odds following the tariff rollout. (not investment advice)</p>
