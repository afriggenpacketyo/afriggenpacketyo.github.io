            <p>Attorneys for Karmelo Anthony, a 17-year-old charged with the murder of Austin Metcalf at a Frisco, Texas high school track meet, released a statement expressing condolences to the Metcalf family and urging the public to avoid rushing to judgment. The incident occurred during an altercation in the bleachers, with Anthony allegedly confessing to the stabbing and claiming self-defense. Anthony is currently held on a $1 million bond, and his lawyers plan to seek a reduced bond and a re-evaluation of the charges. A fundraiser has been launched to support Anthony's defense.</p>

            <p>The White House announced that a 104% tariff on imports from China will take effect Wednesday, following through on President Trump's threat issued earlier this week. This action comes after China stated it would impose a 34% import fee on American products, which was in response to the U.S. initially planning to levy a 34% tariff on all goods imported from China. The White House stated that these retaliatory tariffs on roughly 90 countries are designed to open negotiations and prioritize American workers.</p>

            <p>Many U.S. small businesses are expressing concerns about the potential financial strain caused by President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which impose new import duties on goods from numerous countries. These businesses fear they will be forced to either raise prices for consumers or absorb the costs, impacting their profitability. Some small business owners have already filed lawsuits, arguing that the President is overstepping his authority by imposing these duties, as this power is constitutionally reserved for Congress. The tariffs could significantly affect small businesses, which lack the financial flexibility of larger corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A tech analyst responded to President Trump's suggestion that Apple manufacture iPhones in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, calling it unrealistic due to high costs. Needham analyst Laura Martin argues that Apple's expenses would dramatically increase, and the process of relocating the supply chain would take years. This perspective aligns with other Wall Street analysts who predict a significant price increase for iPhones produced domestically. The debate arises as Apple faces potential tariff rates of 104% on its manufacturing operations in China and other countries.</p>

            <p>The UN Secretary-General has described Gaza as a "killing field" due to the ongoing Israeli blockade and resumption of conflict. The UN is urging world leaders to act urgently to ensure food and supplies reach Palestinians. Israel has blocked all goods from entering Gaza for more than a month. UN agencies are reporting critical shortages of food, medicine, and essential supplies. The UN insists that Israel, as the occupying power, has obligations under international law to ensure that food and medical supplies get to the population.</p>

            <p>Three Americans sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for their role in a failed coup last year have been returned to the United States. The announcement came after President Trump's senior Africa advisor, Massad Boulos, traveled to the Congolese capital Kinshasa last week to discuss a putative U.S.-DRC minerals deal. Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi commuted the sentences of the three U.S. citizens accused of taking part in the coup attempt before Boulos arrived.</p>

            <p>Financial advisors recommend tax-loss harvesting as a strategy to mitigate the impact of stock market volatility. This involves selling losing assets to offset capital gains and reduce overall tax liability. With the S&P 500 Index experiencing significant downturns, investors should consider this strategy to minimize their tax burden. By strategically selling losing assets, investors can potentially improve their financial position during uncertain market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

According to Whipple, the debate marked a turning point in the Biden reelection campaign, ultimately leading to his decision to drop out of the race.</p>
