            <p>Elon Musk suggested during a recent call with xAI investors that he is aiming to establish a "proper value" for the artificial intelligence startup, according to sources familiar with the matter. While Musk did not explicitly mention a funding round, the comments were interpreted as a prelude to a significant capital raise. The company also reportedly discussed a potential revenue run rate of $1 billion or more, further signaling its growth trajectory. This follows previous reports of xAI seeking up to $6 billion in funding at a $50 billion valuation to acquire Nvidia chips.</p>

            <p>Major tech companies are bracing for potential impacts from President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies as they enter first-quarter earnings season. Uncertainty surrounding tariffs is causing market volatility and concerns about revenue and earnings for companies reliant on imports, particularly from China and Mexico. Companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia face challenges related to increased costs, potential ad spending declines, and adjustments to manufacturing and supply chain strategies.

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny after reports surfaced of a second Signal chat where he allegedly discussed details of an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, this time including his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. President Trump defended Hegseth, dismissing the reports as a "waste of time" and expressing continued confidence in his performance. Hegseth dismissed the allegations as "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees and stated that he is working with the president to change the Defense Department.

            <p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case challenging the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which determines which preventive healthcare services insurers must cover without cost to patients under Obamacare. The case questions whether the task force's structure violates the Constitution, as plaintiffs argue that its members are "principal officers" who require presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. A lower court ruling sided with the plaintiffs, potentially threatening access to free preventive care for millions of Americans if upheld, as critics say life-saving tests and treatments would become subject to co-pays and deductibles.</p>

            <p>As President Trump implements new tariffs, companies are increasingly turning to foreign trade zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to defer or avoid paying duties on imported goods. These designated sites allow companies to store or manufacture goods without being subject to U.S. duties until they are transferred for consumption. The increased interest in FTZs reflects concerns about the potential long-term impact of the trade war and the strategic advantage they offer in managing import costs and cash flow. However, setting up an FTZ can be costly, requiring professional services and dedicated IT systems.</p>

            <p>The growing friendship industry aims to combat loneliness by connecting people, but its focus on quantity over quality may be misguided. Research suggests that loneliness is not simply a result of a lack of friends, but rather a lack of intimacy and meaningful connection. Building strong friendships requires consistency, positivity, and vulnerability, elements that are often missing in superficial social events. Furthermore, the friendship industry fails to address the structural issues, such as economic inequality and mental health access, that contribute to loneliness, especially among young adults.</p>

            <p>Iowa is considering a constitutional amendment to address how traumatized witnesses, particularly children and vulnerable individuals, testify in court, balancing the right to confront accusers with the need to protect victims. The proposal stems from a state Supreme Court decision requiring face-to-face encounters between defendants and witnesses, diverging from federal precedent. The amendment would allow the legislature to limit this right for certain witnesses, but some worry it could infringe on defendants' rights. The measure requires further legislative approval and a public vote to amend the constitution.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security maintains that Hermosillo's own statements led to his arrest, but the incident highlights concerns about wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens by immigration officials, a problem that has occurred across administrations.</p>

            <p>China has warned it will take countermeasures against any trade deals that harm its interests as the Trump administration negotiates agreements with other countries. The Chinese commerce ministry says it respects efforts to resolve trade disputes with the U.S. but will respond if deals are struck at China's expense. The warning comes amid reports that Trump aims to use tariff negotiations to isolate China, even as he expresses interest in a deal with Beijing. China maintains that seeking tariff exemptions by harming others will ultimately hurt everyone.</p>

            <p>President Trump has escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a "major loser" and demanding immediate interest rate cuts. Trump argued that there is virtually no inflation and that the economy could slow down without lower rates. The attacks come as Trump and his team reportedly explore the possibility of legally firing Powell before his term expires in 2026. Experts suggest that any attempt to remove Powell would likely trigger a significant sell-off in U.S. equity markets.</p>

While coaching can be stressful, especially when worrying about entire teams, the ultimate lesson is that the children's victories belong to them alone.
