          <p>Violent protests in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, have continued for a second night, resulting in injuries to seventeen police officers and five arrests. Protesters hurled petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, while also setting cars ablaze and smashing windows. The unrest initially erupted after a peaceful demonstration concerning an alleged sexual assault, with two teenage boys appearing in court, speaking through a Romanian interpreter, and denying the charges. A mother-of-two is now fleeing her home due to the damage caused by the violence, considering a move back to Bulgaria. The incident has sparked condemnation from political figures and calls for calm, with concerns rising about escalating tensions and potential for further harm. The level of violence has prompted concerns about underfunding of police resources, as well as a fear of escalating illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume has jumped 12.5% after adjusting for the Memorial Day holiday, reaching its highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Despite this increase, overall volume remains historically low, and interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances saw a marginal rise to 6.93%. Refinance applications surged 16% for the week, while purchase applications rose 10%, potentially driven by increased housing inventory and easing home prices. While economic uncertainty persists, homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on the loosening housing market, although it remains to be seen if inflation data will affect these numbers.

The recovery is primarily driven by a January 1 EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15%, incentivizing corporate sales through attractive leasing deals and new EV models.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite early controversies and criticisms labeling it as a symbol of societal decay, The Simpsons has always maintained a core of moral integrity. Early episodes showcased the family's underlying values, such as Marge's reconciliation with Homer and Homer's realization of the importance of faith. Even Bart, despite his irreverence, loves his parents and attends church with them. The show's ubiquity led to clashes with the Bush administration, but ultimately, The Simpsons' ability to reflect the everyday struggles and anxieties of middle-American families has made it an enduring cultural institution.</p>

          <p>Two years after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in Ukraine, the landscape is undergoing a natural transformation, with lush vegetation and wildlife returning to the area. The Dnipro River has formed vast floodplains, reminiscent of the pre-dam era, and the area now teems with diverse species. However, the future of this new ecosystem is uncertain, as Ukraine debates whether to rebuild the hydroelectric power plant, which engineers argue is vital for water supply and energy. Ecologists, on the other hand, advocate for preserving the newly formed landscape as a national park.</p>
