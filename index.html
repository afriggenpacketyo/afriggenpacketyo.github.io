          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in American faith in Donald Trump's leadership, even among some Republicans, across various key issues. A majority of respondents described Trump's second term as "scary," with low approval ratings on the economy and immigration policy. Only 24% of Americans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities, and his approval rating stands at 42%, with even lower support among independent voters. This comes as Trump approaches 100 days in office, amid market volatility and controversial deportations.</p>

This meeting, facilitated by the Vatican setting, could mark a turning point in US policy towards Ukraine, although Trump's mercurial nature leaves the long-term impact uncertain.

          <p>The FBI's arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has sparked political division, with Republicans calling for her removal and Democrats decrying the action as an overreach of executive power. Dugan is accused of helping a man evade immigration officers at her courthouse. Democrats view the arrest as a reflection of the Trump administration's disregard for judicial independence, while Republicans accuse Dugan of obstructing law enforcement. The arrest has intensified the debate over immigration policy and the role of the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett suggests that shifting U.S. iPhone assembly to India is unrealistic due to continued reliance on Chinese components and potential backlash against Apple in China. He questions how this move would lower costs related to tariffs, as the components would still be made in China. Moffett also notes that carriers are unwilling to absorb tariff costs, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced demand. He cut his Apple price target, citing concerns about valuation and the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump met at the Vatican ahead of Pope Francis's funeral. The White House described the 15-minute meeting in St Peter's Basilica as "very productive" and Zelensky later called it "very symbolic" with the "potential to become historic". Trump took aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioning his willingness to end the war after Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.</p>
