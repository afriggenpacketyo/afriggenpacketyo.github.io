        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "No Kings" demonstrations opposing the Trump administration are significantly supported by some of the largest labor unions in the United States, including the SEIU and the American Federation of Teachers. Union leaders state that their involvement stems from a belief that a voice in democracy is essential for the power and freedom of working people, drawing parallels between current political issues and historical labor struggles. The article highlights personal stories, like that of a 75-year-old union member and civil rights veteran, who connects the current political climate to past fights for justice and equality.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 200 organizations has planned more than 2,700 "No Kings" protests across all 50 U.S. states, with millions of participants expected. The demonstrations are framed as a response to what organizers describe as the Trump administration's increasing authoritarianism, use of federal forces in cities, and attacks on democratic norms. Despite allies of the administration labeling the events as anti-American, organizers emphasize a commitment to nonviolent resistance and have trained thousands in de-escalation tactics to ensure peaceful assembly.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is having a direct and visible impact on Capitol Hill, as the U.S. Capitol Police force continues to protect lawmakers while not receiving paychecks. Officers, who face increasing threats in their line of work, missed their first full paycheck, creating financial strain for their families. The situation serves as a daily reminder to members of Congress of the real-world consequences of the political impasse, with union representatives calling on lawmakers to resolve the dispute and end the hardship for federal employees.</p>

          <p>Following the acquisition of Dominion Voting Systems, the new owner, Scott Leiendecker, is projecting different messages to the public and to his election official clients. Publicly, his new company, Liberty Vote, emphasizes a transformation to "restore faith in American elections," nodding to conservative priorities. However, in private communications with county officials, representatives have assured them it will be the "same team, same support, different name," raising questions about whether the change is a genuine overhaul or a strategic rebrand to appeal to a wider political base.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed that remains returned from Gaza are those of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old hostage who was killed during the October 7th attack on the Nir Oz kibbutz. His body is the tenth to be repatriated from Gaza, with his death having been announced by Israeli authorities in December 2023. The return of hostages, both living and deceased, is a central component of the ongoing ceasefire agreement, though Hamas has cited difficulties in locating all remains due to the destruction from Israeli strikes.</p>

          <p>Following a week of intense fighting at their shared border that resulted in dozens of civilian casualties, delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government are scheduled to meet for negotiations in Doha. The violence escalated after Pakistan accused Afghanistan of sheltering militants responsible for cross-border attacks, a claim the Taliban denies while making similar accusations against Pakistan. Despite a brief 48-hour truce, fresh fighting and Pakistani airstrikes have occurred, prompting Afghanistan to withdraw from a planned cricket series in Pakistan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former U.S. Representative George Santos, leading to his immediate release after serving less than three months. Santos had been convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited what he called horrible mistreatment of Santos in prison and praised his record of voting with Republicans, while some GOP members who pushed for Santos's expulsion criticized the move as unjust.

The test, which detects fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, successfully identified cancers in a North American study, with over half found at an early, more treatable stage. Notably, three-quarters of the cancers detected are types that currently have no routine screening programs, indicating the test could fundamentally change the approach to cancer detection if further trials, including one by the NHS, prove successful.</p>

          <p>Finnish President Alexander Stubb has stated his belief that U.S. President Donald Trump is the only world leader capable of forcing Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC, Stubb suggested that a combination of "carrot and stick" diplomacy is needed, and that Trump is the one who can effectively apply the necessary pressure. He expressed optimism that more progress toward peace has been made during Trump's second term than in the previous three years, while reaffirming that Finland would never recognize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territory.</p>

          <p>After his father's death, Antony Easton discovered a hidden suitcase that revealed his family's true identity as the Eisners, a wealthy Jewish family in pre-war Germany. The documents inside led him on a decade-long investigation, uncovering a multi-billion-dollar fortune in steel manufacturing, property, and art that was systematically stolen under Nazi rule. Through his research, Easton was able to trace and successfully file a restitution claim for a valuable painting, which a Berlin museum has agreed to return, helping to restore a piece of his family's lost history.</p>

          <p>Chinese automotive brands are rapidly gaining market share in South Africa, with sales volume growing by 86 percent in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year. Brands like Chery and Haval have significantly boosted their sales, capturing a combined 15 percent of the SUV market.

          <p>The damage from a historic storm that struck remote western Alaska is so severe that officials estimate many of the 2,000 displaced residents may not be able to return home for at least 18 months. The remnants of Typhoon Halong caused a massive storm surge, destroying up to 90% of the homes in some villages. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from the White House, as state and federal agencies work to provide shelter and long-term housing for evacuees who have been airlifted to Anchorage.</p>
