            <p>The State Department has reported that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man erroneously deported to El Salvador, is "alive and secure" in a Terrorism Confinement Center. This update comes after the Supreme Court ordered the U.S. government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. Despite the court order and President Trump's acknowledgment of the U.S.'s power to bring him back, the Justice Department has resisted, prompting Abrego Garcia's attorneys to request the government be held in contempt. Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation, with the government claiming he was a member of MS-13, a claim his lawyers and wife deny.</p>

            <p>Rumors are circulating about a possible meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for Russia's Victory Day celebrations. Such a meeting would signal a strong show of solidarity and defiance against U.S. pressure. However, it could also complicate China's relationship with North Korea, given Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions and increasing alignment with Moscow. The Kremlin has confirmed Xi's visit to Moscow for the event, and preparations for Kim's visit are reportedly underway.</p>

This move could be seen as an effort by Bangladesh to diversify its foreign policy and strengthen ties with Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. Previously, Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina had strengthened economic and strategic ties with India.</p>

The executive order seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. Susman Godfrey argues that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies.</p>

            <p>A group of former OpenAI employees are supporting Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company's move to become a for-profit entity. The ex-staffers filed a brief with the court expressing concerns that the transition would violate OpenAI's original mission and breach the trust of stakeholders. Musk's lawsuit alleges that OpenAI has abandoned its founding mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity. OpenAI, however, claims that its nonprofit mission will remain intact despite the restructuring.</p>

The attacks have forced thousands to flee the camps and el-Fasher. The war in Sudan has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with millions facing extreme hunger.</p>

            <p>President Trump's rapidly changing tariff policies have created economic uncertainty and led to panic buying among consumers. The implementation of tariffs on a wide range of imports has sparked concerns about rising prices and potential shortages. While some consumers are stocking up on goods, others feel paralyzed by the constant policy shifts. The tariffs have also disrupted businesses, with some introducing surcharges or canceling shipments from China. Economists predict that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Jordan Spieth suggested that the Masters organizers are censoring competitors from discussing the issue of mud balls, which can significantly affect shots due to mud attaching itself to the ball. Spieth expressed frustration that the topic is taboo, as it can impact scores, particularly on certain holes. He noted that the lower the ball is hit, the less chance of getting mud on it. Sergio García previously apologized to the Masters for criticizing the mud ball issue in 2009.</p>

            <p>Chef Andre Rush, former White House chef, described Donald Trump as the most difficult president to cook for due to his limited food preferences and aversion to trying new dishes. Trump's diet primarily consisted of burgers, fast food, and well-done steak, along with a significant consumption of Diet Coke. Rush noted that he had to "manipulate" Trump's food by subtly incorporating healthier options. He found Obama to be the easiest to cook for, as he had a more diverse palate.</p>

            <p>The UK government is taking control of Chinese-owned British Steel after emergency legislation was passed through Parliament. The government's next step is likely to nationalize the Scunthorpe plant, which employs 2,700 people. The emergency powers were sought to prevent owners Jingye from shutting down its two blast furnaces, which would have ended primary steel production in the UK. The government hopes to secure private investment to save the loss-making plant but acknowledges there are currently no companies willing to make an offer.</p>
