          <h2>Trump Criticizes Fed Chair Powell as a 'Fool' After Rate Decision</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a 'fool' after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady. Trump believes the Fed should cut rates to stimulate the economy, especially given low inflation and the influx of tariff money. The Fed, however, is holding firm due to economic uncertainties and concerns about potential inflation from Trump's trade policies. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the goal of maximizing employment and price stability, dismissing political pressure from the White House.</p>

          <p>An antisemitism watchdog is calling on FIFA and the White House's FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force to take action against the "Show Israel the Red Card" campaign, which has spread across Europe and other countries. The campaign began at a UEFA Champions League match, with fans displaying banners criticizing Israel's actions in Gaza. The watchdog is urging FIFA President Gianni Infantino to condemn the campaign and President Trump's task force to prevent such displays at the upcoming World Cup.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade deals could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to finalize agreements before a pause on reciprocal tariffs ends. The U.S. has been in negotiations with several countries, including Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. While no specific details have been released, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that deals could be announced this week. China is notably absent from active trade talks, though Bessent is scheduled to meet with a Chinese delegation in Switzerland. Experts anticipate that any potential agreements would likely be nonbinding 'gentlemen's agreements'.</p>

          <p>New York City's financial watchdog is warning that the Trump administration's cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will create an "open season" for scammers. The CFPB has been weakened since Trump took office, leaving consumers vulnerable to predatory lending and fraud. The watchdog is calling on state and local governments to strengthen their consumer protection laws to fill the gap. With the CFPB's oversight diminished, borrowers, especially those with student loans, are at greater risk of unfair practices. The watchdog is urging lawmakers to monitor for deceptive lending, ensure fee transparency, and assist consumers with potential litigation.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is promoting Meta AI as a solution to loneliness and a new frontier for advertising. The new Meta AI app, similar to ChatGPT, uses Meta's Llama models and integrates with Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. However, the app raises significant privacy concerns, as it is designed to be personalized and taps into user data. Experts warn that the app's personalization means surveillance, tracking individual information, and targeting users. With nearly 3.5 billion daily active users, Meta AI is poised to become a pervasive presence, potentially blurring the lines between human interaction and AI-generated content and ads.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the perception of a fully MAGA White House in Trump's second term, certain establishment figures are regaining influence, particularly in economic and foreign policy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, initially appearing hapless, has convinced Trump to pause tariffs and is leading trade negotiations. Marco Rubio, named secretary of state, has also gained prominence, securing key foreign policy jobs. While hardliners remain ascendant in areas like immigration, a tug of war exists in economic and foreign policy, with Trump favoring establishment figures to clean up messes when things get too chaotic. The establishment has learned to work within Trump's decision-making framework, convincing him to make better choices rather than directly opposing him.</p>

          <p>Medicaid payments barely sustain hospital mental health units, and federal cuts could exacerbate the problem. Many U.S. hospitals have been forced to close their inpatient psychiatric units due to financial strain, with Medicaid covering a disproportionately large share of mental health patients. Spencer Hospital in Iowa is one of the few remaining facilities committed to keeping its psychiatric unit open, despite significant annual losses. Experts warn that Medicaid cuts could lead to more people delaying mental health treatment until they reach a crisis point, overwhelming emergency rooms and further straining the system.</p>

Johnston's new book details how lifting weights helped her build emotional strength, repair disordered eating, and enjoy food. She learned that her body could feel good, powerful, and capable of doing things, shifting her attitude from denial to embracing movement, rest, and eating.</p>

The documentary, from Zeteo News, names the soldier as Capt. Alon Scagio, citing another soldier in his squad. Two Israeli military officials confirmed the documentary's conclusions to The New York Times.

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of a fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown. The airport was closed to all flights for much of March 21st after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) said a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation. While power was restored within hours, flights did not resume until later in the day after safety checks. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump briefly announced a 100% tariff on movies made outside America, causing concern in Hollywood before the White House retracted the statement. While Hollywood remains a dominant moviemaking industry with high film exports, it faces challenges such as fewer movies being made in Los Angeles due to cheaper labor and tax credits offered overseas. Trump's proposed tariff aimed to bring moviemaking back to America, but filmmakers argued it would halt production and potentially backfire due to retaliatory levies from other countries. The industry prefers tax credits as an incentive to lure moviemakers back to America.</p>

          <p>This article explains mRNA vaccines, their safety, and their potential in medicine. mRNA vaccines, like those for COVID-19 and RSV, use strands of mRNA to code for specific viral proteins, prompting an immune response. The technology allows for rapid vaccine development and has potential for treating diseases like cancer and cystic fibrosis. The article addresses common concerns about mRNA vaccines, clarifying that they cannot affect DNA. While the COVID-19 vaccine can cause side effects, the risks are outweighed by the benefits of protection against the virus.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs, though it will not be a comprehensive trade agreement. President Trump does not have the authority to sign such an agreement, which would require Congressional approval. The deal is likely to include exemptions or lowering of tariffs on specific goods, but most goods imported from the UK to the US will still face a 10% tariff. Cars are an important part of the deal, and the UK could see a lowering of the 25% tariff or a quota system. The agreement could also address steel and aluminum tariffs and the UK's digital services tax on US firms.</p>
