            <p>Celebre d'Allen, a 13-year-old horse, died after collapsing at the Grand National race at Aintree. The horse was pulled up after the final fence and collapsed on the track. Despite initial signs of recovery after treatment, his condition deteriorated significantly, leading to his death on Tuesday. Jockey Micheal Nolan received a 10-day suspension for continuing the race when the horse appeared unable to continue, though the BHA stated blaming the jockey for the horse's death would be speculative.</p>

            <p>Cambodia faces the highest tariff rate under President Trump's new trade plan, but manufacturers are unlikely to relocate to the U.S. as a result. A trade group representing U.S. interests in Cambodia believes manufacturers will seek alternative locations such as Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia. The 49% tariff rate poses an existential threat to Cambodian factories and workers. Experts anticipate a pause in executive decision-making due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs.</p>

            <p>The UK government has rejected calls for a "buy British" campaign in response to President Trump's tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that such a campaign would be "inward looking" and not in the country's best interests. The government is exploring other options, including potential retaliatory measures and negotiating arrangements to mitigate the tariffs. The government has also set out new rules aimed at making it easier for small and medium-sized British companies to bid for government contracts.</p>

            <p>President Trump is expected to sign executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry, using emergency authority to allow older coal-fired power plants to continue operating. This move responds to increased US power demand from data centers, AI, and electric cars. The action contrasts with the Biden administration's climate rules requiring cuts in carbon pollution from coal-fired plants. Environmentalists have expressed dismay, arguing that Trump is prioritizing outdated energy sources.</p>

            <p>A full-scale trade war between the US and China is a growing possibility, with President Trump threatening tariffs of over 100% on Chinese goods. China has vowed to "fight to the end" and has already raised trade barriers against the US. This escalating conflict could significantly impact the world economy, potentially increasing prices for consumers and disrupting global supply chains. The article also highlights potential ways for both nations to inflict economic damage beyond tariffs.</p>

            <p>Barclays has abandoned gender and ethnicity targets for its US staff, becoming the latest UK company to respond to Donald Trump's anti-diversity push. Managers will no longer be required to consider how new hires and promotions advance the careers of women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds. The bank cited a review of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) approach as the reason for the decision. This action reflects a broader trend of companies scaling back DEI efforts in response to political pressure.</p>

Stefanik's future role in the Trump administration remains uncertain, but her loyalty could lead to a higher position.</p>

            <p>US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on goods imported from the rest of the world. Trump claims that a 10% tariff on all nations and much higher rates of up to 50% on individual countries will boost the US economy and protect jobs. Many economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs.</p>
