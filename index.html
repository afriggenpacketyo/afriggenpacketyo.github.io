          <p>Top European Union leaders met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic ties, though the summit was marked by significant underlying tensions. The EU expressed grievances over imbalanced market access, China's industrial subsidies, and its stance on the war in Ukraine, leading to a downscaled, one-day event. While Chinese state media emphasized partnership, Brussels framed the talks as a chance for frank discussion on all aspects of the complex relationship. Both sides navigate these disagreements amid a challenging global landscape, including aggressive US trade policies.</p>

          <p>An oceanography student at Scripps Institute of Oceanography discovered a rare violet sea snail, or Janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not seen locally in a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their vibrant purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically inhabit warmer tropical waters. The sighting coincided with unusually warm coastal water temperatures, prompting researchers to consider a potential link to climate change. While a direct connection is unconfirmed, scientists are now on alert for more such occurrences as a possible indicator of shifting ocean conditions.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge is attributed to robust demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence systems used by tech giants like Nvidia. The company projects that strong AI investment will continue to fuel growth for the remainder of the year and plans to double its HBM sales compared to 2024. This performance solidifies SK Hynix's leadership in the advanced memory market, intensifying competition with rivals Samsung and Micron. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five men from Las Vegas have been sentenced for their involvement in "Jetflicks," one of the largest illegal streaming services ever prosecuted in the United States. The enterprise offered over 183,000 pirated television episodes to tens of thousands of subscribers, causing millions in losses to copyright holders. The defendants used automated software to illegally download and distribute content, often making it available just a day after its original airing. Their sentences range from time served to seven years in federal prison, marking a significant outcome in the fight against digital piracy.</p>

          <p>New regulations under the UK's Online Safety Act now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age verification for users. Methods suggested by the regulator, Ofcom, include credit card checks or ID matching, with non-compliant sites facing fines up to £18 million. However, critics and users express concerns about the privacy of their personal data and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs. While the goal is to protect children from accessing harmful material, experts worry the rules may push users to less secure platforms and question the overall effectiveness of the measures.</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly refuted media reports claiming President Donald Trump is named in unreleased Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson characterized the claims as a continuation of politically motivated stories, while not explicitly denying the president's name appears in the documents. The reports emerged as a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury files from a 2006 Epstein investigation, citing state secrecy laws. This development occurs amid increasing pressure on the administration to disclose more information about the case.</p>

They argue the release misrepresents previous findings and irresponsibly risks exposing sensitive intelligence sources and methods.

          <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found that the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from historical legal principles. This ruling upholds a lower court's block on the policy, though the White House has stated it will appeal.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the influential and iconic frontman of Black Sabbath who has died at 76, helped create the genre of heavy metal. Reacting against the "hippy" music of the late 1960s, the working-class band from Birmingham developed a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, born from a factory accident that severed his fingertips, created the detuned, powerful riffs that became the genre's foundation. From their self-titled debut to seminal albums like "Paranoid," Black Sabbath's music defined a new frontier for rock, influencing countless bands for decades to come.</p>

However, he now states that he prefers playing in the field because it keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This marks a significant change from his time in Boston, where he reportedly shut down the idea of playing first base after being told in spring training to focus exclusively on hitting.</p>

          <p>A group of Venezuelan migrants, deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, have been released and sent to Caracas, providing the first detailed accounts of life inside. The men, who the Trump administration alleged were gang members, described systematic beatings, isolation, and psychological abuse by guards. They were held incommunicado in crowded cells and staged a hunger strike to protest the brutal conditions. Their release was part of a prisoner swap negotiated between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, shedding light on the harsh realities of the high-security prison.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals a growing trend of teenagers using AI companions like ChatGPT for friendship, emotional support, and personal advice. Over 70% of teens have used these platforms, with many finding the interactions as or more satisfying than talking to human friends. Researchers and psychologists are concerned this could hinder the development of crucial real-world social skills, critical thinking, and emotional resilience. They worry that relying on AI that is always available and agreeable may leave teens unprepared for the complexities and challenges of human relationships.</p>

          <p>In the first six months of President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since 2014. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting an annual total over 300,000. This significant increase is driven by a sweeping mandate to crack down on illegal immigration, yet it still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations. With a recent massive funding increase, ICE plans to hire more agents and expand detention capacity, suggesting enforcement could intensify further.</p>

The move reflects growing pressure for transparency following a recent DOJ review that claimed no "incriminating client list" existed and that Epstein died by suicide.

          <p>While the U.S. housing market remains favorable to sellers, some realtors are observing a subtle shift that may provide a small opening for buyers. An increase in the number of homes for sale, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, is causing some properties to stay on the market longer. Despite this, median home prices hit a record high in June, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low mortgage rates to sell. Experts advise prospective buyers to look for properties that have been on the market for a while or consider fixer-uppers in good neighborhoods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new "AI Action Plan" signals a clear strategy of prioritizing rapid, unregulated innovation by the private sector to achieve global dominance in artificial intelligence. The plan, heavily influenced by recommendations from major tech firms like OpenAI and Google, calls for stripping away environmental and state-level regulations to accelerate the construction of data centers. It frames AI development as a race against China and a key to military preeminence. Critics argue the plan is a giveaway to tech billionaires that sacrifices public interest and sensible safeguards for corporate profit and speed.</p>
