          <p>Shenzhen-based UBTech Robotics, a leading Chinese manufacturer of humanoid robots, is planning to raise approximately $307 million through a new share placement in Hong Kong. The funds are intended for general business operations, development, and debt repayment as the company continues its fundraising efforts since its late 2023 listing. This move will dilute the company's existing share capital by about 6.39 percent. Following the announcement, the company's shares experienced a notable drop in morning trading.

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has threatened former President Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment for allegedly violating a ban on using social media. The warning came after Bolsonaro's allies circulated a video of a speech he gave, which the judge contends was intended for social media distribution. Justice Alexandre de Moraes had previously ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and stay off social media due to an investigation into an alleged coup plot. The incident has sparked debate in Brazil over the extent of social media bans for public figures.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi military training jet crashed into a school in the capital, Dhaka, resulting in the deaths of at least 27 people, many of whom were students. The F-7 jet reportedly suffered a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff, and the pilot, who was also killed, attempted to steer it away from crowded areas. The incident, which injured over 170 people, marks the country's deadliest aviation disaster in decades. An investigation has been launched as the nation observes a day of mourning for the victims.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first-ever sanctions targeting people-smuggling operations, a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's strategy to curb illegal Channel crossings. The measures will freeze the assets of and impose travel bans on gang leaders, corrupt officials, and companies supplying equipment like small boats. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the goal is to disrupt the criminal gangs profiting from vulnerable migrants. This new approach aims to tackle immigration crime where traditional law enforcement has been unable to reach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly favored tariffs over traditional sanctions as its primary tool for economic leverage, creating global market uncertainty. Unlike sanctions, which often require international cooperation and can completely block markets, tariffs can be unilaterally imposed by the president and generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury. This approach aligns with Trump's "America First" agenda to protect domestic industries, but critics warn it blurs the lines between trade policy and punitive measures. The article notes this strategy risks destabilizing global trade and international relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In recent interviews, Hunter Biden has launched sharp criticisms against figures within the Democratic party, media personalities like CNN's Jake Tapper, and actor George Clooney. President Biden's son attributed the 2024 election loss to a lack of loyalty to his father and condemned those who, in his view, abandoned the successful administration. He also dismissed Clooney's political influence and pushed back against conspiracies regarding his past drug use and his father's health. The commentary marks a departure from typical Democratic messaging and mirrors the grievance-focused politics often seen from his political opponents.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Ana Schnabl critiques the expectation from Western publishers that authors from the Balkans must focus on themes of war, trauma, and regional tragedy. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to write about "problematic" or "traumatic" aspects of her culture to appeal to American readers. Schnabl argues this pigeonholes writers and reinforces a perception of the Balkans as a "lesser place" defined by its historical suffering. She calls for publishers to embrace a wider diversity of stories from the region, beyond those that simply serve an explanatory or didactic purpose.</p>

Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before a claim is settled.

          <p>According to analysis from property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by £221 over the past three years. This sharp 21% increase is attributed to high tenant demand and a shortage of available rental properties. The rising costs are forcing some individuals to make career decisions based on local rent affordability and leading parents to help their adult children with living expenses. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, particularly in cities, rents in more affordable areas continue to climb sharply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of a 61-year-old man who died after being pulled into an MRI machine on Long Island claims the facility's technician is to blame for the fatal accident. Keith McAllister was accompanying his wife for a scan when the technician allegedly invited him into the room without warning him about the machine's powerful magnetic field. The family states that a metal chain McAllister was wearing caused him to be instantly pulled into the machine, where he remained stuck for nearly an hour. He later died from several heart attacks following the incident.</p>

          <h2>Preliminary Report on Fatal Air India Crash Sparks Controversy Over Cockpit Audio</h2>

          <p>The preliminary report into the Air India crash that killed 260 people has generated more speculation than closure, focusing on a critical moment in the cockpit. Data shows both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off" seconds after takeoff, causing total power loss. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he did it, with the other denying the action, though it's unclear who said what. This detail has led to intense media speculation about pilot error, which Indian pilot associations and investigators have condemned as premature and irresponsible while the full investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for using excessive force during the 2020 raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor. Although his 10 shots did not strike anyone, they recklessly entered a neighboring apartment. The judge's sentence went against a Department of Justice recommendation for no prison time, stating that such a light sentence would minimize the jury's verdict. Hankison is the only officer to face criminal conviction in connection with the fatal raid, which sparked nationwide protests against police brutality.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The program grants temporary protection from deportation and work permits to individuals whose home countries are deemed unsafe. While the court acknowledged the plaintiffs have a plausible case, it found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues.

          <p>Critics, including former Republican congressman Joe Walsh and Rev. Al Sharpton, are accusing President Trump of attempting to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. They point to a recent flurry of unrelated and inflammatory social media posts from the president, such as demanding the Washington Commanders change their name back. The accusations come as the administration faces backlash for its handling of files related to Epstein, with some of Trump's own supporters angered by a perceived lack of transparency. The White House has maintained that the president is being transparent with his base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, Donald Trump's universal tariffs may have an unintended positive consequence. The author suggests that the economic pressure from these tariffs is compelling countries like Canada and China, as well as the European Union, to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. These domestic protectionist policies have been a significant drag on their economies. The tariff crisis, therefore, could be inadvertently spurring valuable and overdue economic reforms and liberalization in these nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old musician noted he still struggles with his balance but that the condition feels less severe than the "brain disorder" label suggests. Joel was forced to cancel numerous tour dates in May after doctors advised that recent performances had exacerbated his condition. NPH involves a build-up of fluid in the brain and can affect mobility, vision, and hearing.</p>
