          <p>Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner recognized for his heroic service after 9/11, has died at the age of 69 after battling an illness. Kerik rose to national prominence during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, coordinating emergency response efforts alongside then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Despite his distinguished 35-year career and numerous awards, Kerik pleaded guilty to eight felonies in 2009, including tax fraud, and spent nearly three years in prison. He was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020 and later became a vocal critic of the criminal justice system, also working with Giuliani to investigate claims of election fraud after the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>The coastal rail line connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume service on June 7 after undergoing nearly six weeks of reinforcement work to mitigate landslide and coastal erosion risks. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction last month to stabilize the rail line, which serves both Metrolink commuter trains and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner. Crews have placed thousands of tons of boulders along the rail line to absorb water flow and stabilize potential runoff, and are preparing to construct a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail. The Orange County Transportation Authority estimates the total cost of these projects at approximately $300 million, acknowledging the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs.</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old mother with stage 4 colorectal cancer, Natalie Phelps, reports experiencing life-threatening delays in her treatment due to cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Phelps, participating in a cell-based immunotherapy trial at the NIH, was informed that her treatment would be delayed by several weeks due to staff reductions resulting from funding cuts. This delay has caused significant stress, as her cancer has progressed, and the tumor size affects her eligibility for the trial. The situation has sparked a dispute between Senator Patty Murray and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with Murray questioning the impact of the cuts on patient care and Kennedy initially claiming Phelps was medically ineligible, a claim Phelps disputes.</p>

          <p>China has revealed the world's first AI-powered nuclear inspector, developed by researchers at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The technology aims to strengthen Beijing's position in international disarmament talks, but also raises questions about AI's role in managing weapons of mass destruction. The project faced challenges including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and ensuring the system wouldn't leak technical secrets. So far, only the initial step of training and testing the AI has been completed, as specific data cannot be disclosed due to the classified nature of nuclear warheads.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership due to White House frustrations with the agency's arrest and deportation numbers. Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), is retiring, and Robert Hammer, who leads ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), has been reassigned. Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon, both career ICE officials, will replace them, with ICE describing the changes as a "leadership realignment" to support its increasing operational tempo. The White House has been pressuring ICE to increase arrests of migrants living in the U.S. illegally, with Stephen Miller advocating for a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day.</p>

This has resulted in reduced produce purchases from local growers and a loss of aid for food banks, exacerbating the hunger crisis.

However, the Hamas official said the proposal did not satisfy core demands, including an end to the war, and that it would respond in due course. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza and resumed its military offensive against Hamas on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued pardons and commutations for several convicted fraudsters, claiming they were unfairly targeted for being his supporters. Those pardoned include reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, former Rep. Michael Grimm, and former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins. Additionally, Trump pardoned Devon Archer and commuted the sentence of Jason Galanis, both former business partners of Hunter Biden. Other pardons include former Illinois Gov.

          <p>The Trump administration will begin revoking visas for some Chinese international students, particularly those in "critical fields," according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The government also plans to revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. condemned the move, stating it is a "politically motivated and discriminatory action" that undermines the rights of Chinese students and damages the reputation of the U.S. The action comes amid increasing scrutiny of ties between U.S. higher education and China.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are back in place, at least temporarily, following an appeals court ruling that allows his administration to continue collecting import fees. The decision reverses a previous court ruling that deemed Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt criticized the initial ruling, stating that America cannot function when diplomatic or trade negotiations are "railroaded by activist judges". The legal battle over the tariffs continues, creating uncertainty for businesses and international trade relations.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily suspend a lower court's order that found the bulk of his global tariffs to be illegal. The White House criticized the lower court's decision, calling it judicial overreach, and argued that it threatened to unravel months of trade negotiations. The appeals court decision allows the tariffs to be used while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5. Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro stated that the administration would find another way to implement tariffs even if they lose in court.</p>

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona, citing concerns over a judge's impartiality. The decision came after one of the judges stepped down due to criticism surrounding her participation in a documentary series about the case. The judges decided to retry the entire case, turning the clock back on all proceedings since March 11. The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, a senior UN official stated that there is little hope that the discussions would lead to a deal to halt fighting. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused Russia of engaging in "yet another deception" by failing to present its peace settlement proposal ahead of a potential meeting between the two sides. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and the destruction of large parts of eastern and southern Ukraine.
