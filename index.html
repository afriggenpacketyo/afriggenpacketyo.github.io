This meeting occurs in the context of a previous, tense encounter where Trump and Vice President JD Vance had accused Zelenskyy of not being sufficiently grateful for American assistance.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have officially named veteran Joe Flacco as their starting quarterback for the first week of the NFL season. The Super Bowl champion secured the position over rookie quarterbacks Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel, who had competed for the role during the preseason. Flacco, who is entering his 18th season, brings extensive experience in head coach Kevin Stefanski’s offensive system. Last season, he started six games for the Indianapolis Colts after an injury to their starting quarterback.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt and Qatar. The framework reportedly involves a two-stage, 60-day truce during which about half of the remaining Israeli hostages would be released, followed by negotiations for a permanent end to hostilities. However, Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once, and his cabinet is expected to approve plans to expand military operations into Gaza City.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to the state capitol, ending their quorum break and allowing the legislature to proceed with a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps. This move has national implications, as California Democrats are simultaneously advancing their own redistricting plan to counteract potential Republican gains. The article also notes that the White House is actively encouraging other Republican-controlled states, such as Indiana, to pursue similar mid-decade redistricting to bolster the party's U.S. House majority.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-time leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled to plead guilty in a Brooklyn federal court to extensive drug trafficking charges. The indictment accuses him of overseeing a violent global operation involving torture, murder, and the mass distribution of illicit drugs into the United States. His expected plea follows his arrest in Texas last year, an event that has reportedly triggered brutal infighting between cartel factions loyal to him and those aligned with the sons of his former partner, "El Chapo" Guzmán.</p>

          <p>Experts advise seniors considering a reverse mortgage to carefully weigh their age, home equity, and long-term financial plans. Generally, older borrowers in their late 60s or early 70s can access a larger portion of their home's value, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy and thus less time for interest to accrue. However, it's crucial to evaluate immediate income needs against the goals of aging in place and potentially leaving the home as an inheritance for heirs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cable news channel MSNBC is undergoing a significant rebranding, changing its name to MS NOW and dropping the iconic NBC peacock logo. This change is part of a larger corporate restructuring where MSNBC, along with CNBC and other networks, will be spun off from NBC Universal into a new independent company called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a distinct identity for the network as it moves forward as a separate entity.</p>

          <p>Several European leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, have traveled to Washington to participate in talks between the U.S. and Ukraine. Their primary goal is to prevent President Trump from pressuring Ukraine into accepting a peace deal that might involve ceding territory, a concern that arose after Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The European contingent aims to reinforce the continent's broader security interests and ensure that any potential peace agreement does not amount to what they term a "capitulation" to Russian demands.</p>

          <p>A strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants has been declared illegal by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which has ordered the employees to immediately return to work. The strike, now in its third day, has caused widespread disruption during the peak summer travel season, affecting an estimated 130,000 passengers daily. The union had previously defied an earlier back-to-work order as it remains in a dispute with the airline over pay and other contract issues, prompting government intervention.</p>

          <p>Germany's Football Federation (DFB) has opened an investigation into two separate incidents of alleged racist abuse directed at players during German Cup matches over the weekend. One match involving Schalke was briefly halted after a player reported abuse from the stands, while in another game, a player warming up on the sideline was reportedly insulted by a fan. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has condemned the incidents and called on the DFB to take appropriate action against the perpetrators.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its widely used diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to U.S. patients who pay in cash. This price is less than half of the medication's current monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The move aims to increase access for uninsured or underinsured patients and comes amid significant political pressure on drugmakers to lower prescription costs. This new pricing model is also intended to discourage patients from turning to potentially unsafe, unregulated compounded versions of the drug.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has strongly criticized a proposal by California Democrats to redraw the state's congressional district map, labeling it an "illegal power grab." In a public statement, Johnson announced that he has directed the National Republican Congressional Committee to use all available resources to challenge the new map. This development is part of an escalating partisan battle over redistricting, with the California proposal being a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort to redraw maps in Texas ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
