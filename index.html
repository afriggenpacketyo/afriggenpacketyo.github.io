          <p>The Supreme Court will hear a case involving Trina Martin, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by FBI agents. The agents stormed her home, pointing guns at her and her boyfriend while her son screamed. Martin is suing the government for assault, battery, and false arrest, arguing that Congress intended to allow such lawsuits. The case raises questions about accountability for law enforcement and the circumstances under which individuals can sue the federal government.</p>
