          <p>During a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, former President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" and indicated that a deal had been reached that would protect American jobs and ensure U.S. Steel remains under American control, though specifics remain unclear. Trump announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the existing 25%, aiming to bolster the domestic steel industry. Trump stated Nippon Steel would invest $14 billion, with funds allocated to increase steel production in Pittsburgh and modernize facilities across several states, and emphasized that U.S. Steel would maintain its blast furnaces at full capacity for at least 10 years. Trump claimed that the deal would bring more jobs for Americans and promised a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, upholding a lower court's injunction. The ruling prevents the Department of Government Efficiency from downsizing the federal workforce, keeping the cuts on hold for the time being. The court stated that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution, and the administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by a California judge in response to a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities. The judge's order questioned the legality of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce, which has already seen tens of thousands of workers leave or be placed on leave. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, potentially impacting millions who rely on the program. The proposal aims to address rising Medi-Cal costs by requiring applicants to prove their assets total less than $2,000, including the value of a primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. Health and disability advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing it would force older adults and people with disabilities into extreme poverty and result in loss of coverage. Newsom defended the proposed cuts as necessary to balance the budget, while advocates warn that the policy could lead to higher costs in the long run due to worsened health conditions and increased need for nursing facility care.</p>

Musk dismissed the report, questioning the credibility of the New York Times, and the report claimed Musk used ketamine as often as once a day during the 2024 campaign, and Musk has previously stated he has a prescription for ketamine, using it infrequently to manage a "depressive mindstate." Musk's departure from his role overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) coincided with criticism of his cost-cutting measures, with some analysts suggesting DOGE may end up costing the government due to lost productivity. Despite some disagreements with Trump's agenda, Musk was praised by the former president, who said Musk's role "has been without comparison in modern history."</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey stated that UK defence spending is projected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, as the government prepares to unveil its strategic defence review. The review will outline priorities for military and security spending in the coming years, recommending the deployment of new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and control future unmanned weapons. The Ministry of Defence will spend over Â£1 billion to develop technology to speed up battlefield decisions, with new funding partly sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income. NATO heads of government are expected to meet next month to discuss increasing defence spending among allies.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is warning consumers to beware of scam websites claiming to sell rice at heavily discounted prices, as complaints related to such sites have spiked since March. The National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan reports that some consumers have paid for rice that was never delivered, and the warning comes as the average price of rice at supermarkets has steadily risen due to a poor harvest. The government's attempt to curb prices by releasing rice stockpiles has had a limited impact, and the center advises consumers to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid buying from websites with unrealistically low prices. The government aims to reduce prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kg by early June.</p>

          <p>Approximately 250 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The commercial truck hauling the honeybees rolled over, causing the hives to come off the truck and freeing the bees, and authorities are urging the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. Beekeepers are assisting with the rescue effort, aiming to save as many of the bees as possible, and authorities expect the road where the truck overturned to be closed for 24 to 48 hours. By morning, most bees should have returned to their hives and those responsible for their delivery will be in charge.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing rising prices and a decline in casual tourism, with higher costs for visitors impacting the city's appeal as a bargain destination. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported a decrease in visitors in March and April compared to the previous year, and hotel occupancy has also slipped, despite an increase in average nightly rates. The city is seeing fewer international visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more, and construction and road closures are causing traffic congestion, deterring some tourists. While big resorts can absorb some empty rooms at higher prices, the changing dynamics reflect a drop in consumer confidence and the perception that Las Vegas is no longer an affordable vacation.</p>

          <p>A new aid distribution scheme in Gaza, backed by the US and Israel and operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has faced criticism and chaotic scenes. The GHF aims to bypass the UN as the main aid supplier but has been condemned and boycotted by aid agencies. The first few days of operation were marked by disorganization, with videos showing distribution centers overrun by desperate civilians and reports of GHF contractors using non-lethal deterrents to manage crowds. Concerns have been raised about the location of distribution sites, the presence of armed security, and the limited scope of aid provided, with some characterizing the GHF-led operation as imposing "military control over aid operations."</p>

On May 13, a United Airlines flight veered into the path of a SkyWest Airlines flight during departure without authorization. The United flight, an Airbus A320 headed for Dallas-Fort Worth International, made a sharp turn to the left instead of turning right, coming within 0.4 nautical miles horizontally and 280 feet vertically of the SkyWest flight, a CRJ-200 headed to Fresno-Yosemite International. United Airlines stated it is reviewing the incident, and the FAA's investigation is ongoing, with initial information subject to change.</p>

Professional medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to recommend COVID vaccines for children and pregnant women, based on scientific evidence of their safety and effectiveness.

The article notes that the questions failed to address Musk's sweeping policy changes, including job cuts and department closures, and focused instead on trivial matters. The author also criticized the lack of follow-up on serious allegations, such as Musk's alleged drug use, and the media's compliance in allowing Musk to avoid accountability. The piece contrasts the gentle questioning with the immense power Musk wielded during his time in the Trump administration, arguing that the press failed to hold power to account.</p>

The lawsuit alleges unlawful interference in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and multiple violations of the First Amendment, including viewpoint discrimination and encroachment on press freedoms. The executive order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS," claiming the two news organizations have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda. PBS argues that the executive order would profoundly impact its ability to provide diverse programming to all Americans, while the Trump administration alleges that NPR and PBS have failed to provide fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while decreasing reliance on China. Trump also said that $14 billion would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel. The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue after the Court of International Trade had ordered the administration to halt the taxes.
