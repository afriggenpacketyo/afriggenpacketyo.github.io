While HELOC rates are expected to decrease in tandem with potential Fed rate cuts due to their link to the Prime Rate, home equity loan rates are anticipated to remain stable. Experts recommend homeowners focus on their true purpose for borrowing, long-term financial goals, and ability to handle payments, rather than solely fixating on interest rates.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that quantum computing is reaching an "inflection point," suggesting that these machines will soon be capable of solving real-world problems. Quantum computers use quantum mechanics to tackle complex problems that classical computers cannot handle. The technology employs qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling the processing of vast amounts of data. This announcement has sparked investor interest in quantum computing stocks, such as Rigetti Computing and IonQ, indicating growing confidence in the field's potential. The optimism surrounding quantum computing reflects the expectation of breakthroughs in medicine, science, and finance.</p>

The agreement involves Kosovo temporarily hosting 50 deportees while facilitating their return to their home countries. This arrangement is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to convince countries to accept migrants who are not their citizens, often those whose home countries refuse to take them back. The U.S. State Department has expressed gratitude to Kosovo for its cooperation on this matter. This agreement highlights the complex dynamics of international migration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are advancing President Trump's agenda to overhaul the student loan system, targeting Biden's expansion of Borrower Defense to Repayment and Closed School Discharge regulations. The bill seeks to end what Republicans call costly policies that shift federal student loan burdens onto taxpayers. It also proposes eliminating federal Grad PLUS loans and establishing a Workforce Pell Grant to encourage non-collegiate degrees. The legislation aims to crack down on taxpayer funding for degrees from lower-performing universities, blocking federal student loan programs for colleges where graduates earn less than those without degrees. The proposed changes aim to save taxpayers approximately $300 billion.</p>

Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve will maintain steady interest rates at its upcoming meeting.

The unrest, described by police as "racist thuggery," began after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Riot officers were deployed, and a water cannon was used to disperse protesters, with several cars set on fire and homes damaged. The Prime Minister condemned the violence, and First Minister Michelle O'Neill labeled it as "pure racism." The police have urged those involved to reflect on their actions, and an investigation is underway to identify offenders.</p>

          <p>President Trump's agenda, including budget cuts and tariffs, is significantly altering the battle between U.S. states for business. States that previously relied on federal funding are now facing challenges, while those less dependent on the federal government are faring better. The trade war is disrupting states heavily reliant on international trade, creating both risks and opportunities. Foreign companies are seeking to establish manufacturing operations in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, and domestic companies are relocating in burgeoning industries like AI and quantum computing. States are emphasizing economic strength and stability to attract businesses in this evolving environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Russia now primarily sells its oil to China and India, maintaining revenue streams to fund its economy. The Ukrainian President has called for the ceiling to be halved to $30 dollars per barrel.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts argue that President Trump's deployment of troops and Marines to Los Angeles was a long-planned strategy, stemming from his regret over not taking a more forceful approach to the 2020 protests. They see the situation as a "test case" for exerting federal authority over cities that resist his agenda, particularly on immigration. The deployment is viewed as a way to bring state and local officials to heel, tap resources for deportation efforts, and target protesters. This action has sparked concerns about the erosion of civil rights and the boundaries of legality.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of Congress are introducing the My Body, My Data Act to limit companies' ability to collect and share data about individuals' reproductive health. The bill aims to protect women from potential persecution in the post-Roe v Wade era by restricting the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of reproductive health information. This provision would apply to data related to pregnancy, menstruation, abortion, and contraception. The legislation seeks to address concerns about law enforcement using data trails to identify abortion seekers and the increasing surveillance of online reproductive health activities.

          <p>The right to wear masks during protests is being debated, especially in light of President Trump's opposition, despite ICE agents using face coverings. While civil disobedience requires revealing one's identity, the current media landscape and potential for retribution make anonymity a cautious choice. The Supreme Court has previously defended the right to anonymity as a means to protect individuals from retaliation. However, there is a sense that an asymmetry between the masked and unmasked can be problematic when engaging with others. It should be up to individuals to decide how much they want to reveal to authorities and fellow citizens.</p>

Pochettino has taken responsibility for the team's poor performance, and has expressed doubt over whether his approach to the job is enough to prevent the US from being embarrassed at home again.

          <p>Inflation showed little change last month as President Trump's tariffs have so far not had a big effect on the prices that American shoppers pay. Consumer prices in May were up 2.4% from a year ago, according to a report Wednesday from the Labor Department. That's a slightly larger annual increase than the month before, however, prices rose just 0.1% between April and May â€” down from 0.2% the month before. Falling gasoline prices helped to offset the rising cost of rent and groceries. The president has imposed an import tax of at least 10% on nearly everything the U.S. buys from other countries, and that tax rate could increase next month, at the conclusion of a 90-day window for trade negotiations.</p>
