          <p>Officials in Los Angeles County have confirmed that a grenade is missing following a deadly explosion at a training facility that killed three sheriff's deputies. The deputies had recovered two grenades from a garage, believing them to be inert, but one detonated the next morning. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the search for the second device, which investigators believe was brought to the facility. In response to the tragedy, the department has updated its policies to treat all explosive devices as live and has temporarily suspended its bomb squad's operations.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' World Food Programme has issued a stark warning that nearly one-third of Gaza's population is experiencing days without eating, leading to a surge in malnutrition. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, the death toll from malnutrition has now reached 122. The crisis is intensifying amid international calls for Israel to lift restrictions on aid, with Germany, France, and the UK issuing a joint statement demanding an end to the humanitarian catastrophe. A former US security contractor has also alleged witnessing war crimes, claiming Israeli forces and US contractors used indiscriminate force against civilians at food distribution sites.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, according to a source familiar with the matter. The task force is an influential panel that provides evidence-based recommendations on clinical preventive services like cancer screenings, which are then required to be covered by insurance. The source indicated that Kennedy views the independent group as being too “woke.” While an HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made, a scheduled meeting for the task force was abruptly canceled earlier this month without explanation.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. The project, which now awaits final approval, is anticipated to be operational after 2030 and represents a major push towards more fuel-efficient power sources. This development places China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, which are also actively developing advanced reactor technologies. The milestone was announced at an event in Fuzhou, attended by key officials from China's national energy and atomic authorities.</p>

          <p>A double-decker bus traveling from Lima, Peru, veered off a road and fell into a ravine, killing at least 15 people and injuring approximately 30 others. The vehicle, which was carrying over 60 passengers, crashed and landed on its roof near a river in the Palca district. Authorities are currently working to identify the deceased and are investigating the cause of the accident. Bus crashes are a recurring issue in Peru, with previous reports from the Attorney General's Office citing recklessness, excessive speed, and poor road conditions as the primary contributing factors to such fatal incidents.</p>

The demonstrators rallied under the banner "The Republic is a large prison," criticizing the erosion of democratic institutions and the climate of fear. July 25, once celebrated as Republic Day, is now viewed by opponents as a symbol of the country's democratic decline.</p>

The departures come as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and navigates a period of leadership uncertainty.

Over 220 MPs signed a letter advocating for recognition, a step France has already committed to.

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The boom is largely attributed to an abundance of aphids, a primary food source, which flourished in the warm conditions. However, the corresponding lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying up wetlands and affecting egg-laying. While this year has been visibly bountiful for insects, experts note that the long-term trend for the UK's flying insect population remains one of significant decline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago over its sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents unlawfully thwarted federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins stated that the city's policies do not improperly regulate ICE operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, affirming that the city cannot be compelled to participate in what they termed a "reckless and inhumane immigration agenda."</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society is examining the legacy of the Hollywood blacklist, which emerged from the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigations into alleged Communist influence in the 1940s. The exhibit focuses on the story of the Hollywood Ten, a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It explores how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled industry figures to name names, and extended beyond Hollywood to affect ordinary Americans. The display highlights questions about free speech and democracy that remain relevant today.</p>

          <p>For President Donald Trump, golf is more than a pastime; it serves as a business venture, a competitive outlet, and a crucial tool for networking and diplomacy. Unlike predecessors who used the sport for diversion, Trump leverages his golf courses to host political allies, business leaders, and foreign dignitaries, often away from public scrutiny. He owns numerous high-profile courses and has used the game to forge relationships with world leaders like former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Insiders describe him as a fiercely competitive player who uses the sport as a transactional space to make connections and conduct business.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity before being questioned for nine hours by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, according to sources familiar with the meeting. This "proffer immunity" allowed Maxwell to answer questions without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell's attorney stated that she was asked about approximately 100 different people and answered every question without promises of clemency. The high-level meeting is unusual and comes as the Justice Department faces pressure to release more information about the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, a species whose population has been decimated by disease. Over the last five years, about 50% of the native sheep have been lost to a disease spread from non-native animals. In a rescue effort, biologists captured healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd and airlifted them to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent check confirmed the relocated herd is not only surviving but growing, with the birth of new lambs offering hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>Commonly cited health guidelines, such as walking 10,000 steps or drinking eight glasses of water per day, are being re-examined by health and wellness experts. While a recent study suggests 7,000 steps may be sufficient, specialists offer nuanced perspectives on other targets. For instance, some kidney specialists argue that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most healthy people. However, experts are less flexible on sleep, emphasizing that seven to nine hours is vital for long-term health. The consensus suggests that while benchmarks are useful, a balanced, consistent approach to overall health is more important than rigidly hitting every number.</p>

Experts argue that watching real people navigate complex situations can help viewers build empathy, gain insights into social cues, and even feel less isolated. However, they also stress the critical importance of ensuring adequate care for show participants.</p>
