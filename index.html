          <p>President Trump has announced the deployment of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, to address what he described as "lawless mayhem" from protests against immigration enforcement. The administration aims to restore order and protect federal property, which has been the site of clashes between protestors and law enforcement. The Oregon Military Department confirmed 200 service members are mobilized under federal authority, despite the Portland Mayor's claims that the city is peaceful and that footage of violence is outdated. The move highlights the ongoing tension between federal and local authorities over sanctuary city policies and protest management.</p>

          <p>FIFA is contemplating scheduling 2026 World Cup matches involving European nations after midnight UK time to mitigate extreme heat issues in the host cities across North America. This consideration follows complaints from managers and players about midday games in near-40-degree temperatures during the recent Club World Cup. While late kickoffs would be less than ideal for European broadcasters, organizers are prioritizing player welfare. A top FIFA official acknowledged that scheduling is a major challenge, and they are in discussions with media partners to find the best compromise for the 48-team tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $18 billion in federal funds for two major New York City infrastructure projects, the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway. The White House's budget office cited a review into "unconstitutional DEI principles" as the reason for the hold, which is delayed by the government shutdown. Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who represent New York, condemned the move as a politically motivated attack that jeopardizes thousands of union jobs and harms the national economy. The action intensifies the political conflict on the first day of the government shutdown.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have benched quarterback Joe Flacco in favor of rookie Dillon Gabriel, who will make his first NFL start against the Minnesota Vikings. Despite speculation, Shedeur Sanders, son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, will remain the team's third-string quarterback. When questioned about the decision after recently stating he was capable of better play than others in the league, Sanders responded by silently mouthing answers to the media before the interview was cut short. The move comes as the 1-3 Browns struggle with an offense ranked near the bottom of the league in scoring.</p>

          <p>Due to the federal government shutdown, the Department of Justice has filed a motion to postpone all deadlines in the deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was previously wrongly deported. The DOJ stated that its attorneys are prohibited from working during the funding lapse, except in emergencies, and has requested an extension equivalent to the duration of the shutdown. Abrego Garcia, who was brought back to the U.S. to face separate charges, does not consent to the delay. His case highlights the immediate impact of the shutdown on the judicial system and immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>Activists aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla, a convoy of boats carrying symbolic humanitarian aid to Gaza, have reported that the Israeli navy has begun intercepting their vessels. The flotilla, which includes prominent figures like Greta Thunberg and aims to break the Israeli blockade, was hailed by naval ships and told to stop. The Israeli Foreign Ministry stated the boats were approaching an "active combat zone" and offered to transfer the aid through other channels. The incident raises complex questions about international maritime law and the legality of the Gaza blockade, with activists asserting their right to provide humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $20 billion loan to Argentina to help stabilize its currency, a move seen as a pragmatic exception to its "America First" rhetoric. The article supports the bailout, arguing that the success of President Javier Milei's free-market reforms is crucial for promoting economic and political liberalism in Latin America. While Milei has made significant progress in curbing inflation, a mismanaged currency devaluation has jeopardized his agenda. The proposed loan, from a long-standing Federal Reserve credit line, is presented as a wise risk to prevent Argentina's economic collapse and discredit authoritarianism in the region.

          <p>The government shutdown is drawing attention to the economic ripple effects of federal cost-cutting measures, such as the cancellation of hundreds of office leases nationwide under the DOGE initiative. While intended to save money, these cancellations are destabilizing local commercial real estate markets, as government tenants were once considered a secure source of income for landlords. Experts warn that the loss of these anchor tenants can impact the broader commercial lending market, as many of the property loans are bundled into investment securities.

The article posits that Trump's subversion of constitutional norms, combined with pressure from an alarmed Democratic base, has put Senate Democrats in a difficult position. Unable to pass legislation to curb the president's power but powerful enough to block funding, they have chosen to force a shutdown by making large, popular demands that Republicans are unlikely to accept.

          <p>Sources familiar with the matter have indicated that the post of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, currently held by Mike Waltz, will not be a Cabinet-level position in the Trump administration. This decision, which has varied between administrations, is seen as a signal of the U.N.'s decreased importance to the current White House. President Trump has been openly critical of the international body, recently questioning its efficacy and slashing U.S. funding. Non-cabinet status means the ambassador will have less direct access to the president and will likely need to run major decisions through the Secretary of State.</p>

          <p>The latest UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts the U.S. economy is heading for a "stagflation-lite" scenario, characterized by modestly elevated inflation and unemployment. The report blames the Trump administration's tariffs and a tightening labor supply for hampering growth, which is expected to be just 1% in the third quarter. While interest rate cuts may provide some relief, economists warn that rising layoffs could lead to a recession. The forecast also notes that political pressure on the Federal Reserve increases the risk of a more severe stagflationary outcome in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing against home equity has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A new $70,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term could now have a monthly payment of around $677, which is marginally lower than it would have been earlier in the year. The article advises homeowners to carefully calculate their ability to repay before borrowing, as failure to do so can result in foreclosure. It also suggests comparing home equity loans with other options like HELOCs to determine the most financially sound choice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an 8% increase in third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by a surge in demand for electric vehicles. Consumers rushed to purchase EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September, leading to record quarterly EV sales for both automakers. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's increased by 30%. The industry-wide sales pace was stronger than expected, though some executives anticipate a slowdown in EV demand in October now that the federal credits have ended.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has temporarily suspended abortion services in response to a new federal law that blocks providers receiving significant Medicaid reimbursements from participating in the program for one year.

By pausing abortions, the affiliate appears to be attempting to remain eligible for Medicaid funding for its other healthcare services.
