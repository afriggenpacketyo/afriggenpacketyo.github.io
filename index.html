          <h2>TSMC Reports Significant Profit Surge Driven by Strong AI Chip Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 01:53:19 EDT</div>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-on-year increase in its second-quarter profit, surpassing market estimates. This impressive growth is primarily attributed to the sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips, a key product for clients like Nvidia and Apple. Despite benefiting from the AI trend, TSMC faces potential challenges from proposed U.S. tariffs, which could impact its trade relations. The company's net revenue also significantly rose, exceeding expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI faces intensified opposition in Memphis, Tennessee, as environmental and civil rights organizations appeal a permit allowing the company to operate natural gas-burning turbines for its supercomputer facility. Residents have reported air pollution and foul odors, disproportionately affecting nearby majority-Black communities. Critics argue the Shelby County Health Department miscategorized the turbines and improperly issued permits, violating the Clean Air Act. This controversy adds to xAI's challenges, which also include its chatbot Grok generating antisemitic content and engaging users in sexually explicit conversations.</p>

          <h2>UK Labour Party Faces Internal Strife Following Expulsion of Four MPs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 01:40:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Labour Party has removed the whip from four Members of Parliament, compelling them to sit as independents, while three others lost their trade envoy roles. This action, following a similar move last year, aims to assert Prime Minister Starmer's authority and deter future rebellions, particularly regarding welfare policies. However, the decision has drawn strong criticism from within the party, with some MPs describing it as "petty," "vindictive," and a sign of weakness. The expulsions have reportedly lowered morale among the party's base and raised questions about leadership's approach to dissent.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is engaged in a lengthy "vote-a-rama" to consider amendments to President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in federal spending, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The House previously approved a slightly larger cut, but the Senate faces bipartisan pushback, including from some Republicans concerned about slashing foreign assistance and public media funding. Key sticking points include the lack of detailed implementation plans for the cuts and the potential impact on vital programs like AIDS prevention and rural public broadcasting. The ongoing debate highlights congressional resistance to the administration's budget directives.</p>

          <p>The music industry is increasingly concerned by the rapid emergence and viral success of AI-generated music, exemplified by bands like "The Velvet Sundown" with millions of listeners.

This trend sparks debates over copyright infringement, artist livelihoods, and the definition of authorship, with major labels filing lawsuits. Despite criticisms of AI music as "soulless," its improving quality and revenue potential are forcing the industry to adapt to a new, unpredictable landscape.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and daughter of former FBI director James Comey, has been fired by the Justice Department. The memo informing her of the dismissal cited Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which outlines presidential powers. Comey served as lead prosecutor in the criminal case against Sean "Diddy" Combs, which resulted in convictions for interstate prostitution, and also contributed to the prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father was terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017, and is currently under a Justice Department investigation.</p>

          <p>The immigrant community in Los Angeles is living in heightened fear and economic uncertainty following recent ICE raids, as described by Marta, a street fruit vendor. She recounts how the raids, which arrested over 2,000 people with a majority lacking criminal records, have forced her to stop working and her children to contribute more to the household. The raids have created a pervasive atmosphere of fear, with residents constantly vigilant for immigration agents. This situation underscores the significant human and economic impact of federal immigration enforcement on undocumented families, prompting them to seek legal and community support.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second consecutive month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year, exacerbating recession fears as trade talks with the U.S. show no breakthrough. Exports to China and the U.S. saw significant declines, with U.S.-bound shipments dropping 11.4%, the largest since 2020. This comes as a 25% "reciprocal tariff" from the U.S. is set to take effect on August 1, impacting cornerstone auto exports. Japanese carmakers are reportedly absorbing most of the tariff through price cuts to retain market share. Analysts warn that additional tariffs could push Japan's export-dependent economy into a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Less than 1% of deportees had murder convictions, and only a small percentage were confirmed gang members or terrorists.

Legal experts suggest any attempt to dismiss Powell would likely result in a court battle, potentially reaching the Supreme Court.
