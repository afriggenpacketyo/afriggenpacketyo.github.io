          <p>President Trump has criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom proposed a federal film tax credit aimed at revitalizing the American film industry. Newsom's proposal came in response to Trump's announcement of potential 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S. Trump argued that Newsom's "gross incompetence" has decimated the film industry, causing it to abandon the U.S. He also touched on the California High-Speed Rail project, criticizing it as a costly overrun. Despite the criticism, Trump expressed a liking for Newsom and acknowledged the January wildfires, claiming he provided water to California.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in Britain is planning to reduce the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 in response to growing concerns about driver shortages and frequent service disruptions.

The average age of UK train drivers is currently 48, with a significant portion nearing retirement by 2029. The initiative aims to alleviate reliance on drivers working overtime and increase diversity within the workforce.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that abandoned coalmines and oil and gas wells are a significant source of methane emissions, exceeding those of Iran and ranking fourth globally if considered a country. Cleaning up these facilities would cost an estimated $100 billion, but funding is challenging due to the lack of economic returns. The report advocates for countries to monitor abandoned facilities, highlighting that satellite monitoring reveals higher emissions than officially reported. While capturing methane from operating facilities is often profitable, action on abandoned sites remains limited, emphasizing the need for mandatory performance measures and global agreements to address methane emissions effectively.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor, critiques President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, arguing that it's based on a flawed diagnosis of America's trade deficits. Rogoff explains that while the dollar's reserve currency status plays a role, it's not the only factor, and the current account deficit is influenced by the balance between national saving and investment. He suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. Rogoff concludes that tariffs are not a cure-all and that the strength of the American economy is a key factor attracting investors.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to support economic growth amid trade tensions. These steps aim to stimulate lending and boost liquidity in key sectors such as technology and real estate. The measures also include establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care, and reducing mortgage rates. However, some analysts suggest these measures may have limited impact on domestic credit demand, noting that borrowing has been somewhat insensitive to interest rates.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing war with Russia, Ukraine's economy has demonstrated impressive resilience, underpinned by effective military resistance and economic management. However, this resilience is built on a fundamental dependence on foreign financial assistance, as Ukraine lacks the resources to meet the war's enormous costs domestically. A recent minerals agreement with the United States, while seen as a victory, underscores this dependency, creating a joint investment fund to access Ukraine's mineral wealth on terms that are advantageous to the US. This deal highlights the challenges Ukraine faces in balancing its sovereignty with the need for external support.</p>
