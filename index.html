        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has intensified his opposition to President Trump's proposed tax-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" and warning it would lead to "debt slavery." Musk is urging citizens to contact their senators and congressmen to advocate against the bill's passage. His criticism comes shortly after his departure from the Trump administration, where he headed the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk's opposition is partly driven by the bill's cuts to an electric vehicle tax credit that benefits Tesla. Optimism is lessened by the public disagreement between high-profile figures and the potential economic implications of the bill. </p>

          <p>The Department of Education is threatening Columbia University's accreditation, alleging the Ivy League institution violated federal anti-discrimination laws. The department claims Columbia leadership showed "deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students" amid protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. The university is accused of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The department requires Columbia's accreditor to establish a compliance plan or take action against the university. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader scrutiny of universities regarding the handling of anti-Semitism allegations. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect charged in the Boulder attack. The judge issued the order to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case, citing the potential for irreparable harm if the family were deported without due process. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had previously announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken Soliman's family into custody for removal proceedings. Soliman, an Egyptian national, faces multiple charges, including attempted murder and a federal hate crimes charge, related to the attack on a pro-Israel hostage event. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move that could increase costs on various consumer goods. Experts predict the tariffs will impact the prices of cars, sports equipment, canned goods, household appliances, and homes. While some domestic steelmakers may benefit, economists warn that businesses will likely pass on the increased costs to consumers.

The EU's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, expressed alarm about the situation, particularly in the automotive sector, during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart. China, which controls approximately 90% of the world's rare earth supply, imposed export controls in April, requiring licenses for the export of several rare earth elements and magnets.

          <p>Despite efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy, the European Union has increased its imports of Russian fertilizer since the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's share of EU fertilizer imports has risen to approximately 30%, prompting the European Parliament to endorse tariffs on fertilizers from Russia and Belarus. The EU aims to gradually increase these tariffs to 50% by 2028 to encourage diversification of supply and promote the use of organic fertilizers. However, farmers' groups are urging the EU to develop affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer to avoid undermining the economic viability of farms and food security. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is proposing an innovative solution to address President Trump's efforts to undermine civil service protections. Trump has effectively neutralized federal agencies responsible for safeguarding civil servants from political firings by firing key officials. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit argues that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the special counsel are unable to fulfill their roles due to these firings, the courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected. </p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's tariffs could reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade if they remain in place. However, the forecast includes several caveats, including uncertainty about the impact of tariffs on imports and the possibility of legal challenges. While the tariffs are expected to cut deficits, they are also projected to result in higher inflation and slower economic growth. Forecasters say tariffs will likely raise prices for both rich families and poor families, although the CBO is still sorting out which end of the income ladder would be hit hardest.

          <p>LGBTQ+ leaders and elected officials are condemning the Trump administration's plan to remove Harvey Milk's name from a US naval ship, particularly during Pride month. Milk, a former city supervisor and gay rights advocate, is a revered figure in San Francisco. Critics view the renaming as an attempt to erase the contributions of LGBTQ+ people and an insult to American values. The USNS Harvey Milk was named in 2016 after leaders who fought for civil and human rights. </p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Senate Republicans to garner support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which advances his legislative agenda. The bill faces opposition from some Republicans concerned about its impact on the national debt. The House-passed legislation also boosts spending for the military and border security, while making some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs. Elon Musk's criticism of the bill has provided political cover for Senate Republicans who have concerns. </p>
