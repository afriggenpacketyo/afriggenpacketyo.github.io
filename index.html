          <p>This article discusses how voters in countries allied with the United States are favoring stability over disruption, particularly in light of the unpredictable policies and behavior of figures like Elon Musk and Peter Navarro. The article contrasts Musk's slash-and-burn approach to government efficiency with Navarro's foreign trade policies, highlighting the concerns of shell-shocked voters who are wary of further upheaval. The analysis suggests a preference for a more predictable and reliable international environment among these nations, especially considering recent global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will be holding a press conference to announce a major trade deal with a 'big, and highly respected, country,' speculated to be the United Kingdom. This announcement comes after Trump imposed tariffs on dozens of trading partners, before announcing a 90-day pause on the levies, prompting nations to scramble for deals with Washington. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but it could involve lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products in exchange for lower British taxes on US technology companies.</p>

          <p>Following weeks of escalating tensions and a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes against Pakistan, leading both sides to claim victory. India asserted that its actions were limited and targeted, while Pakistan focused on its success in downing Indian aircraft. Diplomats and analysts express hope that these events might provide an offramp to avert a full-scale war, fueled by back-channel conversations between national security advisors. The nature of the strikes could help quell public anger in India, while Pakistan aims to demonstrate strength without risking further economic hardship.</p>
