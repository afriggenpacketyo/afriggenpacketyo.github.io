          <p>Catastrophic flooding in Texas has resulted in at least 70 fatalities, prompting President Trump to sign a major disaster declaration for Kerr County. The declaration activates the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide resources for first responders and recovery efforts. The U.S. Coast Guard is assisting in ongoing search-and-rescue operations, particularly for 11 campers and a counselor still missing from a summer camp on the Guadalupe River. Officials are continuing to assess the widespread damage as search efforts persist for the missing.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS group of developing nations met in Rio de Janeiro, with Brazilian President Lula da Silva criticizing the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism." The summit was notable for the absence of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who participated via videoconference to avoid potential arrest under an ICC warrant. In his remarks, Putin claimed the model of liberal globalization is becoming obsolete and urged greater cooperation among member states. The bloc aims to update international governance to reflect a new multipolar reality.</p>

          <h2>Wimbledon Match Disrupted as Electronic Line-Calling System Fails</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 13:48:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was halted after the electronic line-calling system failed to make a call on a crucial point. A clear out-ball from Kartal was not called, and the chair umpire, unable to verify the system's status, ordered the point to be replayed, which Kartal then won. Pavlyuchenkova expressed significant frustration, stating a game was "stolen" from her, and criticized the umpire for not making the call manually. Despite the controversy, Pavlyuchenkova ultimately won the match, but the incident has raised questions about the reliability of the new automated system.</p>

          <p>The economic consequences of President Trump's newly signed tax and spending bill are a point of sharp contention between the White House and Democrats. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the bill, asserting it will spur 3% growth and ultimately shrink the deficit, dismissing outside analyses as flawed. In contrast, Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi labeled it the "big, ugly bill," arguing it will dangerously increase the deficit, fuel inflation, and strip healthcare from millions. The debate also covers the law's work requirements for Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a public fissure with President Trump over a major tax and spending bill, Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political entity called the "America Party." Musk, who once led a government efficiency initiative for the administration, heavily criticized the legislation as an "insane spending bill" that would increase the national debt. He positioned the new party as a response to what he calls a "one-party system" on government spending, aiming to give voters more freedom. The move signals a significant political shift for the billionaire, whose financial backing could impact future elections.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's major tax and spending bill was a testament to "congressional clock management," involving weeks of protracted negotiations and procedural maneuvers. The legislative process was marked by multiple delays, a nearly 16-hour reading of the 940-page bill, and an all-night "vote-a-rama" in the Senate. In the House, a record-breaking seven-and-a-half-hour vote on a technical correction preceded a marathon speech by the Minority Leader to stall the final vote. The bill ultimately passed just before the July 4th holiday, showcasing the intense political wrangling required to secure the legislative victory.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which killed nearly 70 people, underscore the growing difficulty of forecasting extreme weather events exacerbated by the climate crisis. An analysis shows the rainfall was a 1-in-500-year event, with an intensity that was difficult to predict precisely, even for a region known as "flash flood alley." Despite the National Weather Service issuing timely watches and warnings, including a top-level flash flood emergency, the sheer volume of rain far exceeded initial forecasts. The disaster highlights how current forecasting technology struggles to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of such unprecedented downpours.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of vandalism after portraits in the Windrush Untold Stories exhibition in Brixton were damaged. The Metropolitan Police have stated that they do not believe the incident was a hate crime, a clarification intended to reassure the community. The outdoor art installation, located in Windrush Square, features portraits and firsthand accounts of those who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean. Organizers had previously described the vandalism as an attack driven by racial hatred, which caused considerable distress to local residents.</p>

          <p>Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has condemned efforts by the White House to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, calling the move "foolhardy and misguided." In a recent interview, Burns argued that defunding public media entities like PBS is shortsighted, as they provide essential services, particularly in rural areas where they may be the only available signal. He stressed that he could not have produced his acclaimed historical films without the support and long-term incubation period that PBS provides. The filmmaker likened PBS to an essential American institution.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are in a critical week of negotiations to secure a trade deal with Washington and avert President Trump's threatened tariffs of up to 50% on EU imports. With a July 9 deadline approaching, the EU is aiming for a framework agreement similar to the one the UK secured, as a comprehensive deal appears unattainable. There is a split among member states, with some, like Germany, favoring a quick deal to avoid a trade war, while others, like France, are wary of an imbalanced agreement. The uncertainty has already impacted the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a harrowing first-person account, an NPR journalist in Gaza describes the life-threatening ordeal of obtaining food from a distribution site supported by the U.S. and Israel. The journey involved dodging Israeli military fire, facing armed private contractors, and fighting through desperate crowds, only to be robbed by thieves. The journalist details the widespread hunger and lawlessness that have taken hold, forcing people to risk their lives for basic rations at sites the UN has called a "death trap." The report paints a grim picture of societal collapse, where the daily quest for food results in hundreds of casualties.</p>

          <p>A former administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) claims that deep staffing cuts under the Trump administration have compromised the United States' ability to predict extreme weather. Rick Spinrad, the former chief, stated that many weather forecast offices are now understaffed, putting an extra burden on the remaining scientists and degrading the quality of forecasts. While he did not directly link the cuts to the recent Texas flooding disaster, he warned that without adequate research and staff, predictions for all severe weather events will inevitably be less reliable, compromising public safety.</p>

          <p>A 3,500-year-old city named Peñico has been discovered by archaeologists in Peru's northern Barranca province. Researchers believe the city, which features ceremonial temples and residential complexes, served as a vital trading hub connecting coastal communities with those in the Andes and Amazon. The discovery is significant for shedding light on the societal developments that followed the decline of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization. The site's strategic location and the artifacts found, including clay sculptures and shell necklaces, point to its role as a center of exchange and cultural continuation.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the ongoing war in Gaza and the international community's response are causing the collapse of the post-WWII "rules-based international order." It posits that by allowing Israel to bomb hospitals, use starvation as a weapon, and disregard international law with impunity, powerful Western nations are eroding the very legal and political foundations they claim to uphold. The piece connects this global shift to domestic issues, such as the repression of pro-Palestinian dissent on university campuses, suggesting a broader militarization of liberal societies against their own citizens. The author warns that this hypocrisy threatens global stability.</p>

          <p>A communication expert and executive coach warns that certain common phrases can make a person sound judgmental, even unintentionally, and erode trust in relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can be perceived as condescending or dismissive, while prefacing statements with "To be honest..." can imply prior dishonesty. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" instead of offering an immediate solution. By focusing on helpfulness and humility, individuals can improve their communication.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly ramping up its influence in the Western Balkans, using a strategy some experts call "infrastructure imperialism." This soft power projection involves funding major projects like the Namazgah mosque in Albania's capital, which is part of a broader geopolitical push that includes economic and military cooperation. Turkish investors and construction companies, often with ties to President Erdogan, are involved in large-scale developments across the region. This policy is seen as part of Turkey's effort to assert itself as a regional power, using historical and cultural ties to advance its modern geopolitical goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has suggested that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches. Arguing for a "polluter pays" approach, the commissioner questioned why organizers of large, profitable events do not pay for the police resources required to secure them. The comments were made as part of a broader call for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger ones to better manage overstretched funding. This proposal aims to make better use of police funds.</p>
