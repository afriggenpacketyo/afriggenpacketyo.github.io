          <p>The son of an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for five months fears they could die in prison due to their rapidly declining health. Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 76, were arrested in February despite facing no charges, and have been held in harsh conditions, including a maximum-security prison. The son reports his father is suffering from serious convulsions and his mother is numb from anemia, while the UN has called for their immediate medical care, labeling their detention as "inhumane." The family continues to wait for their release, which Taliban officials had previously promised would happen soon.</p>

          <p>Shares for major European automobile manufacturers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, rose significantly following a new trade agreement between the United States and Japan. The deal, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 15%, has sparked optimism that a similar breakthrough could be reached for the European Union. This development comes as the EU has been actively seeking to lower U.S. auto tariffs, facing a potential increase to 30% if no agreement is made. The positive market reaction reflects hopes that the U.S.-Japan deal may set a precedent for future negotiations with other major auto exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Economists Argue China Needs Systemic Reform, Not Just Short-Term Stimulus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:54:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid growing deflationary pressures, economists from prominent Chinese institutions are advising that the country's economy requires fundamental institutional reforms rather than just short-term stimulus measures. They argue that boosting "total factor productivity" through innovation and systemic changes is crucial for long-term growth as China formulates its upcoming "15th five-year plan." This includes altering the incentive structure for local officials, who are currently driven to prioritize production-based revenue, contributing to industrial overcapacity. While some stimulus might be needed, the focus is shifting toward sustainable, high-quality development and addressing deep-seated economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the tariff reduction, which is a crucial development for Japan's economy, as auto exports are a major component of its trade with the U.S. The deal has been seen as a potential political victory for Ishiba amidst domestic pressures.

          <p>A new report from AI firm Anthropic highlights a significant disparity in power capacity between China and the United States, which could impact the global AI race. Last year, China added approximately 400 gigawatts of power capacity, about ten times more than the U.S. This is particularly concerning as the American AI sector alone is projected to require at least 50 gigawatts by 2028. The report suggests that this energy infrastructure gap gives China a considerable advantage in developing and scaling energy-intensive AI technologies, posing a challenge to U.S. competitiveness in this critical field.</p>

The legislation has also drawn concern from Western allies, including the European Union, which has made anti-corruption efforts a key condition for financial aid and Ukraine's potential EU membership.

The sustained low inflation could allow the MAS to ease its monetary policy to support economic growth amid an uncertain global trade environment. Despite strong GDP growth in the first half of the year, the MAS has expressed concerns about a subdued outlook due to softening global demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile are raising concerns about "overtourism," pointing to the proliferation of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous thoroughfare. Long-time locals describe how the area has transformed from a normal neighborhood with essential services into a district that primarily caters to the five million tourists who visit annually. This shift has led to a decline in the local school's population and forces residents to travel elsewhere for basic needs. While tourism supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, critics argue that the concentration of similar shops signals the broader challenges of mass tourism on community life.</p>

          <p>Despite a tough UK retail environment, a chain of stores called Duck World, which sells only themed rubber ducks, continues to operate in prime London locations. The business, which caters to tourists, collectors, and gift-seekers, has faced pressures from inflation and rising costs but stays afloat due to the iconic appeal of its products and a loyal customer base. Retail analysts suggest the niche "treatonomics" trend and high profit margins on collectibles contribute to its survival. The founders acknowledge the challenges but remain optimistic, denying rumors of illicit activities and asserting their legitimacy as a quirky but profitable business.</p>

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit in Beijing is set against a backdrop of escalating tensions over trade, technology, and security, with low expectations for major breakthroughs. The relationship is further complicated by U.S. trade policies, as both blocs navigate their respective issues with Washington. Analysts suggest that while there's a mutual interest in countering some U.S. unilateralism, deep-seated differences will likely limit cooperation. The EU's stance in its own trade negotiations with the U.S. could influence its relationship with China, making the summit a delicate balancing act for European leaders.</p>

          <p>Major luxury and fashion brands like LVMH, Celine, and Giorgio Armani are increasingly integrating cafes and dining spaces into their retail stores across China. This strategy aims to create a more immersive "lifestyle" experience, encouraging shoppers to spend more time and money in their establishments. In a challenging consumer market, this tactic is seen as a cost-efficient way to attract foot traffic and build brand loyalty compared to expensive celebrity endorsements. The high margins on coffee and food items also provide an additional revenue stream for these international companies seeking to engage with Chinese consumers.</p>

          <p>Scientists have analyzed teeth marks on the fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird," a large, flightless predator that lived 13 million years ago, and concluded it was likely attacked by an even larger reptile. The puncture marks on the bone, discovered in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, were matched to an extinct caiman species called Purussaurus neivensis, which could grow up to five meters long. Since the bone shows no signs of healing, researchers believe the attack was fatal. This discovery provides rare evidence of an interaction between two apex predators and suggests the fearsome terror birds were more vulnerable than previously thought.</p>

The judges had acted because Habba's 120-day interim term was expiring without her having been confirmed by the Senate.
