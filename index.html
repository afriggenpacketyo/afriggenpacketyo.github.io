        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aston Villa is lodging a formal complaint with the Premier League following a controversial refereeing decision during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United, a loss that cost them a Champions League spot. The incident in question involved a disallowed goal by Morgan Rogers, where the referee prematurely blew his whistle, preventing VAR intervention. Villa's director of football operations expressed discontent over the selection of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial match, emphasizing the mistake wasn't about the referee's decision itself, but the selection process. The Professional Game Match Officials Limited declined to comment on the situation, leaving Villa to express their frustration through official channels. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>German authorities have revealed that the suspect in a recent knife attack at Hamburg's central train station, which injured 18 people, had a known history of mental illness. The 39-year-old German national, who admitted to the act, had been in psychiatric care for three weeks prior to the incident and was released just a day before the stabbing. Police initiated criminal proceedings against her last year after she showed signs of mental illness at police stations. The suspect now faces charges of attempted manslaughter combined with grievous bodily harm, as the investigation seeks to understand the circumstances surrounding her release and the attack.

          <p>Russia conducted one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across the country. Ukrainian officials stated that the attack demonstrated Moscow's lack of interest in a truce, despite ongoing diplomatic efforts. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down about two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones, but the attacks have overwhelmed air defenses, particularly in western and southern regions. The violence has intensified since February, with civilian deaths rising each month, and Ukrainian President Zelensky has called for increased pressure on Russia. The optimism score is 10.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, arguing they have a "moral component" because able-bodied individuals who refuse to work are "defrauding the system." Johnson claims the bill does not cut Medicaid but targets fraud, waste, and abuse, although an analysis suggests 190,000 people in Louisiana could lose coverage. He stated that the requirements are not burdensome, requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week or participate in job training or volunteering. However, GOP senators like Josh Hawley have criticized the bill, calling it morally wrong and politically suicidal to slash Medicaid, creating potential opposition in the Senate.

          <p>U.S. federal judges are considering forming their own armed security force due to increasing concerns about the Trump administration's protection of the judiciary. The proposal emerged at a meeting where judges expressed fears that the Justice Department, under Trump's influence, might withdraw security from judges who rule against him. This move would shift control of the U.S. Marshals Service from the Attorney General to the Chief Justice, ensuring judicial independence in security matters.

          <p>A New York Times guest essay argues that the Supreme Court is increasingly enabling President Trump to consolidate power, citing a recent unsigned order that blessed some of his firings of high-level officials. The author contends that the court's decision effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, granting the president considerable new authority. The essay suggests that the Supreme Court's decisions, including those on presidential immunity, have emboldened the president to act outside traditional constitutional order. The author expresses concern that the court is undermining lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law and enabling an administration eager to trample it. The optimism score is 30.</p>

Ron Johnson stated that he believes there are enough senators to stall the bill unless there are deeper spending cuts to reduce the deficit. The bill, which passed the House by a narrow margin, also faces opposition due to its increase in the debt ceiling and proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.

          <p>The head of the U.N. World Food Program, Cindy McCain, has stated that the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is a "drop in the bucket" compared to what is needed to prevent famine. She warned that 500,000 people in Gaza are extremely food insecure and on the verge of famine due to the Israeli blockade. McCain pushed back on claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, attributing it to the desperation of starving people. She called for the international community to increase pressure to allow more aid to enter Gaza at scale. The optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Georgia has resigned after erroneously arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and facing deportation. The officer, Leslie O’Neal, arrested college student Ximena Arias-Cristobal for a traffic violation that was later dropped, but not before she was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Arias-Cristobal's arrest has garnered national attention, with many advocating for her release and criticizing Ice and the local police department. The case highlights the impact of 287(g) contracts and recent state laws requiring local law enforcement to collaborate with Ice, which immigration advocacy organizations have denounced as disastrous.

          <p>Despite a pledge to halt public funding for fossil fuels at the G7 summit in 2022, Japan remains a leading public financier of gas and oil projects. Japanese public financial institutions provided $93 billion in investments for oil and gas projects from 2013 to 2024, with $56 billion going towards overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development projects. Japan's investment in LNG is part of a strategy to secure energy supplies and resell surplus LNG, but critics argue that it undermines global climate goals. Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" is seen as greenwashing, as studies show that LNG involves more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered.

          <p>After studying over 200 kids, one expert suggests that emotionally safe parenting, which focuses on attunement to a child's emotional needs, is the most effective parenting style. The goal is to build emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. It involves accepting emotions without rushing to fix them, responding without shaming, viewing behavior as a signal rather than defiance, and taking responsibility after conflicts. The style also emphasizes the importance of the parent doing their own inner work to become less reactive and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves.

          <p>Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, is calling on voters to participate in legislative and gubernatorial elections, a year after a falsified presidential election. Independent observers are not present, and many believe the results will be manufactured. The vote has reopened a rift among opposition activists, with some calling for abstention and others for participation as a form of protest. The government has lifted bans on political participation for some opposition activists while detaining others. The Trump administration's approach to Venezuela and the migrant crisis has also created division. The optimism score is 30.</p>
