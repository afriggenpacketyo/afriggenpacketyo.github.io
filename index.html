          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% in the third quarter, meeting analyst forecasts, despite a deepening real estate slump that saw property investment slide 13.9% year-on-year through September. Fixed-asset investment also unexpectedly fell, reflecting broader slowdowns in infrastructure and manufacturing. However, industrial production climbed 6.5%, exceeding expectations, and retail sales rose 3%. The core consumer price index increased at its fastest pace in months, yet headline inflation dropped, indicating persistent deflationary pressures. This article highlights the ongoing challenges and varied performance within China's economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands participated in "No Kings" protests across the U.S. and globally, expressing anger over President Trump's policies, including crackdowns on undocumented migrants and deployment of National Guard troops. Demonstrators, carrying signs like "Resist Fascism," gathered in major cities such as New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., with events often resembling street parties featuring marching bands and creative displays. While Republicans disparaged them as "Hate America" rallies, organizers asserted a deep love for the country and a commitment to fighting for its democratic principles. Tensions flared in Portland, Oregon, where federal agents deployed tear gas amid clashes between protesters and counter-protesters.</p>

          <p>A Boeing 747 cargo aircraft, wet-leased from ACT Airlines and operating for Emirates SkyCargo, veered off the north runway and ditched into the sea while landing at Hong Kong International Airport. This tragic incident, occurring early Monday, led to the confirmed deaths of two airport ground staff who were affected and fell into the water. Four crew members aboard the freighter were successfully rescued and transported to a hospital, where their safety was confirmed. The northern runway was closed as a result, prompting an immediate investigation by Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department into the circumstances of the crash.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reacted to the global "No Kings Day" protests, publicly dismissing them as "a joke" and asserting that the participants were "not representative of this country." Speaking to reporters, Trump emphatically denied being a king, stating, "I work my ass off to make our country great." He also suggested that the demonstrations were orchestrated and funded by "Soros and other radical left lunatics." This article highlights the President's confrontational stance against the widespread rallies that took place in major cities, where protestors voiced opposition to his administration's policies and perceived authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military carried out its seventh strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel in the past month, resulting in the deaths of three individuals, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed. The targeted boat, linked to the Colombian guerrilla group Ejército de Liberación Nacional, was reportedly transporting substantial amounts of narcotics in international waters. Hegseth asserted that the U.S. is engaged in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, justifying these actions as responses to an "armed attack" on the U.S. However, this article highlights growing pushback from lawmakers who question the legal justification and demand more evidence for these lethal operations.</p>

Sources suggest Trump's position was influenced by a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who allegedly proposed a specific territorial swap.
