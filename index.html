        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential move an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about the plan and suggested President Trump's motives extend beyond crime reduction, possibly aiming to influence future elections. The White House dismissed the governor's accusations, criticizing the city's crime rate. This follows similar controversial federal deployments in other major U.S. cities, which have raised legal questions about presidential authority over state National Guard forces.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B testified in a Los Angeles civil trial, denying accusations that she assaulted a security guard in 2018. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, claims the rapper spat on her and cut her cheek with a fingernail, while Cardi B maintains the encounter was a verbal dispute over privacy during her pregnancy. Various moments from her testimony have gone viral, including witty exchanges with the opposing attorney about her pregnancy, wigs, and fingernails. The high-profile nature of the case highlights the growing influence of social media in public perception of celebrity legal battles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House announced President Trump has canceled $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that was previously approved by Congress, affecting 15 international programs. The administration utilized a rarely used "pocket rescission" procedure, which allows the president to withhold funds near the end of the fiscal year when lawmakers lack the time to act. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have criticized the move, with Senator Susan Collins calling it a violation of the law. The decision is expected to significantly impact USAID and UN peacekeeping missions, and Democrats warn it could increase the risk of a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old woman in Maine was arrested after allegedly trying to run over U.S. Border Patrol agents with her vehicle. The incident occurred while the agents were assisting state and local police with the arrest of two undocumented immigrants following a traffic accident. Authorities stated the woman, Olivia Wilkins, began verbally abusing officers before driving her car at them, swerving and squealing her tires. The Department of Homeland Security linked the event to a broader trend of increased assaults against immigration law enforcement, attributing it to heated political rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A charity program in London and Manchester is helping anxious and disengaged teenagers improve their school attendance by pairing them with toddlers as mentors. The initiative, run by the charity Power2, aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the teens. Participants report significant improvements in their self-esteem and school engagement, with one student's attendance more than doubling.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. has ruled that many of President Trump's tariff policies were an overstep of his presidential powers. The 7-4 decision found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law the administration cited, does not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs. The ruling specifically voids the 10% baseline tariffs and "reciprocal" tariffs, stating they are "unbounded in scope, amount and duration." The decision is a major legal blow to the administration's trade policies and will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

This change follows new FDA approvals that are more restrictive than previous emergency authorizations, limiting the vaccine to seniors and younger individuals with specific health conditions. Due to varying state laws, CVS cannot administer the vaccine even with a prescription in states like Massachusetts and Nevada.

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine indicates that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too soon after their diagnosis, contrary to clinical guidelines. The research, which analyzed nearly 10,000 health records, found that 42% of diagnosed children aged 3 to 5 were prescribed drugs within 30 days. Experts recommend behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment for this age group due to potential side effects from stimulants like Ritalin, such as irritability and emotional problems. The study highlights a need to investigate why medication is often used before other strategies are attempted.</p>

The goal is to create a map that favors Republicans and could help the party capture an additional U.S. House seat currently held by a Democrat in the Kansas City area. This move is part of a broader national trend where both parties are pursuing mid-decade redistricting to gain a partisan edge ahead of the midterm elections.

The strategy is a high-stakes gamble that could either secure the GOP's hold on the state or backfire if Latino voters shift back toward Democrats.</p>

          <p>Following a third-round loss to Elena Rybakina at the US Open, British tennis player Emma Raducanu suggested that the world's top players seem to have a "point to prove" when they face her. Her four defeats at major tournaments this year have all come against elite opponents, including Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka. Raducanu acknowledged that while she is improving, the top tier has consistently raised their game against her. She plans to continue working with her new coach, Francisco Roig, focusing on improving her serve and readiness for fast returns to close the gap with the sport's best.</p>

          <p>Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to Republican inaction in the legislature. Kenyatta argues that the funding crisis, which is already impacting thousands of commuters, is unnecessary as bipartisan funding proposals exist. He frames his march as part of a "time-honoured American tradition" of protest to highlight the disparate priorities between the political parties.</p>

          <p>A San Bernardino man, Francisco Longoria, has been arrested by federal authorities and charged with assaulting immigration officers, weeks after an incident where a CBP officer shot at his truck. Longoria's attorneys state he was stopped for an "immigration check" and drove away in fear after masked officers shattered his window. While DHS claims Longoria tried to run officers down, his lawyers have released video that appears to contradict this. His attorneys decry the pre-dawn arrest involving an armored vehicle as an intimidation tactic intended to punish him for speaking out about the initial encounter.</p>

The attack occurred during a school mass when a 23-year-old former student, Robin Westman, fired into the church from outside before taking their own life. In a statement, Harper's parents urged leaders to address gun violence and the mental health crisis. The shooting, which also injured 17 others, has renewed calls for stricter gun control measures, with the city's mayor highlighting the need to regulate assault-style weapons.</p>

          <p>The prospects for an American men's singles champion at the US Open suffered a major blow on Friday with the exits of Ben Shelton and Frances Tiafoe. The 6th-seeded Shelton was forced to retire from his third-round match with a shoulder injury while leading, marking the first retirement of his career. Shortly after, 17th-seeded Tiafoe, a two-time semifinalist in New York, was upset in straight sets by German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff. The dual losses leave only Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul remaining in the draw, extending the nation's 22-year drought in men's Grand Slam singles titles.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit panel unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the administration likely acted unlawfully. The judges argued that the TPS statute, as written by Congress, does not permit the Homeland Security Secretary to unilaterally vacate a prior extension of the status. This ruling provides temporary relief for TPS holders who faced the possibility of losing their permission to live and work in the country.</p>

The deal forms a new entity designed to accumulate large amounts of Crypto.com's proprietary token, Cronos. This move is the latest in a series of pro-crypto actions by the administration, which has pursued deregulation and praised the industry, a stance that has coincided with the president's own financial interests in memecoins.

The decisions follow pressure from the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which raised national security concerns and alleged the program is a state-managed technology transfer effort supporting China's military. The move comes paradoxically as President Trump has publicly stated that the U.S. would welcome more students from China, highlighting a conflict between administration rhetoric and congressional pressure on academic institutions.</p>

The case, brought by a coalition of U.S. solar companies, alleges that producers in these countries, many with Chinese ownership, are unfairly subsidized and selling products below cost. This procedural step could lead to the imposition of tariffs on these imports.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing accusations of "political lawfare" for threatening felony mortgage fraud charges against prominent Democrats, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York AG Letitia James. The allegations center on whether they falsely listed properties as primary residences on loan applications, a common but rarely prosecuted offense. Critics argue this is a selective and politically motivated use of prosecutorial power, especially given that President Trump himself was found liable for inflating his assets to secure loans. The actions raise concerns about the weaponization of the justice system for political revenge.</p>
