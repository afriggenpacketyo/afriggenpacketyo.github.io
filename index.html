          <p>Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, stated that while their Ascend chips lag behind U.S. chips by a generation, comparable performance can be achieved through techniques like stacking and clustering. In an interview with People's Daily, Ren highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. He noted the strength of China's power grid and communication networks, emphasizing the potential of open-source software to meet societal needs. This comes amid increasing U.S. restrictions on China and Huawei, with the U.S. Department of Commerce potentially interpreting the use of Ascend chips as a violation of export controls. Optimism regarding Huawei's ability to overcome technological barriers is tempered by ongoing geopolitical tensions. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated rice prices, according to farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move will leave the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. The released rice will be directed towards smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, averaging 4,260 yen ($29) per 5 kilograms in late May, prompting the government to take action to lower overall prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>A mural by Barbara Kruger titled "Questions" has become a prominent backdrop to protests in downtown Los Angeles, featuring stark white letters on a red background posing questions about power and control. The mural, commissioned in 1990, includes queries such as "Who is beyond the law?" and "Who follows orders?" Kruger commented that the situation is giving Trump what he wants: the moment he can declare martial law. During the protests, the Museum of Contemporary Art closed early for safety, and misinformation spread on social media, with false claims of damage to the museum. Nadya Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot continued her durational performance, broadcasting live audio of the protests mixed with her heartbeat to the empty museum. </p>

However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C criticized the lack of transparency regarding the project's total cost and the potential impact on consumer bills.

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is suing Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for federalizing the initial troops. Newsom argued that the deployment is unnecessary and disrespectful to the troops. The Defense Department has also mobilized Marines to support the Guard troops. Trump has stated he would support arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions. The ACLU condemned Trump's mobilization of the Marines, questioning their training for policing protests. </p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world," citing "fundamental flaws" and outdated gender stereotypes. A report by the Women and Equalities Committee calls for bold action and significant investment to improve the system. Statutory paternity leave allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, receiving £187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower, which is considered inadequate. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks. The findings coincide with a planned "dad strike" to protest current parental leave policies. </p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite marking and write letters to parents, aiming to free up time for face-to-face teaching. The Department for Education (DfE) advises teachers to be transparent about AI usage and to verify its results. AI should only be used for low-stakes marking, such as quizzes or homework, and teachers must check its outputs. Teachers are also permitted to use AI to draft routine letters to parents. Experts emphasize the importance of teachers learning to use AI effectively, while also acknowledging potential risks such as data breaches and errors. </p>

Satellite images reveal structural damage to the ship's superstructure, with mangled metal and bent lines. Some areas of the ship were flooded with seawater, potentially affecting machinery and electronics. The vessel was refloated and turned upright around June 3rd, and the 50-mile voyage to the dry dock suggests the hull is intact. The repairs pose a significant challenge for North Korea, and potential assistance from China or Russia remains a possibility. </p>

About 3.5 million tonnes of sludge are spread annually as cheap fertilizer, but it can be contaminated with cancer-linked chemicals, microplastics, and industrial pollutants. The EA has been aware of the issue since 2017, particularly regarding "forever chemicals" or PFAS. The water industry is increasingly concerned that farmers might stop accepting the sludge and is lobbying regulators. The government says regulations around sludge spreading are being reviewed. </p>
