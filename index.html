          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is being implemented in nursing homes and hospitals to reduce the use of elderspeak, a form of communication that resembles baby talk and is often directed towards older adults. The program, which includes videos and interactive sessions, aims to educate caregivers on the negative impacts of elderspeak, such as increased resistance to care and reduced autonomy. Studies have shown that CHAT training can significantly decrease the use of elderspeak and improve communication, leading to better outcomes for older adults, while also lowering the use of antipsychotic drugs.</p>

This bipartisan cooperation has drawn criticism from within the Republican Party, with the state party even censuring the nine senators.

          <p>Pakistan conducted a test launch of a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a range of 450 kilometers, escalating tensions with India following a deadly attack on tourists in the disputed Kashmir region. The Pakistani military stated that the launch aimed to ensure operational readiness and validate key technical parameters of the missile system. This action occurs amid heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations, with both sides accusing the other of instigating violence in the contested region.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions following a deadly attack in Kashmir, India has banned imports from Pakistan, citing national security concerns. Pakistan has responded by test-firing a ballistic missile. India has also suspended the Indus Water Treaty, which governs water sharing between the two countries. While India blames Pakistan for backing the attackers, Islamabad denies responsibility. Both countries have closed the Wagah Attari border and expelled diplomats, raising fears of further conflict in the disputed Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has launched legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The NAHT is seeking a judicial review of the new school report cards, which are set to replace the current one or two-word judgments. The union argues that the new system is simply 'another crude grading system' that will negatively impact school leaders, while Ofsted maintains that the changes are necessary and support mental health. The legal challenge follows calls for a delay in implementing the new system after the suicide of head teacher Ruth Perry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 25 percent tariff on key auto parts, including engines, impacting Japan's car industry, which already faces the same tariff on automobiles. To mitigate the impact, the administration is assisting manufacturers in relocating supply chains for car parts used in the United States over the next two years. Japan's auto industry, a key driver of its economy, exported approximately 6 trillion yen worth of vehicles to the U.S. last year, with auto parts accounting for a significant portion of total exports.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, injured nearly 50 people, including an 11-year-old child, as the drones targeted civilian infrastructure and residential buildings. The attack occurred shortly before Russia's planned three-day ceasefire for its World War II holiday, which Ukraine views as insincere. President Zelenskyy has called for increased international pressure on Russia, emphasizing the need for effective sanctions to force a ceasefire and end the ongoing war. The attack follows another recent incident in Zaporizhzhia, where 29 people were injured, underscoring the continued intensity of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, reported that the plane lost altitude and was forced to land near the Itanomas River in Bolivia. The survivors, including three women, a child, and the pilot, stood on top of the plane, surrounded by alligators. They were eventually rescued by local fishermen and transported to a hospital, having survived by eating cassava flour one of the passengers had brought and believing that petrol leaking from the plane kept the predators at bay.</p>

          <p>Analysts express skepticism about Ukraine's near-term capacity to rival China as a major supplier of critical minerals for the U.S., despite a recent minerals deal with Washington. The majority of Ukraine's mineral deposits are located in Russian-occupied territories, and extracting and processing the remaining resources will take years due to limited infrastructure. China's dominance in rare earth element reserves and processing capabilities far exceeds Ukraine's current potential, suggesting that American companies will continue to rely on Chinese sources for the foreseeable future.</p>

The report, an official impact assessment, analyzes the potential costs and savings associated with legalizing assisted dying. The assessment indicates that the NHS could save millions in hospital and care costs, but implementing and staffing an assisted dying service would also incur significant expenses. The government remains neutral on the issue, while proponents emphasize compassion and choice, and opponents express concerns about vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Europe is grappling with its reliance on US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard, prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to explore alternatives for digital payments. The concern stems from potential vulnerabilities and the desire for greater strategic autonomy. While some experts argue that the dependency is overstated, the ECB is pushing for a 'digital euro' and promoting initiatives like Wero to reduce reliance on foreign-owned payment systems. Russia's experience after Visa and Mastercard ceased operations in 2022 provides a case study for maintaining domestic payment systems.</p>
