          <p>Ward Sakeik, a stateless woman who has lived in the U.S. since childhood, was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection upon returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Despite having an "order of supervision" that allowed her to stay and work in the U.S., she now faces deportation. Her husband, Taahir Shaikh, is concerned about her uncertain future and the lack of due process. The Department of Homeland Security claims she is in the U.S. illegally and has exhausted her legal options, though her lawyer argues otherwise. The optimism score reflects the distressing circumstances and the potential for a negative outcome. </p>

The RNC reported $72 million on hand at the end of May, compared to the DNC's $15 million. This fundraising disparity highlights internal tensions within the Democratic party following President Donald Trump's return to the White House. While the DNC points to a surge in grassroots support and record individual donations since February, some Democrats express concern about the party's direction and vision (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is publicly disagreeing with his own intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear weapons program. Gabbard testified that the intelligence community assesses that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Trump, however, claims that Gabbard and the intelligence community are wrong, potentially signaling a justification for a possible attack against Iran. Senator Jack Reed suggests that Trump's stance is politically motivated and aimed at supporting a potential military action against Iran.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of State has initiated assisted departure flights from Israel, according to U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. This action follows confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for American citizens evacuating from Israel. The State Department has placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there due to ongoing conflict and unrest. Several commercial airlines have suspended flights from Israel to the United States, prompting alternative evacuation measures, including charter flights and land crossings into Jordan.</p>
