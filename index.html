          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income surpassed analyst estimates, though it showed an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders, classifying the financial unit as a discontinued operation starting this quarter. The company's outlook for the financial year ending in March 2026 was conservative, projecting a slight increase in operating profit, partially offset by the impact of U.S. tariffs, though this may be affected by the recent U.S.-China trade deal.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused members of Congress of committing felonies during an altercation at a Newark immigration detention center. She claimed the lawmakers assaulted law enforcement officers while attempting an "oversight visit," calling their actions criminal and hypocritical. U.S. Reps. Rob Menendez Jr., Bonnie Watson Coleman, and LaMonica McIver, all New Jersey Democrats, allegedly stormed the facility's gate, prompting criticism from DHS, which stated the lawmakers put agents and detainees at risk. Noem called for the trio to be censured and rebuked by the House of Representatives, while Coleman denied the accusations, claiming ICE was "out of control."</p>

          <p>A controversial new single by Ye, also known as Kanye West, featuring antisemitic content and praising Hitler, has been banned on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, though it remains on X. The song references the Nazi salute and includes a sample from a Hitler speech, leading to its prohibition in Germany under Section 86a of the criminal code, which prohibits the dissemination of Nazi symbols and slogans. While Nazi symbols are not banned in the U.S. due to First Amendment protections, Germany strictly limits such expressions to overcome its Holocaust past. The Anti-Defamation League has also started a petition asking Facebook and Instagram to reinstate guidelines meant to protect users from disinformation and hate.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums after a judge's ruling and subsequent adoption by the California Insurance Commissioner. The decision grants the company a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company to address financial challenges following destructive wildfires. The increases will take effect on June 1, pending another hearing, with State Farm required to justify its financial condition and recovery plan. The decision has drawn backlash from fire survivors and state senators, but Insurance Commissioner Lara assured residents he weighed the options carefully amid a statewide insurance crisis, with the company agreeing to refrain from new non-renewal programs through 2025.</p>

The number of family offices is expected to grow to 10,720 by 2030, managing $5.4 trillion in assets, but the industry faces a potential shortage of 100,000 advisors by 2034. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, and compete with banks and private equity firms for talent, with some families willing to pay a salary premium for trusted individuals. Young employees are also reluctant to work at family offices due to unclear corporate structures and perceptions of it being a "retirement job."</p>

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils challenges the notion that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, suggesting the presence of polar ice 140 million years ago. During this time, the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes of up to 16 degrees Celsius, comparable to today's variations. Researchers from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research and other international institutions published their findings in Science Advances, indicating that the "Early Cretaceous greenhouse Earth was like a symphony – its warm melodies occasionally punctuated by brief glacial notes." Applying these findings to the present day offers insights into climate change, particularly concerning the ongoing reductions in Arctic and Antarctic ice.</p>

          <p>British businesses are warning the UK government that tightening immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors reliant on migrant staff, such as health and social care. The government plans to raise English-language requirements and skill levels for work visas, prioritizing British workers over overseas labor. Care England warns that ending overseas recruitment for social care visas could have serious consequences for a sector already facing 131,000 vacancies. Industry leaders acknowledge the need for boosting training among British workers but caution that labor shortages are likely to become more acute, with the Recruitment and Employment Confederation emphasizing the need for a controlled and responsive immigration system.</p>

While Putin's holding position is to give the impression that he wants to negotiate, Russian demands at the talks are likely to be the same as at the beginning of the conflict, which include Ukraine dropping its aspirations to join Nato, give up territories taken by Russia and scale back its military.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington’s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly proposed the idea to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, although Mr. Witkoff's spokesperson denied that the proposal had come up in the talks. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from multiple countries providing oversight. This venture would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could address U.S. concerns about Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Concerns have been raised regarding safety at HMP Five Wells, a UK prison now housing a high number of sexual offenders, leading to increased violence and self-harm. Reports from inmates and their families indicate a rise in attacks on sexual offenders, bullying, and drug use, with authorities allegedly doing little to address the issues. The prison's integration policy has led to a situation where general inmate populations are housed with sexual offenders, causing distress among prisoners, especially those who were abused as children. The Ministry of Justice data reveals that assaults increased by nearly 75% in 2024 compared to 11% nationally.</p>

Activist Natalia Panchenko notes an upsurge of anti-Ukrainian online abuse that has begun to manifest in real-life situations, with many Ukrainian refugees traumatized due to the war and the circumstances that forced them to seek refuge in Poland.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration reduced tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China lowered its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. Both nations will retain a portion of the tariffs, and the Trump administration will maintain levies related to fentanyl concerns. China has also agreed to suspend nontariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals, indicating a move towards easing trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

On the same day that Washington and Beijing announced their truce on tariffs, a Chinese government policy-setting document warned that “external forces” posed increasing “threats to China’s frontier regions, border areas, and security in its surrounding areas.” Despite a potential call between Trump and Xi, Beijing is steeling for a possible flare-up of tensions, repeating the pattern of relations during Mr. Trump’s first term.</p>

Buttigieg's remarks followed a town hall in Iowa, amidst speculation that he is considering a presidential run in 2028.
