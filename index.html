          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canada's prime minister, President Trump linked the tariff to stopping the flow of fentanyl and warned of higher levies if Canada retaliates. This new duty is separate from existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, further escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The Canadian government has stated it will continue to defend its workers and businesses while working toward the deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated NBA Summer League game, the Lakers' Bronny James and the Mavericks' Cooper Flagg competed in a matchup dubbed the "main event." While neither player had a standout shooting performance, the atmosphere was electric, with Dallas securing an 87-85 victory after James missed a potential game-winning shot. James finished with eight points, while Flagg, the first overall draft pick, scored ten. Both young players showed respect for each other's abilities after the intense game.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a renowned IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association after 60 years of membership. His decision is a protest against the planned five-day strike by resident doctors over a pay dispute with the government. Lord Winston argued that such strike action is inappropriate when the country is struggling and could damage public trust in the medical profession. The BMA maintains that the strike is necessary as doctors' real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008.</p>

The report highlights how misinformation on social media fuels these confrontations, creating a hostile environment that could deter people from public service.

This large-scale project aims to revive the river's natural flow and ecological health, addressing the long-standing damage caused by extensive hydropower development in the region.

The NAO also estimated the final cost to expand the fleet could be more than triple the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) initial forecast.

This boom, primarily in short-haul vehicles for industrial use, has prompted analysts to lower their diesel demand forecasts and accelerate their predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak.

This ruling comes after a recent Supreme Court decision that limited the scope of such injunctions but still allowed them through specific legal avenues like class-action suits. The White House criticized the decision, vowing to fight what it called an unlawful attempt to impede the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent pro-Palestinian activist and spokesperson during the Columbia University campus protests, has filed a complaint against the Trump administration seeking $20 million in damages. Khalil, who was detained by ICE for over three months, alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The complaint, a precursor to a lawsuit, claims his detention was a retaliatory act for his constitutionally protected speech. In lieu of payment, Khalil stated he would accept an official apology and an end to what his representatives call the administration's unconstitutional policy targeting activists.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared in Southern California as federal agents clashed with protesters during an immigration raid at a marijuana facility on a farm. Agents deployed irritants and made at least one arrest during the confrontation, which is one of several large-scale immigration operations conducted in the region recently. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the raids, stating the administration's tactics "evoke chaos, fear and terror." The increased enforcement actions are part of President Trump's directive to carry out the largest mass deportation program in U.S. history, which has included deploying troops to assist federal agents.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by the California Board of Parole Hearings. Bianchi, now 74, terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s with his cousin, murdering at least 12 women. After hearing opposition from victims and prosecutors, the panel determined he remains a risk and will not be eligible for another parole hearing for 10 years. Bianchi is currently serving multiple life sentences in a Washington state penitentiary for the murders he committed in both California and Washington.</p>

Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, comprising only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet.

          <p>As ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas remain stalled, an Israeli strike in central Gaza killed 15 people, including 10 children, at a health clinic. The U.S.-based charity Project HOPE, which runs the clinic, said the civilians were waiting outside to receive treatment for malnutrition and other illnesses when the missile hit. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" involved in the October 7th attack and said it was investigating the incident and regretted any harm to civilians.

The hockey-puck-shaped bone fragment, believed to be a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur, was unearthed from a bore hole drilled over 750 feet deep for a geothermal study. Museum officials described the find as astronomically unlikely, comparing it to a "hole in one from the moon." The 67.5-million-year-old fossil is now on display, marking the deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery in Denver's history.</p>

The Trump administration has implemented restrictions for national security reasons, effectively cutting off Nvidia's sales to China. The meeting highlights the critical intersection of the administration's trade policy, national security, and the rapidly growing AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is drawing criticism for stretching the limits of his legal authority. The president is citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same law at the center of a court challenge against his other "reciprocal" tariffs. Critics argue Trump is abusing the law by linking the tariff to Brazil's prosecution of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a matter unrelated to a U.S. national emergency. Furthermore, the letter incorrectly claims the U.S. has a trade deficit with Brazil, when it actually has a surplus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for creating effective political slogans. After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world, he identified eight key words that consistently resonate with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. The article explains that these words act as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies. While not a guarantee of victory, they provide powerful building blocks for campaigns, in contrast to more specific, single-issue slogans like "Get Brexit Done."</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult classic "Trainspotting," is releasing a new sequel and reflecting on the cultural changes since his debut novel. In an interview, Welsh expressed concern that the internet and AI are creating a "post-culture society," making people "dumbed down machines" by atrophying critical thought. He argues that the 1990s, the era his books depict, was a time when "people had lives," a sentiment he feels is nostalgic for younger generations. Welsh's new novel, "Men in Love," explores his characters' relationships as an antidote to the hate he sees in the modern world.</p>
