          <p>President Trump announced via social media that he is seriously considering bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public. These government-sponsored enterprises play a crucial role in America's housing financial system by buying mortgages from lenders, bundling them into mortgage-backed securities, and selling them to investors. Trump believes that the timing is right because these companies are performing well financially and generating substantial cash flow, potentially providing liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market. He plans to discuss this with his economic advisors before making a final decision. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, just days before the five-year anniversary of George Floyd’s death. This decision has sparked dismay among officials and residents who viewed the oversight as crucial for ending violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices within the department. Minneapolis officials have expressed their opposition to the withdrawal and reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the changes outlined in the federal agreement. Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison called the Trump administration's decision regrettable but predictable, emphasizing that it doesn't erase the DOJ's finding of racially discriminatory policing. </p>

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters after a judge declared the Trump administration's DOGE takeover unlawful. The ruling followed a lawsuit filed by USIP after they were forcibly removed from their positions in March. The USIP aims to provide analysis, education, and resources for global peace efforts and reduce the likelihood of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts. The Justice Department has not yet indicated whether it plans to appeal the judge's ruling, and a White House spokeswoman stated the administration's intent to reduce entities like USIP to their statutory minimum. </p>

          <p>NFL star Aaron Rodgers has publicly stated his opposition to biologically male transgender athletes competing in women's sports, labeling the transgender movement as "anti-woman" in the context of sports. Rodgers joins other former Green Bay Packers players in expressing this stance, coinciding with President Trump signing an executive order mandating institutions allow only biological females in women's athletics. A recent survey indicates that a majority of Americans, including a significant percentage of Democrats, disagree with allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports. The U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice are also investigating potential Title IX violations related to this issue. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has criticized the Trump administration for violating an order barring deportations to countries not of the deportees' origin without sufficient notice. The judge's rebuke followed the deportation of eight migrants who were reportedly told they were being sent to South Sudan, a violence-ridden country, but were flown to Djibouti. The judge is considering potential criminal contempt penalties and is seeking to provide the men with due process, including legal representation and interviews. Flight data indicates the deportation flight originated in Texas, stopped in Ireland, and ultimately landed in Djibouti, raising concerns about the deportees' final destination. </p>

          <p>Following a tornado in St. Louis that killed five people, Mayor Cara Spencer has placed the city's emergency manager on administrative leave due to the failure to activate tornado warning sirens.

The mayor's office has changed the siren activation protocol, assigning sole responsibility to the Fire Department, which will staff an office at all times.

          <p>Researchers at Harvard University propose a novel approach to treating mosquitoes with malaria drugs to prevent the spread of the disease, which kills nearly 600,000 people annually, primarily children. Unlike current efforts that focus on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, this method aims to eliminate the malaria parasites within the insects. The team identified a drug cocktail that can successfully rid mosquitoes of malaria when absorbed through their legs, with the long-term goal of coating bed nets with the drug. This approach addresses the growing problem of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. </p>

          <p>Researchers are advocating for the NHS to offer additional scans to women with very dense breasts to improve cancer detection rates and save lives. A Cambridge University-led study found that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly increase the number of cancers detected in this group. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, and cancers are harder to spot using traditional mammograms. The study suggests that implementing these alternative techniques could identify thousands of additional cancers per year. </p>

The administration maintains that the president's emergency declarations are not subject to judicial review and that only Congress can intervene. The lawsuit, led by the state of Oregon and joined by 11 other states, contests both the "Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs and tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada related to fentanyl production and trafficking. </p>

          <p>The New York Times has revealed a fierce debate among officials in the State, Justice, and Homeland Security Departments over the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite an order prohibiting it. D.H.S. officials discussed portraying Mr. Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader and downplaying the danger he faced in a Salvadoran prison. A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, who advocated for bringing Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., was fired. The case has raised concerns about due process and the administration's deportation policies. </p>

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to push for the passage of a massive budget package containing his second-term agenda, with GOP leaders aiming for a vote in the House. The meeting followed pressure from the president to fall in line, warning against grandstanding. The legislation faces opposition from both fiscal conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans concerned about provisions on state and local tax deductions. The bill's fate remains uncertain as leaders work to reconcile competing demands within the party. </p>

          <p>States and cities are bracing for hurricane and wildfire seasons with uncertainty due to significant cuts at federal agencies like FEMA and NOAA under President Trump. The administration's downsizing efforts threaten essential functions related to weather forecasting, emergency response, and long-term recovery, leading to concerns about less accurate forecasts and diminished financial aid. States are worried about their ability to rely on the federal government, particularly in the West, where wildfires are a growing threat. A former FEMA official stated that the agency has lost a quarter of its full-time staff. </p>

Under the terms of the deal, Mauritius will gain sovereignty over the islands, but the US and UK will continue operating the strategically important military base. The deal follows increasing international pressure on the UK to relinquish control of the islands, which were separated from Mauritius in 1965.

Cramer believes that the market will rebound once the budget negotiations conclude and the bill is passed.

While acknowledging the inflationary nature of the bill, Cramer maintains that the U.S. economy is robust enough to manage its debt and that better prices are on the horizon.

          <p>Texas lawmakers have advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, bringing the proposal closer to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a “life-threatening” condition as one capable of causing death. While the changes do not expand abortion access or include exceptions for rape or incest, the bill represents a shift for Texas Republicans who have long defended the law as written. </p>
