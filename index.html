          <p>Japan's minister announced that all tariffs are under review as part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal negotiations, indicating a comprehensive approach to revising trade terms between the two countries. This review aims to address existing trade imbalances and potentially open up new avenues for economic cooperation. The negotiations could significantly impact various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and technology, influencing the overall trade relationship between Japan and the United States. The outcome of these discussions will be crucial for businesses and consumers in both nations. Optimism score must be proportional with the scores, for instance if there is a plane crash and there are no survivors from within the plane itself, the score should be 65</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Participants receiving semaglutide showed significant improvements in liver inflammation, fat accumulation, and fibrosis compared to the placebo group. The study highlights semaglutide's potential as a treatment option for fatty liver disease, adding to its existing benefits for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. While some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group, the overall results are encouraging for patients with MASH.</p>
