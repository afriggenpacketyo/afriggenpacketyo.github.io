          <p>Former Kentucky police officer Brett Hankison received a 33-month prison sentence for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Hankison, the only officer convicted in connection with the incident, was found guilty of using excessive force by firing recklessly into Taylor's apartment. The sentencing followed a controversial recommendation from the Trump administration's Justice Department for only one day in prison, a position that drew outrage from Taylor's family and civil rights advocates.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a major shift in its long-standing business model, confirming it will transition from its famous open seating policy to assigned seats starting January 27, 2026. This change, which follows the recent elimination of its "bags fly free" policy, is part of a broader strategy to generate new revenue amid financial pressures. The airline is also overhauling its boarding process to group passengers by seat location, aiming to enhance the customer experience and offer new fare options like extra legroom.</p>

          <p>The Trump White House has barred a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for an upcoming trip to Scotland, citing the newspaper's recent story about an alleged letter from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the Journal's reporting "fake and defamatory conduct," a claim that follows a $20 billion libel lawsuit filed by Trump against the paper. The White House Correspondents' Association condemned the move as a violation of the First Amendment, highlighting a pattern of the administration retaliating against media outlets for unfavorable coverage.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones created tension by making a surprising public jab at star pass-rusher Micah Parsons, questioning his availability even if a new contract is signed by referencing his past injuries. In response, Parsons retweeted a critical post from former NFL player J.J. Watt, who sarcastically noted the poor timing of criticizing star players right before the season. The public friction comes as Parsons is negotiating a lucrative contract extension, seeking to be paid among the top defensive players in the league.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis from The Atlantic posits that Donald Trump's presidency is primarily driven by personal pettiness and a desire for retribution, rather than a coherent policy agenda. The article cites several examples, including retaliating against former officials like James Clapper, pressuring the Federal Reserve chairman for personal economic gain, and making policy decisions on Ukraine based on feeling slighted by Vladimir Putin. The author argues that this focus on settling personal scores taints the executive branch and leads to capricious governance focused on culture-war grievances instead of substantive national issues.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, along with 27 other nations including Canada, France, and Japan, has issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza and condemning Israel's handling of humanitarian aid. The statement describes the suffering of civilians as having reached "new depths" and criticizes Israel's aid delivery model as dangerous and inhumane, citing the hundreds of Palestinians killed while seeking food. The declaration represents a significant and candid international rebuke of Israel's military conduct and its impact on the civilian population.</p>

          <p>Activists, including mothers from Texas, held a protest near the White House to mourn the 27 children who died in the Camp Mystic flood and to demand government accountability.

The protesters condemned the Trump administration's inaction on the climate crisis and called for restored funding and a transition away from fossil fuels to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a move seen as a strategic overture to Beijing as President Javier Milei's administration seeks to rebalance its foreign policy. Effective Tuesday, Chinese citizens who hold valid visas for the United States or the European Union will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business. This policy change comes amid delays in trade negotiations with the U.S. and highlights Argentina's delicate diplomatic position as it navigates its relationships with both global superpowers.</p>

          <p>A new report from San Jose State University's Human Rights Institute reveals a staggering level of economic inequality in Silicon Valley, where just nine households now control 15% of the region's total wealth.

This concentration of riches exists alongside rising living costs, increased homelessness, and significant racial disparities in income for the region's workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current rate environment, short-term CDs often offer higher interest rates than long-term ones, making them an attractive option for parking a sum like $20,000. This article advises savers to consider three key factors: a short-term CD can provide protection against market fluctuations, but a long-term CD will likely yield more total interest over time despite a lower rate. Additionally, the best rates are typically found at online banks rather than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions, which may require savers to look beyond their regular bank for the most profitable opportunities.
