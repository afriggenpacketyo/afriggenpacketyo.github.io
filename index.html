        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, estimating a 60% chance of 13 to 19 named storms, with six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five potentially major hurricanes. The World Meteorological Organization sets the names for these storms, rotating them every six years, with deadly or costly storms having their names retired. The 2025 list includes Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and others, while notable retired names from previous years include Ian, Ida, and Katrina. Naming storms aids in communication and preparation efforts for meteorologists, media, and the public. </p>

          <p>Ukraine claims to have conducted its largest long-range attack on Russia, using smuggled drones to strike 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases, an operation the SBU security service dubbed "Spider's Web." President Zelenskyy said 117 drones were used, striking "34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers," and claimed the operation's headquarters were near the FSB of Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities reported a massive overnight drone and missile attack on their territory. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are set to meet in Istanbul for a second round of peace talks, though expectations remain low due to significant differences in their positions. </p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6 Capitol riot, is refusing a pardon issued by President Trump. Hemphill believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative about the events of January 6, stating that those involved were guilty. She sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's actions contrast with other January 6 defendants who sought to utilize their pardons in court. </p>

          <p>Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs have reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. This directive came after the New England Journal of Medicine published an article co-authored by two VA pulmonologists warning that staff reductions and contract cancellations jeopardize veterans' healthcare. Critics argue this move is part of a broader pattern of censorship and a "war on science" by the Trump administration, citing cuts to medical research funding. While the VA claims the policy is standard, VA workers and veterans advocates express concern over freedom of speech and potential harm to veterans. </p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury bonds, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy, due to concerns about economic volatility and stable yields. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) are among the top ETFs in investor flows this year. Berkshire Hathaway has doubled its ownership of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. This trend indicates a preference for lower-risk, shorter-duration investments amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
