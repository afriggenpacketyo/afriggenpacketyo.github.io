          <p>Pastor Ian Wilkinson delivered an emotional victim impact statement in the sentencing trial of Erin Patterson, who poisoned a Beef Wellington with death cap mushrooms, killing three people and leaving Wilkinson as the sole survivor. He expressed profound grief, stating he feels "half alive" without his wife, Heather, and deeply misses his closest friends, Don and Gail Patterson. Wilkinson, who required a liver transplant and faces ongoing respiratory issues, conveyed his forgiveness for Patterson's actions but stressed his commitment to seeking justice for those lost. Patterson, who claims the poisoning was accidental, attended the hearing and faces a potential life sentence for the murders and 25 years for attempted murder, as the court determines the severity of her punishment.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state anticipates slower economic growth in the latter half of the year. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, primarily driven by a decline in retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore projects moderate near-term inflation, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. This recent economic data strengthens the argument for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in its upcoming October meeting, aiming to provide a buffer against expected economic weakening.

          <p>European stock markets are projected to open slightly lower on Monday, as investors continue to assess the global economic outlook following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent suggestions of potential interest rate cuts. Major indices like Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB are expected to see slight declines, with UK markets closed for a public holiday. Attention will also be on individual company news, such as windfarm developer Orsted facing a U.S. project halt and Keurig Dr Pepper's announced acquisition of Dutch coffee company JDE Peet's. The trading week is set to feature a quiet start before a raft of inflation figures from key European countries and significant corporate earnings reports later on. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures up to 30C on bank holiday Monday, with the Midlands and northwest expecting the highest heat, and Wales potentially seeing its hottest late August bank holiday on record. However, this warm spell will be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are forecast to bring wet and windy weather across most of the UK overnight, starting in Northern Ireland. Temperatures are expected to drop significantly by Friday, and persistent rain is anticipated throughout the week, offering welcome relief after a particularly dry summer that has led to hosepipe bans and concerns for the harvest.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper is set to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in an approximately $18 billion transaction. The deal involves Keurig Dr Pepper paying JDE Peet's shareholders 31.85 euros per share, a 33% premium over its 90-day average stock price. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger that created North America's third-largest beverage company. This strategic move aims to reshape the company's structure and market presence in the beverage industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small contingent of National Guard members in Washington, D.C., fewer than 50, began carrying their assigned service weapons starting Sunday night, following a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This decision marks an escalation in President Trump's law enforcement crackdown in the capital, where nearly 2,000 Guard members are stationed. Previously, troops were unarmed and focused on protecting landmarks and crowd control. The new guidance allows force only as a last resort in response to imminent threats, though local officials question the necessity given declining violent crime rates in D.C. and the Guard's previous non-law enforcement role.</p>

This trend is evident in both the U.S., with slower nonfarm payroll growth, and the U.K., where job vacancies are falling across most sectors.

Relocation firms report a surge in inquiries, and statistics show significant increases in U.S. applications for Irish, French, and British citizenship. Celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres have also moved, expressing similar concerns. While the move offers relief from perceived threats, those relocating often feel sorrow for leaving loved ones and worry about the deeper societal issues they believe Trump's presidency represents, questioning when they might feel safe returning.</p>

          <p>China is on the verge of a significant turbine leap with a new floating wind power generation system that resembles an airship, designed for remote locations and disaster zones. Developed by Beijing SAWES Energy Technology Company in collaboration with Tsinghua University, the 1MW unit is preparing for a test flight. An earlier, smaller iteration successfully transmitted electricity to the ground from an altitude of 1,000 meters in January, proving the technology's feasibility. This innovation aims to provide power solutions where conventional supplies are inadequate, showcasing China's advancements in renewable energy technology.</p>

This shift, also pursued by industry giants like Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport, aims to personalize offers, increase airline revenue, and enable self-service changes.
