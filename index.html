          <h2>London Pride Faces Financial Uncertainty Amidst Decreased Corporate Sponsorship</h2>

          <p>Pride in London is proceeding with over a million attendees, but it and other UK Pride events face a precarious future due to funding shortages. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network reveals that over 85 organizations have seen reduced corporate sponsorships, with some attributing the decline to a shift in corporate DEI policies in the US. Consequently, some events have been canceled or are now charging for entry, though organizers remain resilient and committed to the movement's future.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully regenerated damaged outer ear tissue in mice by activating a dormant "genetic switch." The study, published in Science, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete tissue restoration, including cartilage, offering hope that a similar mechanism for organ repair could one day be applied to humans.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Media Focus on Bob Vylan's Glastonbury Chant Distorts Gaza Reality</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece critiques the media and political reaction to punk band Bob Vylan's "Death to the IDF" chant at Glastonbury. The author argues that framing the chant as antisemitic is a diversionary tactic that ignores the extensive death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The article suggests this narrative misleads the public, which is increasingly critical of Israel's military actions, and that such misrepresentations are becoming less effective as people see the reality of the conflict through other channels.</p>

          <p>Torrential overnight rains caused the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country to rise dramatically, leading to catastrophic flash floods that have killed at least 24 people. A significant search and rescue operation is underway for dozens of missing individuals, including 23 to 25 girls from a Christian summer camp. The rapid and unpredictable nature of the flood, which saw the river rise over 20 feet in hours, left no time for evacuation orders, creating a devastating situation for residents and campers.</p>

          <p>A former federal prosecutor suggests that Sean "Diddy" Combs may face a significant prison sentence despite being acquitted of his most serious sex trafficking charges. The expert points to the trial judge's decision to deny bail, citing Diddy's "propensity for violence," as a signal that he may lean towards the prosecution's higher sentencing guidelines. While Combs was convicted on a lesser charge of transportation to engage in prostitution, the judge's comments hint at a potential sentence far exceeding the two years his defense team has argued for.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a U.S. naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The ruling clarified an earlier order, stating a lower court could not block the removal to a third country. This decision is a key development in the administration's policy of deporting migrants to nations other than their own, despite concerns from dissenting justices and human rights lawyers about the potential for torture or death in the destination country.</p>

          <p>The massive tax and spending bill recently passed by Congress permanently extends most of the 2017 tax cuts while boosting funding for defense and border security. It introduces new restrictions and work requirements for Medicaid and the SNAP food stamp program, which the CBO estimates will cause millions to lose health coverage. The bill also raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, terminates many green energy tax credits, and raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>
