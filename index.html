          <p>Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip have resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians, with reports indicating a potential escalation of Israel's offensive in the region. Health officials reported that at least 38 individuals lost their lives in recent attacks, with over 200 sustaining injuries, though these figures exclude victims in northern Gaza due to access limitations. Airstrikes targeted areas such as Khan Younis, Jabalia, and Nuseirat, resulting in the deaths of a local journalist and a senior rescue service official. The Israeli military has increased operations in Gaza, targeting over 100 sites in the past day, with Prime Minister Netanyahu announcing plans to take control of the entire Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has once again targeted Harvard University, following a judge's decision to block the administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump stated that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." He added that the administration wants to "to know who those foreign students are" and that "Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming." This attack comes after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the revocation, which Harvard argued was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment."</p>

          <p>A former West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration's changes to the academy, objecting to the president's wearing of a Make America Great Again hat. Parsons stated that making cadets salute the president in the hat crossed a line for him, as Trump struggles to separate the office of the presidency from himself. Trump signed an executive order ending DEI programs in the armed forces, leading Parsons to publish an op-ed stating that West Point began eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology. Parsons called the orders indoctrination, not education, and a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education.</p>

She clarified that recent looting of aid trucks was due to desperate individuals, not organized crime or Hamas. McCain urged the world community to apply diplomatic pressure to ensure consistent aid delivery at scale, and stated that the WFP is willing to collaborate with any entity that can facilitate feeding people safely.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a lead at the first corner and maintaining it throughout the race. The race saw minimal intervention from the safety car, leading to relatively straightforward strategies for the front-runners, including Leclerc and Piastri, who finished second and third, respectively. Verstappen faced a disadvantage due to limited tire availability, leading Red Bull to adopt an inverted strategy, hoping for a crash and red flag to maintain his lead. Ultimately, Verstappen had to pit with one lap to go, dropping to fourth place.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the recently passed budget bill as the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while downplaying concerns that the package will increase federal deficits. Despite a Congressional Budget Office analysis suggesting the tax provisions could raise the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, Johnson rejected the analysis as "dramatically overstated." He asserted that the bill would stimulate the economy by increasing wages, incentivizing U.S. manufacturing, and empowering job creators and entrepreneurs. However, Republican senators have expressed skepticism and signaled plans to modify the bill due to deficit concerns.</p>

          <p>The bodies of five skiers were discovered near Switzerland's Zermatt resort, following a search initiated after unattended skis were reported near the Rimpfischhorn peak. The victims were found at varying altitudes on avalanche debris on the Adler Glacier, with an investigation launched to determine the accident's circumstances. Zermatt is a popular Alpine resort, but the climb to Rimpfischhorn is considered a more challenging expedition. In a separate incident, Air Zermatt also conducted a mountain rescue on the FiescherhÃ¶rner, successfully evacuating four alpinists stranded amid fog and high winds.</p>

          <p>An analysis finds that the Trump administration has monetized the presidency to an unprecedented degree, normalizing activities that would have previously sparked outrage and investigations. The Trump family and its business partners have amassed significant wealth through various ventures, including cryptocurrency fees, overseas real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. A luxury jet was donated for Mr. Trump's use, valued at $200 million, dwarfing all foreign gifts to previous presidents. Critics argue that the lack of accountability and the dismantling of ethical safeguards have enabled the president to operate with impunity, blurring the lines between public service and personal gain.</p>

This is a rare occasion, as a British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977, and not opened a brand new session of parliament since 1957. Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by suggesting it would be better off as a US state. The visit is also a way for Prime Minister Carney to improve the relationship with Trump, who is famously a fan of the British monarchy and its history.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Prostate Cancer Screening Guidelines After Biden's Diagnosis</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joe Bidenâ€™s prostate cancer diagnosis has sparked a debate regarding the current prostate cancer screening guidelines, particularly for men over 70. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that men aged 55 to 69 discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA screening with their healthcare provider, while advising against screenings for men over 70. Some experts argue that this recommendation is flawed, emphasizing that men over 45 should have access to this screening, regardless of age. They note that treatment options have advanced and are now better tolerated with fewer side effects for patients at various stages.</p>

          <p>The government cannot promise train tickets will get cheaper under renationalisation, as South Western Railway (SWR) was brought into public ownership on Sunday. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the day-to-day running of trains was already heavily subsidised by the taxpayer. The focus will instead be on improving services and infrastructure, she said. Some members of the public questioned the point of renationalising train operators if it did not reduce prices. The Conservative Party said Labour had "talked up the benefits of renationalisation for years and they will now have to deliver on their promises of lower ticket prices".</p>

          <p>Dr. Timothy Johnson, long-time ABC News medical editor and founding editor of the Harvard Medical School Health Letter, criticizes the Trump administration's recent budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health. He argues that these cuts, totaling more than $1.8 billion, will cause terrible damage to many outstanding research programs and destroy the careers of many young medical scientists. Johnson suggests that these researchers may find positions in other countries, leading to a "brain drain." He calls for a more surgical approach that would find legitimate savings without destroying the research infrastructure that has served the country so well for decades.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are debating whether to shift from protecting individual species to protecting entire ecosystems. While the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been effective, it focuses on saving the most imperiled species rather than preventing populations from crashing. An ecosystem-protection act could categorize lands and fresh water into ecosystem types and ensure that each type has sufficient area protected. The challenge lies in defining and categorizing ecosystems, but a robust network of protected ecosystems would support most of Americaâ€™s species. The article suggests this could be a unifying cause, as love for American landscapes is bipartisan.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decisions, particularly those involving presidential authority, have raised concerns about the consolidation of power in the presidency. An order involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards has effectively allowed the president to neutralize independent expertise within the executive branch. Critics argue that this decision undermines lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law and emboldens an administration eager to trample it. The court's actions risk assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law, potentially leading to further actions outside the traditional constitutional order.</p>
