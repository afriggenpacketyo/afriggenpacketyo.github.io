        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported Trump administration plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential move an "invasion." Pritzker stated his office has not been contacted about the deployment and suggested President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The White House dismissed his concerns, criticizing the city's crime rates, while the move raises legal questions about federal authority over state National Guard forces, similar to recent controversial deployments in other major cities.</p>

          <p>Musician Cardi B took the stand in a civil trial where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, an allegation she denies. Her animated testimony and sharp responses during cross-examination have gone viral, with clips circulating widely on social media. The case centers on a verbal altercation where the guard claims the rapper, who was pregnant at the time, spat on her and cut her with a fingernail. Questions from the opposing lawyer about her wigs and nails also drew significant online commentary and debate.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars in television ads are set to begin airing in California for a special election concerning Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would redraw the state's congressional district maps. This unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, championed by Democrats, aims to counter potential Republican gains in other states and shift control of the U.S. House. Opponents, a bipartisan coalition including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, argue it undermines the state's independent redistricting commission and allows politicians to choose their voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that was previously approved by Congress, affecting 15 international programs. President Trump utilized a rarely used procedure known as a "pocket rescission" to withhold the funds without direct congressional approval, a move some lawmakers, including Republican Senator Susan Collins, have called illegal. The majority of the cuts will impact USAID and peacekeeping missions, drawing criticism from Democrats who warn the action could increase the likelihood of a future government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old woman in Maine has been arrested on multiple charges after allegedly trying to run over U.S. Border Patrol agents with her car. The incident occurred while the agents were assisting state and local police with the arrest of two undocumented immigrants following a vehicle accident. Authorities from the Department of Homeland Security stated the woman, a bystander, began verbally abusing the officers before using her vehicle to swerve at them. The DHS linked the event to a broader trend of increased assaults against federal immigration officers.</p>

          <p>A charity program is helping teenagers with anxiety and poor school attendance by pairing them as mentors for toddlers at local nurseries. The initiative aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the older students, which has led to significant improvements in their engagement with education. Participants report that the bond formed with the younger children has helped them feel calmer and more focused. The program provides a novel approach to tackling the complex issue of school avoidance, which has risen since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of President Trump's tariff policies are illegal, stating they overstep the authority granted to the president under U.S. law. The 7-4 decision found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used for justification, does not explicitly grant the power to impose tariffs. The ruling specifically voids the "Liberation Day" and "reciprocal" tariffs, though it will not take effect until October 14, pending a likely appeal to the Supreme Court. The White House has defended the tariffs as lawful and necessary for national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine indicates that young children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication, such as stimulants, too quickly after their diagnosis. The research, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that 42% of diagnosed children aged 3 to 5 were prescribed drugs within 30 days. Clinical guidelines recommend starting with behavioral intervention first, as medication can have side effects like irritability and emotional problems in this age group.

          <p>The UK's Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court injunction, allowing 138 asylum seekers to remain housed at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was sought by the local council following protests and claims of planning rule breaches. However, the appellate court ruled the original decision was "seriously flawed" as it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants. The ruling is a victory for the government, which feared a precedent that could fuel legal challenges from other councils seeking to block the use of hotels for asylum accommodation.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the controversy over the cover of her new album, "Man’s Best Friend," which depicts her on her knees at a man's feet. Speaking on "CBS Mornings," Carpenter expressed shock at the backlash, stating the image's meaning was not a topic of concern among her inner circle. She explained her artistic interpretation involves exploring themes of control and the lack of it, and the humanity of making mistakes. Amid the debate, the artist released an alternative, "approved by God" cover showing her simply standing next to a man.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new crime comedy "Caught Stealing," directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Austin Butler, is set in 1998 New York City and aims for a gritty, nostalgic thriller aesthetic. The film follows a bartender who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld, but the review finds it prioritizes style over substance. While Aronofsky successfully captures the atmosphere of a bygone Lower Manhattan, the characters are described as cartoonish and the plot as disposable. Despite a talented cast, the movie is ultimately seen as a forgettable effort that recalls a lesser-quality rental from the era it depicts.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new congressional map, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, which is designed to create five new safe Republican seats and solidify the party's control. The redistricting plan is a high-stakes gamble that relies on the GOP's recent electoral gains with Hispanic voters, as four of the new districts are Hispanic-majority. However, some Latino voters and Democratic leaders express skepticism, pointing to economic struggles and immigration policies under the Trump administration that could erode that support. The outcome will be a critical test of shifting political allegiances within the state's largest demographic group.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has blocked the scheduled execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate who had been sentenced to die by firing squad. His attorneys successfully argued that his dementia is so severe he can no longer understand why he is being executed, which would make the act unconstitutional. The court ordered a lower court to reevaluate Menzies' competency, acknowledging the suffering of the victim's family but emphasizing their duty to uphold the rule of law. Menzies was convicted for the 1986 abduction and murder of Maurine Hunsaker.</p>

The article argues that this embrace of crypto is a departure from the technology's anti-establishment origins and serves primarily as another form of self-promotion, raising ethical questions about conflicts of interest.
