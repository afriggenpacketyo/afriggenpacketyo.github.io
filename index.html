          <h2>CBS to Conclude 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' in 2026 Amid Political Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 06:42:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," with its final season concluding in May 2026. The decision follows days after Colbert publicly criticized the network's parent company, Paramount, for a $16 million legal settlement paid to President Donald Trump, which Colbert labeled a "bribe." While the network cited purely financial reasons for the cancellation, the timing has prompted prominent Democratic senators and critics to question whether the move was politically motivated retaliation for Colbert's outspoken views. The cancellation marks the end of the entire "Late Show" franchise, as the host will not be replaced.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, faces charges of hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a Cessna 172 aircraft. He allegedly threatened a flight instructor and flew the plane from Victoria to Vancouver, prompting NORAD to scramble F-15 fighter jets. Authorities state the suspect acted with an "ideological motive to disrupt airspace," linked to social media posts where he claimed to be a messiah sent to warn humanity about climate change. Former employers described Cassim as a highly intelligent pilot but noted he believed the world was ending, leaving them surprised by his actions.</p>

          <h2>UK Met Office Issues Amber Warning for Severe Thunderstorms and Flash Flooding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 06:33:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Met Office has issued an amber warning for parts of southeast and eastern England, anticipating torrential thunderstorms and significant flash flooding. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain, potentially up to 100mm, could fall in just a few hours, creating hazardous conditions including frequent lightning and large hail. The severe weather is expected to cause major transport disruptions. This intense rainfall follows a period of heatwaves that have left soils baked dry, which increases runoff and flood risk as the ground cannot absorb water quickly, exacerbating the effects of the ongoing drought.</p>

          <p>Health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are projected to increase by an average of 15% next year, with some plans rising by 20% or more. This record-setting pace is largely attributed to the Republican-led Congress allowing enhanced ACA subsidies, first enacted in 2021, to expire. The lapse in these subsidies, which had nearly doubled marketplace enrollment, is expected to make coverage unaffordable for millions, leading healthier individuals to drop their plans. This shift leaves a sicker, more expensive patient pool, forcing insurers to raise rates to cover the increased costs.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved its 18th sanctions package against Russia, which includes lowering the price cap on Russian crude oil to further limit Moscow's war-funding revenues. The new cap, part of a G7 and EU initiative, will be set just above $47 per barrel, a significant reduction from the previous $60 threshold. These measures are designed to curtail Russia's economic strength while keeping its oil on the global market to prevent price shocks.

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is causing an unprecedented fracture within his loyal base. Unlike past controversies, Trump's insistence that Epstein committed suicide and his refusal to release the alleged client list have failed to be smothered by his usual distraction tactics. This has led to open criticism from key MAGA influencers like Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who sense a cover-up. The author suggests this issue resonates deeply because it touches on core QAnon-adjacent beliefs about exposing elite corruption, and Trump's failure to deliver on this front makes him appear like a lame-duck president to his followers.</p>

          <p>A Human Rights Watch researcher argues that the Trump administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians is dangerously disconnected from the reality on the ground.

The author, who recently visited Haiti, details accounts of killings and gang-related sexual assaults, noting that criminal groups control nearly 90% of the capital.

Figures like former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel represent the centrist view, arguing the party's brand is "toxic," while governors like Minnesota's Tim Walz push for a more aggressive, populist agenda.

This move allows Sarcone to retain his powers indefinitely, bypassing traditional Senate confirmation and judicial oversight. The appointment has drawn scrutiny due to Sarcone's credibility issues, including listing a boarded-up building as his residence and making a disproven claim about being attacked by an undocumented immigrant.

Although the current map was drawn just a few years ago, the Justice Department has alleged that four Democratic-held districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Critics argue the move is a purely political power grab with no legal justification, as state officials previously testified the map was drawn "blind to race."

          <p>HMP Pentonville in London has been put into special measures after an inspection revealed it illegally detained inmates past their release dates due to inaccurate sentence calculations. The chief inspector of prisons issued an urgent notification, citing that 130 inmates were held too long over a six-month period. The report described "frightening" and chaotic conditions, with widespread cockroach infestations, dirty cells, and most prisoners locked up for over 22 hours a day. Inspectors also found "shockingly poor" oversight of prisoners on suicide watch, with one officer found asleep, following three suicides at the jail in 2025.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a measure to claw back $9 billion from the federal budget, a key priority for the Trump administration. The bill, which passed 216-213, includes significant funding reductions for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The legislation formalizes cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency and now heads to President Trump for his signature. While House Speaker Mike Johnson celebrated the passage and promised more rescission bills, some Republicans expressed concern over the cuts, particularly to public broadcasting in rural communities.

          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps defended the decision to use a super-injunction to conceal a major data breach involving thousands of Afghans who worked with the British government. He stated the primary focus was on "sorting out the mess and saving lives," as those on the leaked list were at risk of murder by the Taliban. The breach, which inadvertently exposed the data of nearly 19,000 Afghan applicants and over 100 British officials, was not discovered for over a year. Shapps argued that keeping the leak secret was a necessary precaution to prevent harm, though the government has since established a resettlement scheme for those affected.</p>

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing the rules to bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit, aiming to prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt. The changes mean some shoppers may be refused credit, and providers must offer clearer information and faster access to refunds. While charities welcome the move for providing greater consumer protection, regulators estimate providers' profits could drop by £1.4 billion due to fewer transactions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the deaths of 27 people at a Texas summer camp, experts are urging parents to ask camps detailed questions about their safety protocols for extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods. With no federal standards specific to camps and varied state-level oversight, it falls on parents to verify preparedness. Key questions include how camps mitigate heat illness with shade and hydration schedules, whether they are located in a floodplain, and what their specific emergency action plans are for flash floods or wildfires. Experts stress that generic answers are not sufficient and that camps should be able to detail their procedures for monitoring weather and communicating during a crisis.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported that serious water pollution incidents by water companies in England surged by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest level on record. There were 75 incidents classified as causing serious harm to health and wildlife, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. A cross-party committee of MPs described the pollution level as "woeful" and blamed a failure of regulation and years of underinvestment in infrastructure by the water companies. In response, industry group Water UK acknowledged poor performance but pointed to regulators for previously suppressing bill increases needed for necessary investments.</p>

The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, such as not working illegally or overstaying.

This contrasts sharply with countries like Germany, where digital uptake is lower due to less convenient systems.

While national networks receive a small portion of their budgets from federal funds, many smaller local stations, especially in rural areas, rely heavily on the subsidy and warn they could be forced off the air.
