        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene resigned after failing to secure enough support in a confidence vote, triggered by public protests over inequality, corruption, and rising living costs. Oyun-Erdene received only 44 votes in the 126-seat parliament, falling short of the required 64 votes to remain in office. He warned that the confidence motion could cause instability and threaten democracy in the country, which adopted democracy after the fall of the Soviet Union. The protests were fueled by reports of lavish spending by Oyun-Erdene's son and Mongolia's drop in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index since he took office in 2021. He will remain in a caretaker role until a successor is appointed within 30 days.</p>

          <p>The UN secretary-general has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution center in Gaza, amidst disputed reports that Israeli forces had opened fire on people waiting to collect aid. Witnesses reported being shot at while waiting for food from the center in Rafah run by the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Red Cross reported receiving 179 casualties, including 21 deaths, while the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency put the death toll at 31. Israel denies its troops fired at civilians, while the GHF calls the reports "outright fabrications." The UN human rights chief described the aid delivery situation as "unacceptable" and "dehumanizing."</p>

They claim they were interrogated and tortured before being dumped near the borders of their countries, and have filed a complaint against the Tanzanian authorities. Atuhaire, who won the EU Human Rights Defenders' Award in 2023, stated that she refused to be silenced by the shame of being a victim of sexual assault.</p>

He ended up in a five-man playoff with Rickie Fowler, Cameron Young, Eric Cole, and Chase Johnson, where Young secured the final spot with a birdie on hole 38. Homa is still not entirely out of the U.S. Open, as he is playing the Canadian Open this week, though he would likely have to win to get into the top 60 and qualify.</p>

The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, following sanctions against Abramovich after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Abramovich wants the money to go to "all victims of the war in Ukraine," while the UK government insists it should only be used for humanitarian efforts inside Ukraine.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is intensifying its efforts to prevent transgender athletes from participating in school sports in California, warning school districts of potential legal consequences if they do not comply. Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon argues that allowing transgender athletes to compete violates the U.S. Constitution by depriving girls of athletic opportunities based on biological sex. Dhillon has requested that districts confirm in writing by June 9 that they are no longer complying with California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) rules allowing transgender athletes to compete. This action follows a recent rule change by CIF to allow cisgender girls bumped from qualifying events by a transgender athlete to compete anyway, a move that has drawn criticism from both sides.</p>

These activities, though not military operations, carry a military message and place immense pressure on Taiwan. Official communication between Beijing and Taipei has been suspended since 2016, increasing the potential for miscalculation.</p>

However, pitcher Tyler Glasnow is experiencing body discomfort after throwing his first bullpen session since being placed on the injured list in April with shoulder inflammation. Glasnow's return timeline is uncertain, while Blake Snell is making progress and could begin throwing bullpens next week. Michael Kopech is completing a minor-league rehab assignment, and Kirby Yates threw his second bullpen session since suffering a hamstring strain.</p>
