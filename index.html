          <p>Kenyan athletes celebrated a dual victory at the 51st Berlin Marathon, with Sabastian Sawe winning the men's race and Rosemary Wanjiru securing the women's title. Despite Berlin's reputation as a fast course, the unusually humid late-summer conditions resulted in times that were significantly slower than world records. The event drew over 55,000 runners, including several celebrities, who were supported by hundreds of thousands of spectators along the route through the German capital. The massive logistical effort included distributing over a million cups of water to keep participants hydrated.</p>

          <p>The social media phenomenon known as "RushTok" provides a detailed look into the sorority recruitment process at southern universities, particularly the University of Alabama. This article analyzes the specific fashion trends, from fast-fashion items to luxury goods, that define the "potential new member" aesthetic, with some outfits totaling over $26,000. It also explores the immense pressure and financial commitment involved in the highly competitive process. The piece further examines the underlying social and racial dynamics, noting the persistent lack of diversity within these historically white institutions.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane. The National Hurricane Center expects the storm's center to pass east of Bermuda but remain over open waters, posing no direct threat to land. However, swells generated by Gabrielle are predicted to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada, into early next week. So far, the hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

          <p>Tong Jilu, the former executive director of China Tower, is under investigation for corruption by the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Tong was a key figure in China's 5G development and played a crucial role in the company's growth into a telecommunications infrastructure giant since its establishment in 2014. While details of the investigation are scarce, reports suggest his case may be connected to another high-profile corruption probe involving a former chairman at a major state-backed brokerage firm.

          <p>Major credit card issuers like American Express and Chase are increasing annual fees for their premium travel rewards cards, with some now costing over $800 per year. These hikes make it crucial for consumers to assess whether the value of the card's perks, such as lounge access and travel credits, outweighs the significant cost. Experts advise that these cards are generally not worthwhile for individuals who carry a balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any benefits. Before applying, consumers should consider their travel habits and whether a general or brand-specific card best suits their needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing criticism from charities and universities for its policy that prevents scholarship students evacuated from Gaza from bringing their families with them. While 34 students were brought to Britain to begin their studies, tighter immigration rules bar them from being accompanied by dependents. This has forced some students to choose between their education and leaving their loved ones, including young children, behind in a conflict zone.

          <p>This article argues that political pressure on the Federal Reserve to manipulate interest rates for short-term economic boosts poses a significant danger to long-term stability.

The recent case of Turkey, where political interference led to 80% inflation, serves as a modern cautionary tale.

These properties offer small, private rooms with shared communal spaces, attracting young professionals with the promise of a built-in community and flexible leases. However, long-time residents and community boards express concern that these transient-focused, high-rent developments are accelerating gentrification, displacing local populations, and eroding the historical character of their communities.

For years, Kimmel has been a major ambassador for the Hollywood Boulevard area, and his show's presence drew tourists and supported local businesses like fruit vendors and restaurants. Now, industry officials and local workers worry about the economic impact of the show's absence on a neighborhood still recovering from recent industry strikes.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move aimed at increasing diplomatic pressure for a two-state solution and a lasting peace in the Middle East. The decision follows a deadline the UK government had set for Israel to agree to a ceasefire and allow UN aid into Gaza. This largely symbolic step is being taken despite opposition from key allies, including the United States and Israel. The UK's action comes as other nations like France and Canada are also preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood ahead of the UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is urging the communications regulator Ofcom to investigate Elon Musk and his social media platform, X. Davey alleges that "crimes" are being committed on the platform through the presence of harmful and illegal content, in violation of the UK's Online Safety Act. The call for action follows recent clashes between Davey and Musk, particularly after Musk's appearance at a far-right rally where he made controversial remarks about migration and violence. The Liberal Democrats plan to summon Musk to appear before Parliament to be held accountable.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011 has been published in which Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referred to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "steadfast, generous and supreme friend." The email was sent shortly after she had publicly stated that her involvement with Epstein was a "gigantic error of judgment" and vowed to have no further contact. A spokesperson for the duchess explained that the email was sent in an effort to dissuade Epstein from suing her for defamation after her public condemnation. The spokesperson reiterated that the duchess's first thoughts are with Epstein's victims.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that societies in both the United States and Britain are experiencing a dangerous normalization of hate and a deficit of empathy that corrodes democracy and social cohesion. The author, reflecting on personal experiences with racism and observing broader trends of political division, calls for empathy to become a public practice woven into all aspects of life. Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the article suggests that radical love and mutual respect are the only forces capable of healing a world addicted to grievance and division.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Guinea are voting in a referendum on a new constitution that could allow the country's military leader, General Mamady Doumbouya, to run for president. The proposed changes are controversial as they would also extend presidential terms from five to seven years and make it more difficult for political parties to compete in elections. The vote is being boycotted by the two main opposition leaders, whose parties are currently suspended, leading to expectations that the constitution will pass.

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a covert, Russian-funded disinformation network attempting to disrupt Moldova's upcoming parliamentary elections. Using an undercover reporter, the investigation found that the network pays participants to post pro-Russian propaganda and fake news aimed at undermining the country's pro-EU ruling party. The operation, linked to a sanctioned oligarch, also involved conducting an illegal poll to create a pretext for questioning the legitimacy of the election results. The findings highlight Russia's ongoing malign influence operations in Eastern Europe, with Moldova being a key strategic target.</p>

          <p>California's Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a controversial 2022 decision by state regulators that slashed payments to homeowners for their excess solar power by 75%. The ruling is a significant victory for environmental groups and the solar industry, which argued the cuts unfairly burdened consumers and caused a dramatic 82% drop in rooftop solar installations. The high court's decision signals that the policy, which was heavily criticized for disincentivizing clean energy adoption, will face renewed legal scrutiny. This could potentially lead to the restoration of more favorable rates for solar panel owners.</p>

          <p>More than a decade after her death, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national in connection with the 2012 murder of Agnes Wanjiru. The 21-year-old mother's body was found in a septic tank in Nanyuki, a town that hosts a British army base, and an inquest concluded she was killed by one or two British soldiers. If an extradition occurs, it would mark the first time a current or former British soldier has been sent abroad to stand trial for the murder of a civilian. The development is a significant step in the long-running campaign for justice for Wanjiru.</p>
