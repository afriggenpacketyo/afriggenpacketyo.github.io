          <p>The United States and Iran initiated detailed discussions in Oman concerning Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment. These negotiations aim to curtail Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the removal of some economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. While President Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal, he also mentioned the possibility of military action if negotiations fail. Experts from both sides are participating, and Iran insists on maintaining its enrichment capabilities, but the U.S. has presented conflicting demands regarding enrichment levels.</p>

          <p>A parenting coach warns against the overused phrase "you're okay" when a child experiences an emotional event, arguing it can cause long-term damage. The phrase teaches children to doubt their emotions, invalidates their experiences, and short-circuits emotional processing. It can also condition children to suppress their emotions to remain accepted and rewire their stress response. Instead, parents should validate and support their children's feelings to foster emotional resilience and safety.</p>

Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors by fabricating his backstory. The judge gave the former U.S. representative the maximum sentence of 87 months, and ordered him to pay more than $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture. Santos expressed remorse, but prosecutors argued he remains unrepentant. The sentencing marks the end of a tumultuous period for the former congressman.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, hinting at potential concessions while digging in on key demands.

While some aspects may be nonstarters for Russia, the proposal suggests a willingness to find common ground, particularly regarding territory and NATO membership.
