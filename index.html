          <h2>Green Party Leader Calls for Withdrawal of Single-Sex Guidance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 11:04:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Green Party is urging the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to retract its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer asserts the guidance, issued after a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' by biological sex, risks discriminating against trans people. The guidance suggests trans women may be excluded from women's facilities in certain contexts. Denyer voices concerns about the potential for discrimination in workplaces and the impact on lesbian associations wanting to include trans women, questioning the practicality of enforcing such guidelines and the impact on trans individuals.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's trade negotiation tactics, describing them as "strategic uncertainty." He stated that while he does not know if Trump has spoken with President Xi, he believes China will find the high tariff levels unsustainable. Bessent anticipates a trade deal with China could take months but suggests an agreement in principle, coupled with good behavior from trading partners, could prevent tariffs from escalating. Regarding investor confidence, Bessent downplayed concerns, attributing recent market fluctuations to statistical or market noise, emphasizing the long-term focus on establishing strong economic fundamentals.

          <p>The Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) reports a significant increase in requests for church asylum, driven by growing fears of deportation among refugees. Some regions have seen requests nearly quadruple, though the high demand means many cannot be accommodated. This rise comes as the incoming government plans to increase deportations. The EKD defends church asylum as a last resort, granted after careful consideration, to allow asylum cases to be reevaluated, particularly in Dublin cases where individuals are slated for deportation to another EU country.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would only reduce tariffs on China if they offer something "substantial" in return, during a press gaggle on Air Force One. He specified that he wants China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products, allowing them to freely operate within the country. Trump suggested that a previous deal, which would have allowed the U.S. to sell its products in China, was close to completion before China backed out. He expressed uncertainty about whether he would even ask for China to open up, as they may be unwilling to do so.</p>

Ford believed the U.S. had a "profound moral obligation" to those who supported the alliance with America. Despite initial challenges, the refugees integrated into American society, becoming small business owners and contributors, including federal judges and an Oscar-winning actor.

          <p>Following the NFL Draft, the Pittsburgh Steelers appear to be the frontrunner to acquire free agent quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The Minnesota Vikings' acquisition of Sam Howell suggests they are no longer pursuing Rodgers, leaving Pittsburgh as the primary contender.

The Steelers' draft strategy, prioritizing other positions over quarterback, indicates their confidence in potentially signing Rodgers, who would join an offense bolstered by the addition of D.K.

The industry is strategically reallocating resources amid evolving market dynamics, including the emergence of new players and geopolitical factors. Power availability, along with fiber, water, and land, is becoming a critical factor in data center development, with long-term enterprise adoption expected to drive demand for the next decade.</p>

          <p>Despite political headwinds and supply chain issues, the U.S. wind energy industry is entering a "repowering" era, upgrading or replacing aging turbines to boost electricity output.

Repowering existing sites offers economic benefits, such as avoiding property acquisition costs and increasing electricity generation with more efficient turbines.

          <p>Donald Trump's tariffs on Taiwanese exports have created uncertainty in Taiwan regarding the reliability of American support. The Lai administration was blindsided by the 32% levy, which sent shock waves through key sectors like hi-tech manufacturing. Frustration increased when Taiwan was excluded from the first round of trade negotiations during a 90-day grace period. The omission of Taiwan raised questions over whether the island’s strategic value was being judged mainly by what it could deliver economically and militarily.</p>

However, there are alternative forms of identification, such as a valid U.S. passport or permanent resident card, that can be used in lieu of a Real ID. Experts recommend travelers arrive at the airport at least 1.5 hours before their flight due to potential delays in security lines.

These include assuming your partner can read your mind, keeping score of good deeds and missteps, engaging in passive-aggressive behavior, backseat driving your partner's life, and listening only to respond rather than to understand. The therapist emphasizes the importance of clear communication, giving without expecting anything in return, and offering support rather than unsolicited advice.
