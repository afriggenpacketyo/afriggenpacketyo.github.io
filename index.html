          <p>A woman was stopped by the TSA at Miami International Airport after being discovered hiding two turtles inside her bra. The animals were wrapped in gauze and plastic, and one of them unfortunately died. The TSA used the incident to remind the public on social media that while pets are allowed through security, they must be properly declared and carried, not concealed on one's body. The surviving turtle was handed over to the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife for care.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Notre Dame discovered per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in a significant portion of tested reusable period products. These toxic chemicals, linked to cancer and other health issues, can be absorbed through the skin and also contaminate the environment upon disposal. The study emphasizes that not all products contained PFAS, suggesting their use is unnecessary, and calls on consumers to demand PFAS-free options to drive industry change.</p>

          <p>A legal battle is escalating over President Trump's authority to fire members of independent federal agencies, with a focus on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The case, Slaughter v. Trump, directly challenges the nearly century-old Supreme Court precedent of Humphrey's Executor, which limits a president's power to remove commissioners without cause. Legal experts suggest the current Supreme Court may be inclined to overturn or narrow this precedent, potentially increasing presidential control over agencies like the FTC.

          <p>An early morning shooting in a University of New Mexico dormitory has resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and injury to a 19-year-old. The incident occurred while four people were playing video games in a dorm room, leading to the suspect, an 18-year-old, opening fire. New Mexico State Police have since arrested the suspect and charged him with first-degree murder and other offenses. The shooting, which took place during new student orientation, has prompted the university to offer counseling services to the community.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese voters have rejected a large-scale effort to recall 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT), a China-friendly party. The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature where an opposition bloc currently holds the majority. This outcome means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance to its agenda. The recall campaigns were driven by anger over the opposition's blocking of key legislation.</p>

A key lawsuit questions the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose duties on various countries, a power central to Trump's recent trade deals. A lower court already ruled against the administration, and while that decision is paused, the case's progression to the appeals court puts the legality of Trump's major trade actions at risk.

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the country is grappling with deteriorating conditions. The junta, led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, has overseen a crackdown on media and civil society, leading to job losses and human rights abuses, according to analysts and rights groups. Despite initial justifications of improving security and the economy, many Nigeriens find life more difficult.

Research shows that one in five teenagers feels lonely, and sociologists warn this can make young people more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. The problem is not confined to the young, with studies also highlighting loneliness in middle-aged individuals due to unemployment and in rural residents with fewer opportunities for social interaction.</p>

Unlike winter SAD, the summer version is less understood, but its prevalence is a growing concern as people face a choice between dangerous heat or isolation.</p>
