          <h2>Trump Administration Considers 'Baby Bonus' to Boost Birth Rates</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring proposals, including a potential $5,000 'baby bonus' for new mothers, aimed at incentivizing marriage and childbirth amid declining birth rates. While President Trump expressed interest in the idea, White House officials cautioned that no final decisions have been made. Vice President Vance has also advocated for expanding the child tax credit. Some organizations, like MomsRising, criticize the proposals as inadequate, arguing that affordable childcare, healthcare, and paid family leave would be more effective in supporting families.

          <p>Consumer spending in early April has increased by 3.8% year-over-year, as Americans accelerate purchases in anticipation of President Trump's tariff plan, according to JPMorgan data. This rise is primarily driven by discretionary spending, with consumers buying big-ticket items to avoid higher prices.

          <p>President Trump's call for automakers to relocate vehicle production to the U.S. faces challenges, including high costs and lengthy construction timelines. While an extension of tariff relief would be helpful, automakers and suppliers cannot simply 'move' plants quickly, as relocation requires years of planning, construction, and supply chain establishment. The construction of a new assembly plant can take years, and even smaller supplier plants require significant time and resources.
