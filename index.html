            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has decided to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes as the PBOC focuses on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States, particularly new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite this external pressure, China's economy has shown resilience, with first-quarter GDP growing at 5.4% year on year, allowing the central bank to maintain steady rates.

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan has sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a controversial site viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism, as the shrine began its three-day spring festival. While Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine personally due to diplomatic considerations amid improving ties with China and South Korea, this action still draws attention given the shrine honors wartime leaders convicted as war criminals. The move reflects a delicate balancing act between domestic tradition and international relations, particularly as this year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

            <p>Season two of The Last of Us is being criticized for its plot detours. The show has become a punishing watch, without the first season’s elegant insights. Season 2, though, is about how bonds can fracture. Instead of a careful observation of animosity, what the show presents are examples of undiluted pain. It posits that all of the characters have gotten lost in the darkness.</p>

            <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has been linked to a second group chat about sensitive military operations, which he reportedly shared with his wife, brother and personal lawyer. The messages sent via the Signal messaging app are again understood to have contained details of an attack on Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis in March. Democratic politicians have repeatedly called for Mr Hegseth to step down, but the White House has consistently defended Mr Hegseth.</p>

A Lifetime ISA offers 25% bonuses for savings, while some lenders offer mortgages with minimal deposits, like £5,000, and schemes like shared ownership allow buyers to purchase a share of a property.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Men are less likely to visit the GP compared to women, often delaying medical attention until symptoms become severe, influenced by societal pressures to "tough it out" and perceived vulnerability. Data indicates men are less registered at dental practices, use pharmacies less, and make fewer hospital outpatient appointments. This behavior contributes to poorer health outcomes, with men often self-managing conditions or prioritizing work patterns over healthcare. Experts suggest addressing these issues through redesigned services catering to men's needs and promoting open communication about health concerns.</p>
