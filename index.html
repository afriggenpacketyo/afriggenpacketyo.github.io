          <p>One year after endorsing Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, Elon Musk's political trajectory has been tumultuous. Initially a key advisor who established a government efficiency task force, his relationship with the administration soured over economic policies, leading to a public falling out. Despite his exit from Trump's inner circle and a decline in public favorability, Musk remains an influential figure due to his vast wealth and business empire. The article details his journey from a presidential ally to a critic, now exploring the formation of a new political party.</p>

The budget also earmarks approximately 35% of its funds for climate and biodiversity projects. This proposal must now undergo review and approval by the European Parliament and member states.

          <p>A 28-year-old golfer, Simon John Mariani, has died after being struck by lightning during a golf competition in Hamburg, New Jersey. The incident occurred on July 8 at the Ballyowen Golf Course, where Mariani was hit by a bolt on the 15th hole. Despite immediate efforts by his father and other golfers to provide CPR before paramedics arrived, he passed away on Monday. Mariani was an associate at a New York City health partners firm and is remembered by his family as driven and dedicated.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked a group of House Republicans for their opinion on whether he should fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with sources indicating he may proceed. The move, which is legally contentious as a Fed chair can only be dismissed "for cause," could destabilize financial markets. Trump's dissatisfaction stems from his belief that the Fed is not cutting interest rates fast enough, publicly criticizing Powell's performance and personality. This escalation of pressure comes amid ongoing debates about the Federal Reserve's independence from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly rebuked a segment of his own supporters who are demanding the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling them "weaklings." In a social media post, Trump expressed frustration that this group is focused on what he termed the "Jeffrey Epstein Hoax" instead of his administration's successes. This criticism highlights a growing rift within his base, as some prominent backers believe the government is hiding information about the late financier's powerful connections. Trump's sharp comments indicate an effort to quell the conspiracy theories surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>A major review has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed an opportunity to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who later murdered three children in Southport. Lord David Anderson KC reported that although teachers referred Rudakubana three times due to his obsession with violence, his case was closed each time because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review calls for the program to address individuals fascinated with extreme violence, even without a clear ideological motive. It also recommends more proactive monitoring of public social media to identify future attackers and prevent similar tragedies.</p>

Paxton's office asserts that these dyes are linked to negative health outcomes, contradicting the company's statements about their safety.

          <h2>California Governor Gavin Newsom Threatens Retaliation Over Texas Redistricting Plans</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that his state will not "stand idly by" if Texas Republicans proceed with redrawing congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The move in Texas, supported by President Trump, is seen as an attempt to increase the GOP's House majority. Newsom suggested that California Democrats, who hold a super-majority, could retaliate by undoing the state's independent redistricting commission and creating their own gerrymandered maps. However, legal experts note that California's constitution makes such a move extremely difficult, rendering Newsom's threat largely symbolic.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark's participation in the upcoming WNBA All-Star weekend is uncertain after she suffered a right groin injury during a game against the Connecticut Sun. Clark, who was set to be a team captain for the All-Star Game in her home arena, exited the game in visible pain. This is the latest in a series of leg injuries for the rookie sensation this season, who had never missed a game due to injury in her college or professional career before this year. Her status is pending further evaluation, casting a shadow over the highly anticipated event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In its latest annual defense white paper, Japan has used significantly sharper language to describe China, calling it an "unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge." The document highlights Beijing's expanding and increasingly assertive military activities as a cause of grave concern for Japan's security. The report points to a series of risky encounters between Chinese and Japanese forces over the past year, as well as growing military cooperation between China, Russia, and North Korea. This assessment reflects a heightened sense of threat in Tokyo and reinforces Japan's commitment to increasing its defense spending.</p>

          <h2>Review Recommends Renaming UK Physician Associates to 'Assistants' to Avoid Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 10:02:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to clarify their roles and prevent confusion with doctors. The review, prompted by safety concerns and a lack of clarity, also suggests standardized uniforms and limiting PAs to seeing pre-triaged patients with minor ailments. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has accepted all recommendations, emphasizing that assistants should support, not replace, doctors. The move aims to address concerns from the public and medical professionals about the growing use of these roles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Supported by the Trump administration and crypto advocates, the bill is part of a larger push to foster innovation in the digital currency sector while ensuring stability and mitigating risks for investors.

          <p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is under fire for funding new, multi-million dollar experiments on dogs, despite a recent announcement to reduce animal testing. An animal rights group uncovered that the NIH approved new grants for toxicology and cocaine studies on beagles since pledging to prioritize human-based research methods in April. While an acting NIH deputy director has called dog and cat tests "unconscionable" and vowed to phase them out, critics argue the agency's actions do not match its rhetoric. The NIH maintains it is shifting toward human-focused research but is legally constrained on existing grants.</p>

          <p>Oakmont Country Club has banned former U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark from its property after he damaged lockers in a fit of anger during this year's tournament. The prestigious Pittsburgh club has mandated that Clark must undergo anger management counseling and repay damages to be considered for reinstatement. This unprecedented disciplinary action against a player of Clark's stature follows previous incidents of on-course temper tantrums. In a statement, Clark expressed deep regret for his actions but also a desire to move on, a sentiment Oakmont is clearly not yet ready to share.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military conducted airstrikes in downtown Damascus, targeting Syria's military headquarters and another military site near the presidential palace. Israel's Defense Minister stated that "the painful strikes have begun," while Syria's Health Ministry reported one death and 28 injuries from the attack. The strikes escalate ongoing tensions in the region, particularly in southwest Syria, where Israel had previously conducted strikes to protect the minority Druze community from clashes involving the Syrian military. U.S. officials had called for de-escalation in the area just before the Damascus strikes occurred.</p>
