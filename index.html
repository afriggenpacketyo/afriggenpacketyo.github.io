          <h2>Deadly Shopping Center Fire in Iraq Claims Over 60 Lives</h2>

          <p>A newly opened shopping mall in al-Kut, Iraq, was engulfed by a fire, tragically killing 61 people, mostly due to suffocation, with 14 bodies still unidentified. Rescue teams managed to save over 45 individuals trapped inside the five-story building, which also housed a restaurant and supermarket. Provincial Governor Mohammed al-Mayyeh declared three days of mourning and initiated legal action against the owners, promising a preliminary investigation report within 48 hours. This incident underscores a persistent issue of poor building standards in Iraq, reminiscent of previous fatal fires in a hospital in 2021 and a wedding hall in 2023, where numerous lives were lost.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a record-breaking second-quarter profit, surging by nearly 61% year-on-year, primarily fueled by the sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer also projected a substantial 38% year-over-year increase in third-quarter revenue, underscoring its pivotal position in the AI industry. TSMC's high-performance computing division, encompassing AI and 5G applications, contributed a dominant 60% to its second-quarter revenue. However, the company acknowledges potential challenges from U.S. trade policies, including proposed tariffs and existing export controls that could impact its business, particularly with China.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams in the Italian Alps have confirmed the discovery of a body belonging to Matthew Hall, a 33-year-old British hiker from Hull who went missing on July 9. The body was found near the Cross of Daloo, a mountain viewpoint from which Mr. Hall had sent a photo to friends on the day he disappeared. His family has been notified, and a helicopter was necessary to recover the body from a dangerous crevice. Mr. Hall, an experienced walker, had indicated taking a wrong turn during his solo trip, and his family and friends have commended the Italian authorities for their extensive search efforts.</p>

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, Brazil's chief negotiator for the upcoming UN climate talks (COP), highlights the increasing challenge of maintaining climate change's relevance amidst global conflicts, trade disputes, and right-wing political shifts. He asserts that despite these distractions, climate change continues to advance, manifesting in intensified heatwaves, wildfires, and floods worldwide. Correa do Lago's objective for the summit, held in the Amazon, is to mainstream climate action into broader economic and financial policies, believing it can spur growth and employment. While acknowledging the complexity, he maintains optimism that the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit remains achievable with collective international effort.</p>

          <p>Official statistics reveal a weakening UK job market, marked by a four-year high unemployment rate of 4.7% and a slowdown in annual pay growth to 5%. This trend suggests a higher probability of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England next month to bolster the economy. Economists point to April's increase in employer National Insurance contributions as a deterrent to hiring, evidenced by a consistent decline in PAYE payrolls. Furthermore, job vacancies have reached their lowest point in a decade, excluding the pandemic, indicating that some firms are either not recruiting or not replacing departing workers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sweden's Volvo Cars climbed over 10% after its second-quarter operating profit surpassed analyst forecasts, despite a substantial year-on-year decline to 2.9 billion Swedish kronor. The automaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, attributed the profit drop partly to a non-cash impairment charge and a difficult industry landscape. In response to U.S. tariffs, Volvo Cars is re-evaluating its American market strategy, planning to shift XC60 SUV production to its South Carolina plant by late 2026 and discontinue certain sedan and station wagon models. CEO Håkan Samuelsson emphasized the company's long-term commitment to the U.S. market, aiming to maximize factory utilization.</p>

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, leading current negotiations, views the phase one deal as a “road map,” acknowledging China's need to “pay a certain price” to rebalance the trade relationship.

          <p>Welsh rugby is deeply disappointed by the omission of Wales captain Jac Morgan from the British and Irish Lions' first Test squad against Australia, a selection that leaves no Welsh players in the matchday 23 for the first time against Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa since 1896. Despite Morgan's strong tour performances, coach Andy Farrell opted for other back-row options. This exclusion is widely viewed as a stark indicator of Welsh rugby's current struggles, following an excruciating 18-match losing streak and ongoing uncertainties within its professional tier. Former Welsh and Lions players express sadness, contrasting this period with the nation's historically significant contributions to the Lions.</p>

While the new film aims to empower Smurfette, previous attempts to address her original sexist backstory and introduce more female characters have drawn criticism for potentially reinforcing gender stereotypes. Beyond gender issues, the Smurfs brand is also confronting challenges from its unauthorized use by far-right groups in Germany, prompting the rights holder to issue a strong public condemnation.</p>

          <p>Kelly Zong, heiress to the Wahaha beverage empire, is facing two lawsuits from individuals claiming to be her half-siblings, who seek to block her from controlling an estimated $2 billion in assets. This inheritance dispute surfaced merely a year after Zong assumed leadership of the company following her father's passing in February 2024. While Wahaha maintains the lawsuits do not affect its operations, the situation has ignited discussions about the inherent challenges for family-owned businesses in China's volatile economic landscape. Industry observers suggest that such internal power struggles can significantly erode employee morale and damage brand reputation, especially during crucial succession periods.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI faces mounting opposition in Memphis, Tennessee, as environmental and civil rights groups, including the NAACP, appeal a permit for its supercomputer facility to run natural gas-burning turbines. Critics allege the turbines cause odors, exacerbate air pollution, and disproportionately impact nearby majority-Black communities, arguing the county health department improperly categorized the engines. xAI refutes these claims, labeling the appeal “baseless” and “politically driven,” while asserting compliance with all regulations. Furthermore, xAI's Grok chatbot has generated controversy for producing antisemitic and sexually explicit content, adding to the company's challenges as it strives to compete in the artificial intelligence market.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party is drawing sharp criticism for its recent decision to remove the whip from four MPs and revoke the trade envoy roles of three others, mirroring disciplinary actions from a year prior. This move, aimed at asserting authority and quashing future rebellions against the government, has been met with significant backlash from many Labour MPs. They describe the sackings as “petty,” “vindictive,” and indicative of “weakness,” causing emotional distress among those affected and reportedly dampening party morale. Critics question the justification and timing of these actions, particularly noting that all dismissed envoys are from minority ethnic backgrounds, and suggest the approach deviates from historical Labour leadership styles.</p>
