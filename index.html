          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist backed by Donald Trump, has won the Polish presidency in a close election against Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory poses a challenge to the current pro-EU government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, potentially disrupting Poland's relationship with Brussels and Kyiv. As president, Nawrocki holds veto power over legislation, which he is expected to use to impede Tusk's pro-EU reforms, including the disbursement of 137 billion euros in EU funds that were previously frozen due to rule-of-law concerns. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland despite the election outcome. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations have reconvened in Istanbul for U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at resolving the three-year conflict. The talks occur amidst heightened tensions, following a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Ukraine is advocating for a full 30-day ceasefire to facilitate negotiations, but Russia has rejected this request, maintaining maximalist war goals, including the annexation of Ukrainian regions and a ban on Ukraine's NATO accession. Despite the ongoing negotiations, both sides continue to engage in military actions, with Russia launching drone and missile attacks across Ukraine and Ukraine targeting Russian military assets. </p>

          <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a personal trainer, has been sentenced to 14 months in a young offender institution for causing a pile-up of police cars while fleeing from officers after a first date. Azarbonyad, driving with his date in the passenger seat, reached speeds of up to 120 mph on the A1 near Newcastle, injuring seven officers and damaging five police cars. He had previously admitted to dangerous driving and driving while banned, claiming he panicked because his passenger had drugs on her. The judge noted Azarbonyad's deliberate decision to flee and the miraculous absence of fatalities, also imposing a three-year driving ban. </p>

          <p>European Union member states are expected to vote on restricting access to the bloc's procurement markets for Chinese medical device manufacturers, responding to China's limited market access for EU firms. The European Commission investigation found clear evidence of China unfairly limiting access for EU medical device producers to government contracts, particularly through "Buy China" policies. This action marks the first use of the bloc’s international procurement instrument (IPI) and aims to address trade imbalances in the medical device sector. The vote comes ahead of a meeting between EU and Chinese trade chiefs, potentially adding tension to ongoing trade discussions. </p>

          <p>Japan's revenue from its departure tax on travelers has reached a record high in fiscal year 2024, driven by a surge in international visitors. The International Tourist Tax, levied at 1,000 yen per departing traveler, has already generated 48.1 billion yen, surpassing the previous record from fiscal 2019. The increase in tourism is attributed to a weaker yen and more available flights, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has suggested potentially increasing the departure tax to further promote tourism and address overcrowding at popular sites. </p>
