          <p>Over 260 firefighters are combating a deadly wildfire near Athens, which has already claimed one life and destroyed homes and farmland in the Keratea region. The blaze, fueled by gale-force winds, has prompted evacuations as authorities work to contain its spread. This event is part of a series of wildfires across Greece and neighboring Turkey, where the Dardanelles Strait was temporarily closed. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and destructiveness of these fires to climate change, intensifying pressure on Mediterranean nations to improve firefighting collaboration and technology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As conflicts drive catastrophic hunger in places like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are highlighting the dangers of "refeeding syndrome," a potentially fatal condition that can occur when malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly. The body's metabolism slows dramatically during starvation, and a sudden influx of nutrients can cause severe electrolyte imbalances, leading to critical organ failure. Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods to stabilize patients and prevent this syndrome. Experts stress that safe, managed access for aid agencies is crucial to prevent further deaths.</p>

          <p>Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan immigrant and accountant who has lived in Michigan for over 16 years, has decided to self-deport rather than face potential detention under the Trump administration's immigration policies. Despite having a U.S. citizen wife and three children, a past immigration case has left him deportable, though he has no criminal record. Fearing a forceful removal, Kangethe chose to leave on his own terms, a decision that has devastated his family and community. His story highlights the personal toll of current immigration enforcement, which has prompted many undocumented individuals to voluntarily leave the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes recent statements from Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has publicly criticized her own party and prominent conservative media outlets like Fox News. Greene has voiced frustration with the treatment of women within the GOP and has become the first Republican lawmaker to label the situation in Gaza a genocide. The author suggests that while Greene's motivations may be complex and not aligned with progressive causes, her actions are sowing significant discord within the Republican party. This infighting, the article argues, may ultimately be more damaging to the MAGA movement than any opposition from Democrats.</p>

This decision would remove the only widely available COVID vaccine for this age group from the market, creating a potential gap in protection. The CDC is reportedly in discussions with Moderna to increase its supply for young children, but Moderna's pediatric shot is currently only approved for children with underlying health conditions. Public health experts have expressed concern over the timing and potential impact on vaccination access for kids.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. If completed, it would be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, with an estimated cost of €13.5 billion. The project, first approved in 1971, has faced numerous cancellations over financial and practical concerns, including its location in a seismically active area. Proponents highlight the potential for economic prosperity and job creation, while opponents argue the funds should be redirected to existing infrastructure needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The implementation of President Trump's widespread tariffs is expected to have significant consequences for the U.S. economy and consumers. Economists anticipate that the costs will lead to higher prices for goods, with some projections suggesting price hikes of up to 39% for items like shoes. While companies have absorbed some initial costs, these expenses will likely be passed on to shoppers, potentially raising the average household's annual costs by $2,400. The tariffs are also projected to slow hiring, weaken the job market, and increase overall inflation, though most forecasters do not currently predict a full recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The term "grifter" has seen a dramatic rise in usage as a political insult, more than doubling since 2017 according to the Oxford English Dictionary. This article explores why the accusation of being a swindler who profits from bad-faith opinions has become so common in public discourse. The analysis links its popularity to the rise of influencer culture, high-profile scam documentaries, and a general decline in public trust in politicians. The term is now frequently used across the political spectrum to question the motives and authenticity of opponents, reflecting a broader atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Mayor Shiro Suzuki delivered a solemn appeal for an end to global conflicts. In his Peace Declaration, he warned that the world's current trajectory of confrontation could lead to nuclear war. The 1945 attack killed an estimated 74,000 people and caused long-term suffering from radiation effects for survivors. The ceremony included a moment of silence and symbolic water offerings to honor the victims, serving as a powerful reminder of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons and a call for international peace.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has expanded rapidly from 30 to nearly 5,400 acres, forcing evacuation orders for thousands of residents near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, the blaze injured one firefighter whose truck overturned while battling the flames. Although favorable weather has recently allowed for partial containment, authorities are urging residents to remain on high alert as high temperatures are forecast to continue. The event is one of several active wildfires currently burning across the state.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two future Hall of Fame pitchers, Clayton Kershaw and the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays 5-1. Both veterans delivered strong performances, each pitching six innings in a duel that evoked their long and storied careers. Kershaw allowed just one run, outdueling Scherzer who gave up two, including a decisive two-run homer to Mookie Betts. The game was a nostalgic showcase of two of the sport's most dominant pitchers of their generation, both of whom continue to compete at a high level for first-place teams.</p>

          <p>One year after a catastrophic landfill avalanche in Kiteezi, Uganda, killed 34 people and left over 220 homeless, victims are still awaiting compensation and living in fear. The disaster highlighted the urgent waste management crisis in the capital, Kampala, which produces 2,000 tonnes of garbage daily. The city has since closed the Kiteezi landfill and acquired new land for waste disposal, but this move is mired in controversy over its location within a protected forest reserve. Despite plans for modern recycling and composting facilities, a lack of funding and ongoing legal battles have stalled progress.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude oil, raising questions about the future of EU-India relations. However, experts believe this move is largely symbolic and will not derail progress on a long-delayed free trade agreement between the two powers. The article suggests that the more significant pressure on India comes from the United States and the threat of high tariffs from the Trump administration. This dynamic may paradoxically push India to seek a more stable and predictable economic partnership with the EU, potentially accelerating trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Reform of UK Civil Service Internship Program Divides Student Opinion</h2>

          <p>A UK government reform restricting a competitive civil service summer internship to applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds has sparked debate among students. The change aims to make the civil service more representative, with some students from working-class families saying it gives them a fair chance. However, other students, who also consider themselves working-class but do not meet the specific parental occupation criteria, feel unfairly excluded from a key pathway into a public service career. The article highlights the personal reactions of four students, illustrating the complex and divisive nature of the new social mobility policy.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created a pure, large hexagonal diamond in a laboratory, a breakthrough for a material previously found only in meteorite craters. This rare form of diamond, known as lonsdaleite, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to be significantly harder. Published in the journal Nature, the research details the synthesis of high-purity hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size. This achievement provides definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and could pave the way for new ultra-hard industrial applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) remained unchanged in July compared to the previous year, indicating persistent weak domestic demand within the world's second-largest economy. This flat reading narrowly avoided a decline, while the producer price index (PPI) continued to show deflation, signaling ongoing challenges for manufacturers. Although the CPI rose slightly from the previous month, the overall data reflects an economy struggling with trade turbulence and insufficient consumer spending. The figures show a 1.6% drop in food prices, while service prices saw a modest 0.5% increase year-on-year. (not investment advice)</p>
