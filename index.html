          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, signaling widespread investor anxiety. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's KOSPI indexes saw substantial losses, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also plummeted. The market turmoil reflects concerns over potential inflation and a possible recession triggered by the trade war. These tariffs, impacting numerous countries, raise fears of economic slowdown and have led to revised recession forecasts from major financial institutions. (not investment advice)

          <p>China has responded forcefully to President Trump's latest tariffs, increasing the likelihood of an intense trade war between the two economic giants. Beijing has levied retaliatory tariffs on all U.S. goods and signaled a shift away from trade negotiations. This aggressive stance includes export curbs on rare earth elements and restrictions on U.S. firms operating in China. Analysts predict further rounds of tariffs from the U.S., potentially leading to a decoupling of commercial ties and a significant slowdown in China's economy. (not investment advice)

          <p>The UK government has relaxed rules for car manufacturers regarding electric vehicle (EV) sales targets in response to recent tariffs imposed by the US. While a ban on new petrol and diesel car production remains in effect for 2030, manufacturers will now have greater flexibility and lower fines. Prime Minister Starmer highlighted government support for EV purchases and charging infrastructure improvements. However, opposition parties criticize the measures as insufficient to protect the car industry from the impact of Trump's tariffs. (not investment advice)

          <p>Asian stock markets have plummeted as the shockwaves from US President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to reverberate around the world. The region is particularly sensitive to the impact of fears that a global trade war could trigger a slowdown or even a recession in the world's biggest economy. As a region that manufactures so many of the goods sold globally, Asian countries and territories are being hit directly by the tariffs. Goldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the US will fall into recession in the next 12 months. (not investment advice)

          <p>Despite rising trade tensions and the impact of U.S. tariffs, China's central bank is prioritizing stability over devaluation for the yuan. The People's Bank of China has set the yuan's daily reference rate to a four-month low against the US dollar, but has not breached the 7.2 benchmark. This move signals an intention to stabilize the yuan rather than devalue it to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)
