          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle is intensifying in the Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect, the storm's center is projected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday. The National Hurricane Center has warned that swells generated by Gabrielle are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Canada. Forecasters anticipate the storm could reach hurricane strength within the next day or two.</p>

          <p>During a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prominent figures delivered impassioned speeches reflecting on his legacy and the current political climate. Tucker Carlson described Kirk as fearless and focused on "bringing the gospel to the country."

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move aimed at boosting economic growth. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the government hails the decision as a "no-brainer for growth," the expansion faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise and pollution.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) by pregnant women and an increased risk of autism in their children. This move directly contradicts current medical guidelines, which consider the pain reliever safe for use during pregnancy. The announcement is also expected to include an initiative to explore the drug leucovorin as a potential treatment for autism. This development follows President Trump's public statement promising a "very important announcement" on the topic.</p>

With seconds remaining, the Rams attempted a 44-yard game-winning field goal, but it was blocked by the Eagles' defense. Defensive lineman Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball and ran it back for the decisive score, capping a remarkable comeback victory for Philadelphia. The Eagles overcame a 19-point deficit in the second half to remain undefeated for the season.</p>

          <p>A 3-year-old mountain lion, known to researchers as F390, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in Orange County. Her death leaves her two 14-month-old cubs orphaned at a critical time in their development when they are still learning to hunt and survive independently. The UC Davis California Carnivores Program, which had been tracking the mother via a GPS collar, highlighted the incident as an example of the severe threat that roadways pose to wildlife in fragmented habitats. Researchers have since managed to collar one of the cubs to monitor her progress.</p>

A Taliban spokesman emphasized that Afghanistan's territorial integrity is of utmost importance and cited the Doha Agreement, in which the U.S. pledged not to threaten the country's independence. Trump had stated that he was in discussions to get the base back, which the U.S. controlled for nearly two decades before its withdrawal in 2021, and warned of "bad things" if his demand was not met.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has strongly condemned public comments made by Charles Kushner, the U.S. Ambassador to France, regarding the country's handling of antisemitism. Macron labeled the ambassador's criticism, which linked French foreign policy to the safety of its Jewish citizens, as an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat." The dispute highlights significant diplomatic tension between the two allies, particularly over France's recent decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting the 'Muse' software from Collins Aerospace has led to major disruptions at several European airports, including London Heathrow and Brussels. The software, used by multiple airlines for check-in and baggage handling, was knocked offline, forcing airport staff to resort to manual, paper-based systems. This resulted in hundreds of flight delays and long queues for travelers, with officials at Brussels Airport asking airlines to cancel half of their Monday departures as the issue persists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2003, Great Britain's athletics team has concluded a World Championships without winning a single gold medal. The team secured a total of five medals in Tokyo, their joint-lowest tally since 2005, finishing 21st in the overall medal table. The disappointing performance was attributed to a combination of injuries to key athletes like Josh Kerr and Matthew Hudson-Smith, missed opportunities, and the failure of any relay teams to reach the podium, which has historically been a strength for Team GB.</p>

          <p>Remarkable footage shared by the Amur Tiger Center in Russia captures the raw power of two massive tigers being released back into their natural habitat. The video shows the sibling tigers, a male and a female, snarling and aggressively swatting at their cage doors as they are opened, demonstrating their wild instincts before they bolt into the forest. Amur tigers are the largest tiger subspecies and are endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting their populations in eastern Russia and northeastern China.</p>

          <p>U.S. athlete Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000-meter final at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with an astonishing finishing kick. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but unleashed a powerful surge to overtake the field and secure the victory. He described the win as a moment of vindication, as he had been controversially disqualified from the 1,500-meter event earlier in the competition and wanted to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>Luke Donald, the captain for Team Europe, has raised the possibility that the American Ryder Cup team could face a hostile home crowd at Bethpage. He suggested that because the U.S. players are receiving a $500,000 payment to participate—a first for the event—the New York fans, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on them if they don't perform well. In contrast, the European team continues to play without payment, a tradition Donald says his players strongly support to uphold the spirit of the competition.</p>

          <p>To combat production quality issues seen elsewhere in the aviation industry, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet employs advanced "smart factory" technology. A recent study reveals the use of a unified network combining 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, sensor, robot, and worker on the final assembly line. This integrated system creates a sensing-transmission-control loop designed to eliminate errors, such as missing bolts or misplaced tools, that might be overlooked in manual checks.</p>
