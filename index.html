        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following public pressure and media reports, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move comes after a Wall Street Journal article detailed a letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has dismissed. Despite the announcement, some Democratic lawmakers express skepticism, arguing that grand jury testimony is insufficient and that other evidence like videos and interview notes should also be released. The administration faces ongoing scrutiny over its handling of the Epstein files from political opponents and some supporters.</p>

          <p>A report from Beijing's National Economic Research Institute reveals that China's marketization index, a measure of market-based resource allocation, declined in 2023. The overall score fell to 5.62 out of 10, with the most significant drop observed in the subindex for government-market relations, indicating increased state intervention. In response, prominent Chinese economists are urging the government to implement more robust pro-market reforms to address economic imbalances and intense intra-industry competition. They warn that reversing this trend is crucial for the nation's economic health and stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:35:24 EDT</div>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after a security incident at Vancouver's airport. Authorities state he seized control of a Cessna aircraft by threatening a flight instructor, prompting NORAD to scramble fighter jets before the plane landed safely. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police believe the act was driven by an ideological motive related to climate change, as social media posts by a man with the same name identify him as a messianic figure sent to save humanity. Former employers described Cassim as an intelligent pilot who later developed a belief that the world was ending.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The moderation was partly due to easing rice prices after the government released stockpiles, although inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Despite the cooling inflation, economists express concern over persistent price pressures and external risks, such as potential U.S. tariffs, which could hinder future growth. The economic uncertainty comes as the country heads into an Upper House election. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article questions the official reason for ending 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,' which CBS stated was a 'purely a financial decision.' The author argues the move appears to be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Trump by CBS's parent company, Paramount, which is awaiting federal approval for a merger with Skydance. The piece highlights a series of events, including a controversial $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Trump and the departure of the '60 Minutes' chief, suggesting a potential erosion of the network's editorial independence. It contrasts Colbert's high ratings with the network's claim of financial necessity.</p>

The report cited a 2003 birthday letter, allegedly from Trump to Epstein, that was examined during a past investigation and reportedly contained a joking reference to 'secrets.' Trump vehemently denied the letter's authenticity on social media, calling it a 'FAKE' and stating that the newspaper was warned against publishing the 'false, malicious, and defamatory' story.

Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is 'questioning everything TSA does' and that the size limitations for liquids could be the 'next big announcement.' This follows the recent, immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. The current rule, in place since a foiled 2006 terror plot, limits liquids to containers of 3.4 ounces or less, a regulation that could be altered by new 3-D scanning technology.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties set aside political divisions to play together in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game. The event, which pits 'Team Congress' against a team of female journalists, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million to date. Participants and attendees emphasize the importance of coming together for a common cause, offering a rare moment of unity in Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a broad overview of the impact of intensified immigration raids across Southern California, which have instilled widespread fear and altered community life. The crackdown has led many undocumented residents, who number an estimated 1.4 million in the region, into hiding, afraid to work or go to school. This has resulted in shuttered businesses and canceled public events. The administration highlights the arrest of individuals with serious criminal records, including for sexual assault, but activists argue the operations terrorize communities and sweep up many non-criminals, creating a climate of chaos and distrust.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey are preparing to melt sections of a 1.5-million-year-old ice core, the oldest ever retrieved, to study Earth's past climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that provide a detailed record of historical atmospheric conditions. Researchers hope the data will help them understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles that occurred around one million years ago. This analysis could 'revolutionize' knowledge of climate change and improve predictions about our planet's future response to rising greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>New UK regulations taking effect next July will require 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt by using these currently unregulated interest-free credit services. As a result, some shoppers may be denied this form of credit. The new rules will also grant consumers the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and provide clearer information on fees and cancellation rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted five individuals in Louisiana, including three current and former police chiefs, for allegedly running a visa fraud scheme. The 62-count indictment claims the defendants created and authenticated false police reports depicting immigrants as victims of fabricated crimes. These bogus reports were then used by the immigrants to apply for U-visas, which are reserved for victims of certain crimes who assist law enforcement. Prosecutors allege a local businessman paid the law enforcement officials $5,000 for each fraudulent report, enabling a conspiracy that undermined the integrity of the visa program.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign vein condition. The disclosure came after days of public speculation fueled by photographs showing swelling in the president's legs and bruising on his hand. A presidential physician stated the condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart and is common in people over 70. The White House also attributed the hand bruising to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, asserting that the president remains in 'excellent health' overall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis from the BBC's Chris Mason explains why the UK Labour Party had little choice but to suspend MP Diane Abbott again. The author argues that because Abbott stated she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her initial suspension, the party had to act consistently to maintain its strong stance against antisemitism. This position is crucial for leader Keir Starmer, who has worked to distance the party from the antisemitism controversies of the Jeremy Corbyn era. By doubling down on her original remarks, Abbott effectively forced the party's hand, leading to her second suspension.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it will cancel 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' in May 2026, ending the franchise that began with David Letterman in 1993. The network cited the decision as 'purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,' pointing to declining advertising revenue as audiences shift to short-form online content. Despite being the top-rated broadcast late-night show for nine seasons, the program was reportedly losing money. The move underscores the immense pressure on traditional media as parent company Paramount awaits federal approval for its sale to Skydance Media.</p>
