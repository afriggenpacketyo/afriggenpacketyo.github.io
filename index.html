          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and 30 other jurisdictions. The ruling pertains to cities and counties with 'sanctuary' policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders an unconstitutional 'coercive threat,' extending a previous order that protected other cities. This legal challenge underscores ongoing tensions between federal and local governments over immigration enforcement and local autonomy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 2-1 to the San Diego Padres, resulting in a tie for first place in the National League West. This setback follows a week where the Dodgers squandered momentum, splitting a series with the Colorado Rockies after previously sweeping the Padres. Despite a strong pitching performance from Blake Snell, the Dodgers' offense struggled, failing to capitalize on late-game opportunities. The loss highlights a disappointing trend for the team, leaving them on an unstable footing after a period of expected dominance in the rivalry.</p>

          <p>The United States is monitoring the presence of five Chinese icebreakers and research vessels in the Arctic Ocean, raising concerns about China's intensifying interest in the region. The fleet recently passed through the Bering Strait, with some vessels reportedly nearing the Alaskan coast within a disputed continental shelf area. Over the past five years, one of China's icebreakers, the Xue Long 2, has conducted numerous scientific expeditions to both polar regions. This increased activity signals China's growing strategic and scientific ambitions in the Arctic, prompting unease from the US.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez was denied parole by the California board, just one day after his brother Erik faced a similar rejection, keeping both in prison after more than three decades. The panel cited the brutal nature of their parents' 1989 murders, Lyle's lack of self-control, and ongoing 'anti-social personality traits' like deception, despite acknowledging his genuine remorse and model inmate behavior. Both brothers, convicted for killing their parents, can reapply for parole in three years, but the decisions mark a significant setback in their quest for freedom.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has pledged mass deportations of asylum seekers arriving in the UK via small boats, citing national security threats and potential public disorder. His plan includes withdrawing Britain from the European Convention on Human Rights and detaining arrivals on disused RAF bases for return to their home countries. While Labour dismissed the proposals as 'pie in the sky,' Farage argues that swift detention and deportation would quickly deter future crossings. The government faces increasing pressure over record asylum applications, making immigration a central issue in UK politics.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has implemented a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, aiming to retain these critical raw materials for investment in its downstream industries.

Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capabilities give it a significant advantage, signaling its intent to prioritize national development and exercise geoeconomic agency.

She discussed her relationships with Epstein, former Presidents Trump and Clinton, and denied introducing Prince Andrew to an accuser, calling a famous photo 'fake.' The release aims to address pushback on the administration's handling of the Epstein fallout.</p>

          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at Smitty's Supply, an automotive supply company in Roseland, Louisiana, led to a mandatory evacuation for residents within a one-mile radius and a nearby elementary school. The incident sent large flames and thick black smoke billowing into the air, but officials reported no injuries. Emergency crews, including the DEQ and EPA, are on site, working to control the blaze and assess potential chemical risks, though the cause remains unknown. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged residents to follow local guidance as the situation unfolds.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at the home and office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton in Bethesda, Maryland, and Washington D.C., respectively, in connection with a classified documents investigation. President Trump claimed he learned of the raid from TV, while calling Bolton 'a lowlife' and 'unpatriotic.' FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media that 'NO ONE is above the law.' Bolton, who served in Trump's first term, previously wrote a critical memoir that the Trump administration tried to block, leading to a criminal inquiry over alleged classified information disclosure.</p>

          <p>Polling data suggests a growing political divide among young people in the UK, with young women increasingly leaning left and young men showing a greater propensity for right-wing parties like Reform UK. A 2025 survey indicated 20% of young women identify as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with the Green Party particularly popular among young women. Researchers attribute this gap to factors like higher education rates among women and the influence of social media. Some experts suggest young men may be clinging to traditional masculinity, while women seek progressive futures, contributing to this evolving political landscape.</p>

          <p>The release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts provided some relief for Donald Trump, as her statements largely downplayed his close association with Jeffrey Epstein, but failed to quell outrage among his supporters demanding more transparency. Maxwell stated she never saw Trump in 'any type of massage setting' or doing anything inappropriate, and didn't recall him contributing to Epstein's birthday book. The transcripts, which also heavily questioned Bill Clinton's connections, did not offer the definitive revelations many conspiracy theorists sought. Maxwell's move to a lower-security prison after the interview further fueled suspicion among some observers.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses an earlier stance that troops would not carry weapons during their mission. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force, lauded the mission as bringing 'total safety' to D.C. and considered expanding it to Chicago. However, Washington's Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson expressed grave concerns, calling the federal intervention 'uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound,' citing potential for increased tensions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro pledging aggressive prosecution. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers alone are poor indicators of public safety or crime reduction. They note that 'flooding the zone' with law enforcement can inflate arrest figures for minor offenses and may not lead to convictions. Experts also highlight the risk of increased police-public interactions leading to more uses of force. The lack of transparency regarding who was arrested further complicates assessing the mission's true impact.</p>

          <p>A Colorado judge rejected a plea agreement for funeral home owner Jon Hallford, who admitted to abusing 191 corpses, after emotional testimony from victims' families demanding a harsher sentence. Hallford and his wife, Carie, ran a fraudulent scheme, taking money for cremations but instead stashing bodies and providing families with concrete. The rejected deal would have allowed Hallford to serve a 20-year federal sentence concurrently with a state sentence, which families felt was insufficient.

          <p>President Trump's initiative to clear homeless encampments in Washington D.C. draws parallels to San Francisco's recent aggressive crackdown, prompting a sense of déjà vu for many. Following a Supreme Court ruling permitting citations for rough sleeping, San Francisco saw a dramatic reduction in visible encampments, though overall homelessness figures continued to rise. While some residents and businesses welcomed the changes, advocates for the unhoused criticize the criminalization of homelessness as punitive and ineffective. Trump's plan, like San Francisco's, aims to deter street living while promising shelter, but faces scrutiny over its human impact and long-term efficacy.</p>
