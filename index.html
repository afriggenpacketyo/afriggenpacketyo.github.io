          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before congressional committees to discuss budget cuts, department restructuring, and his stance on vaccines, facing criticism from Democratic representatives like Rosa DeLauro, who accused him of gutting life-saving programs. Kennedy defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate wasteful spending, despite concerns about layoffs affecting critical regulatory roles. He reaffirmed his support for vaccines but acknowledged ongoing CDC studies on potential links to autism, a stance that has drawn scrutiny given measles outbreaks across the U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy expressed that Kennedy assured him he would not alter vaccine policy without scientific evidence, highlighting the ongoing tension between Kennedy's statements and public health concerns.</p>

          <p>Apple is planning to significantly increase iPhone production in India, aiming for a majority of iPhones sold in the US to originate from there, with Vietnam producing iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods. This move is intended to mitigate the impact of US tariffs on Chinese imports. While this presents a significant opportunity for India's electronics manufacturing sector, challenges remain, including higher production costs compared to China and potential labor market rigidities. Experts emphasize the need for heavy investment in infrastructure, skills, and technology to support this transition, while also acknowledging potential complexities in Indo-China relations.</p>

          <p>Many girls in Sri Lanka's hill country are missing school due to period poverty, struggling to afford sanitary pads, with almost half of girls surveyed reporting they struggle to afford pads each month. A pack of sanitary napkins has nearly doubled in cost since the economic crisis in 2022, exacerbating the issue. The government's voucher program is insufficient, and some girls resort to using unsafe cloth pads, leading to infections.

          <p>A new analysis reveals that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of a basic standard of living is widening, with the bottom 60% of U.S. households unable to afford a "minimal quality of life." The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that these households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, need $67,000 to cover essential expenses. The cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for lower-income earners have fallen, raising concerns about social unrest and the unattainability of the American dream.</p>

          <p>Israel attempted to assassinate Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, though his fate remains unknown. If confirmed, his death would be a tactical victory for Israel, but its long-term significance is uncertain, as Hamas has historically survived the loss of leaders. Analysts suggest that while Sinwar's death would weaken the group, it might not alter Hamas's strategic outlook or soften Israel's approach to cease-fire negotiations. Some argue that Israel's insistence on continuing the war is a greater obstacle to peace than the leadership of Hamas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria has sparked hope for economic recovery after years of civil war. The move could allow for increased salaries, cheaper goods, and improved services, while also enabling reconstruction efforts. However, analysts caution that the impact may take time, and challenges remain in fully reintegrating Syria into the global economy. The decision is seen as a win for Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and a crucial step for the new Syrian government in reuniting the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to lower prescription drug prices have reignited the debate over high costs in the U.S. Americans pay significantly more for drugs than other high-income countries due to a complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. Pharmaceutical companies defend higher prices by citing research and development costs, while critics argue for greater transparency and negotiation power. While branded drugs are expensive, generic drugs are often cheaper in the U.S. compared to other nations.</p>
