          <p>Storm Amy, the first named storm of the season, has brought severe weather across the UK, with amber wind warnings in northern and western Scotland. The Met Office cautioned residents about potential power cuts, flying debris, and widespread travel disruptions, including suspended rail services and ferry cancellations. Tragically, one person died in the Republic of Ireland due to a weather-related incident. While Saturday is expected to remain very windy, the storm is forecast to gradually ease as it moves into the North Sea, with drier conditions anticipated by Sunday for the latter half of the weekend.</p>

          <p>The inaugural Riyadh Comedy Festival, featuring international comedians like Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr, has ignited controversy due to its explicit content and the backdrop of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. While local audiences embraced the uncensored humor, human rights organizations criticized participating artists for not addressing the kingdom's abuses, calling it a "whitewashing" effort. The article highlights that financial incentives often motivate comedians to perform, with some rejecting offers due to alleged content restrictions. This festival coincides with the seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi's murder, intensifying scrutiny of the event's broader ethical implications.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants, freezing a lower court's decision that deemed the termination illegal. This ruling allows the administration to proceed with rolling back protections that permitted Venezuelans to live and work in the U.S. without deportation threats. Dissenting justices criticized the decision as a misuse of the emergency docket, highlighting the potential for immense disruption and harm to hundreds of thousands of lives. The administration argues TPS was abused, while advocates emphasize the dangers of returning migrants to unsafe conditions.</p>

          <p>A white Kansas sheriff's deputy faces second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges following the death of Charles Adair, a cuffed Black man in custody. Newly released court records detail that the deputy pressed his knee into Adair's back for 86 seconds after he was returned to his cell, despite Adair having a severely infected leg. An autopsy concluded the cause of death was "mechanical asphyxia." The incident has provoked significant outrage and calls for the public release of body camera footage, with Adair's family attorney questioning the severe outcome for a man jailed over minor traffic violations.</p>

          <p>PPE Medpro, a company connected to Baroness Mone and her husband, has been ordered to repay £122 million to the Department of Health and Social Care for supplying substandard gowns. However, the company asserts that it transferred the majority of these funds to consortium partners and argues that administrators should pursue those entities for recovery. Baroness Mone controversially used her contacts to secure the "VIP lane" government contract. With PPE Medpro now entering administration and possessing minimal assets, the government faces significant hurdles in recouping the full amount, while the National Crime Agency continues its investigation into the accountability of all involved parties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to offer unaccompanied immigrant children, aged 14 and older, a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily depart the U.S., as revealed in a new memo. This policy, which excludes Mexican minors, represents a significant shift from traditional immigration protocols that typically involve legal counsel and judicial approval. Immigration lawyers and advocates have voiced strong concerns, arguing that incentivizing self-deportation exploits vulnerable children and pressures them to forgo their legal rights. Critics also fear it could lead to increased family separations and expose children to greater dangers upon their return to their home countries.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally agreed to significant portions of President Trump's proposed Gaza peace plan, notably consenting to release all remaining hostages and transfer the Strip's administration to an independent Palestinian body. This development, seen as a positive step by U.S. officials, still requires further negotiations on specific details, including the decommissioning of weapons. Following Hamas's statement, President Trump urged Israel to immediately cease bombing Gaza to ensure the safe and swift release of hostages. This marks a critical moment in efforts to de-escalate the conflict, though a comprehensive agreement remains to be finalized.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born in the U.S. to non-citizens, upholding lower court injunctions. This decision is a significant legal defeat for President Trump's executive order seeking to narrow birthright citizenship, a concept largely interpreted under the 14th Amendment. The court emphasized historical precedents and a need to be wary of breaking with established traditions. While state attorneys general and civil liberties advocates lauded the ruling, the White House announced its intention to appeal to the Supreme Court for a definitive constitutional determination on the matter.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second week following repeated failures by the Senate to pass either Democratic or Republican spending proposals. Both parties remain deeply entrenched over healthcare funding, with Democrats pushing to protect subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, while Republicans accuse them of attempting to fund healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The White House has threatened extensive layoffs of federal employees if the impasse persists, with President Trump specifically targeting "Democrat agencies." This ongoing stalemate underscores profound partisan divisions and is projected to incur substantial economic consequences, including rising unemployment across the nation.</p>

          <p>Omaha's police chief has addressed the widespread outrage surrounding the gunpoint stop of champion boxer Terence "Bud" Crawford, acknowledging the disproportionate rate at which Black individuals are subjected to such police encounters. Hours after a city celebration in his honor, Crawford, who is Black, was ordered from his car at gunpoint after officers observed his legally carried firearm. While an internal investigation found no policy violations, the incident has reignited deep-seated tensions between the Black community and the police. The chief, despite understanding the anger, stated that police video would not be released without Crawford's consent.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth abruptly fired Navy chief of staff Jon Harrison, a powerful aide who had implemented significant bureaucratic reshuffles within the service. This unexpected ouster follows the recent confirmation of Navy Undersecretary Hung Cao, a nominee of the Trump administration. Harrison, also a Trump appointee, had introduced changes aimed at diminishing the undersecretary's influence. This event is part of a broader pattern of substantial personnel changes within the Pentagon under the current administration, including the removal of other top aides and military leaders, reflecting a period of considerable turbulence for U.S. defense leadership.</p>

          <p>AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems has announced the withdrawal of its plans for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), just days after successfully securing over $1 billion in private funding at an $8.1 billion valuation. While no explicit reason was provided for the withdrawal, a company spokesperson suggested that the original prospectus, filed over a year ago, had become outdated due to the rapid advancements in the AI sector. The company, which had been preparing to challenge Nvidia, has strategically shifted its focus towards providing a cloud service. Despite this temporary setback, Cerebras still intends to go public eventually, underscoring its need for capital amidst immense opportunities in the burgeoning AI market.</p>

The attack, which tragically occurred on Yom Kippur, involved Al-Shamie driving a car into people before stabbing them. One victim was also fatally struck by police gunfire. Families paid tribute to the heroes who died saving others, while an investigation into the use of lethal force is currently underway.</p>
