          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 15:08:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses several methods for borrowers to reduce their credit card debt, given the current economic climate of elevated interest rates and lingering inflation. One option is balance transfer credit cards, which allow borrowers to move existing balances to cards with low or 0% introductory interest rates. Debt consolidation loans, with lower interest rates than credit cards, are another alternative. Debt management programs offer expert assistance and negotiation with credit card companies, while credit card debt forgiveness may be an option for those with significant debt and financial hardships.

Cui, allegedly working on behalf of the Chinese government, and Miller coordinated with individuals, who were actually FBI agents, to procure and export the equipment. They also allegedly planned to silence a U.S. citizen critical of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

          <p>Ukraine executed a complex drone attack, dubbed "Spider Web," targeting Russian air bases, including those housing nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The drones, numbering over 100, were smuggled into Russia in wooden cabins on lorries and launched remotely, striking locations as far as 8,000km from Ukraine. Ukraine claims to have hit 41 strategic bombers and destroyed at least 13, while Russia acknowledged damage only in Murmansk and Irkutsk. The operation, supervised by President Zelensky, took over a year to prepare and cost Russia an estimated $7 billion.</p>

A long-term CD also provides protection against stock market volatility, as the interest rate remains fixed throughout the CD's term.

The Club added Boeing to its Bullpen watch list on April 10, anticipating it would benefit from trade deals. The thesis proved correct with significant orders following U.S. trade agreements with the UK and countries in the Middle East. Despite missing the initial move, the Club remains optimistic about Boeing's turnaround and potential for further gains, especially if trade tensions re-escalate. (not investment advice)</p>
