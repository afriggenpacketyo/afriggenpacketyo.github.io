        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Memphis, Tennessee, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr., three former police officers, were acquitted on all state charges, including second-degree murder, related to the sexual assault of Tyre Nichols during a traffic stop in 2023. The verdict, reached after about 8 1/2 hours of deliberation, prompted outrage from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who called it a "devastating miscarriage of justice". Despite the acquittal, the officers still face federal charges, raising the possibility of years in prison. The incident, caught on camera, sparked nationwide protests and renewed calls for police reform in the United States.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the US ambassador following a report in The Wall Street Journal alleging that US spy agencies were directed to focus on Greenland. The report detailed that the US was interested in the semi-autonomous country's independence movement and mineral resources, which prompted Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen to express his concern, stating that Denmark does not spy on friends. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused the Journal of undermining President Trump by leaking classified information, though she did not deny the report itself. President Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, even suggesting the possibility of using military force.</p>

The corner of the residence typically used by first ladies remains dark, suggesting she does not regularly reside in Washington. Melania Trump often retreats to Trump Tower in Manhattan or Mar-a-Lago in Florida, leading to comparisons with Greta Garbo due to her elusive nature. While officials claim she visits the White House more than publicly known, they provide no specific details, creating an air of mystery around her role.</p>

          <p>Shares of Nvidia experienced a surge on Wednesday following reports that the Trump administration intends to rescind the "AI diffusion" rule, which regulates chip trade. This rule, proposed during the Biden administration, categorizes countries into tiers with varying restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed the rule, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stating that being excluded from the Chinese AI market would be a significant loss. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need to balance national security with supporting the American chip industry.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the White House is likely to withdraw Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General.

President Trump had previously praised Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, for her work during the coronavirus pandemic. Nesheiwat is also the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who faced scrutiny for his involvement in a Signal group chat discussing military plans.</p>

          <p>The Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, Judge Jefferson Griffin, conceded on Wednesday after a judge rejected his legal challenges to the election results. This ends Griffin's six-month effort to overturn the election in the state. Griffin conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge appointed by Republican President Donald Trump rejected Griffin's legal challenges to the election. Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the GOP-majority court.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate unchanged between 4.25%-4.5%, citing increased economic uncertainty and heightened risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation. This decision comes as the central bank weighs the impact of President Trump's trade policies on the economy. Chair Jerome Powell noted that the economy remains in solid shape, but the Fed is closely monitoring trade negotiations. The FOMC statement raises the possibility of a stagflationary scenario, balancing the dual mandate of full employment and stable prices amid potential tariff-related disruptions.</p>

The park, developed in partnership with Miral, will feature a spiraling crystal castle and waterfront attractions. Disney has been criticized for not taking stronger stances against anti-LGBTQ+ policies in Florida, and its partnership with a company in the United Arab Emirates, which has a poor human rights record, raises further concerns. The "experiences" sector, which includes theme parks, makes up a major part of Disney's business.</p>

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry brand, has cautioned that proposed tariff hikes by the U.S. President Donald Trump will cause significant price increases in the affordable jewelry sector. CEO Alexander Lacik said that while current 10% levies are manageable, higher "reciprocal" rates would be game-changing for jewelry manufacturers who import from Asia. The tariffs would likely lead to consumer pricing changes. Pandora relies heavily on manufacturing in Asia, particularly Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, which were targeted with tariffs ranging from 26% to 46%.</p>

          <p>Ford is increasing the sticker prices on three U.S. models imported from Mexico by up to $2,000 each. This decision comes shortly after Ford executives stated they didn't anticipate a major industrywide increase in car prices this year. Ford said that the price hike does not apply to vehicles currently on the lot, but will apply to those built after May 2. The price hike does not mean customers will necessarily pay $2,000 more per vehicle.</p>
