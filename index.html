          <p>President Trump signed an order to implement parts of a trade agreement with the UK, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US, with a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The UK government hopes this will shield British businesses from Trump's tariffs, which were imposed to encourage the purchase of American-made goods. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year, and will remove tariffs on certain aerospace products. Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK will update parliament on the implementation of quotas on US beef and ethanol under the deal.</p>

          <p>President Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, citing developments in the Middle East as the reason for his early return to Washington. He stated that he had "spoken to everybody" regarding Israel and Iran and believed a deal would be signed. Trump also mentioned that Iran wanted to talk, but should have done so sooner, before the recent escalation. His sudden departure came as Israel and Iran traded airstrikes and missile attacks, intensifying the conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Baroness Louise Casey's report into group-based sexual assault reveals significant failures at all levels in addressing these crimes. The report emphasizes that authorities have avoided discussing the ethnicity of perpetrators, with ethnicity data missing for two-thirds of them, hindering the ability to draw national-level conclusions about offenders. The government has accepted all of Casey's recommendations, but the report points out that many of the highlighted problems have been known for years without effective action. The report also notes a tendency to blame the children being abused instead of providing them with help and viewing them as children who were sexually assaulted rather than as 'wayward teenagers'.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a fireworks factory in China's Hunan province resulted in at least nine deaths and 26 injuries, with rescue operations complicated by the risk of additional explosions and a lack of nearby water sources. The Ministry of Emergency Management has dispatched a team to oversee the rescue and investigate the cause of the explosion, emphasizing the need to hold those responsible accountable. Industrial accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards, with previous incidents including chemical plant explosions and fires causing numerous fatalities. Remote-controlled water cannons were used to extinguish the fire during the rescue operation.</p>

          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, £500 million contract to supply train tracks for Network Rail, securing thousands of jobs at the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract, starting July 1, ensures British Steel will provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs, with other European steelmakers supplying specialist products. The government took control of British Steel in April to prevent the closure of blast furnaces and is exploring both full public ownership and private investment options. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that this contract transforms the outlook for British Steel, demonstrating progress in strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles that protect Israel, but building a similar system in the U.S. would be more complex due to America's larger size and the different types of missiles that could be used to attack it. Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies compares the difference in complexity to that between a kayak and a battleship. The goal of this system is to provide comprehensive missile protection for the entire United States.</p>

          <p>According to Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, Israel’s recent attacks have significantly altered Iran’s trajectory, which had been gradually improving due to the efforts of the Iranian people. Despite facing challenges from an oppressive government, Iran had been experiencing slow but steady progress in its political, economic, and social conditions. The election of President Masoud Pezeshkian aimed to repair Iran’s social contract, with modest progress made in regaining public trust. However, Israel’s attacks have undermined these efforts, demonstrating a disregard for the agency and aspirations of the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, oscillating between supporting Israeli strikes and distancing himself from them, complicated by his early departure from the G7 summit. He faces pressure from various sides, including Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and hawkish Republicans advocating for military action. Trump's options range from escalating involvement to maintaining the current course or pulling back, influenced by domestic political considerations and the potential risks of further escalation. The article analyzes these factors and potential outcomes, considering Trump's "America First" foreign policy promise.</p>
