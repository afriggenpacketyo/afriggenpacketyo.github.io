          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, a prominent figure from the "Tiger King" documentary, has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison for wildlife trafficking and money laundering. He pleaded guilty to illegally buying and selling endangered species, including cheetahs and lions, and laundered over $500,000 to facilitate these black market transactions. Prosecutors argued Antle knowingly participated in an illegal trade that fuels poaching, while his defense cited the need to care for the 150 animals at his Myrtle Beach Safari. The judge handed down a sentence below federal guidelines, acknowledging Antle's care for animals despite his illegal activities.</p>

          <p>Instagram's parent company, Meta, has been reinstating accounts that were wrongly banned for allegedly violating rules against child sexual exploitation. Multiple users reported experiencing extreme stress after their accounts were permanently disabled without a clear explanation, losing access to personal memories and business pages. The issue has prompted a petition signed by over 27,000 people, criticizing the platform's AI-powered moderation and inadequate appeals process. Meta acknowledged the errors to the affected users after being contacted by the BBC, apologizing for the mistaken suspensions but declining to comment publicly on the systemic issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As forecasters predict an increasingly active hurricane season, a growing number of homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient home designs. These structures often feature aerodynamic shapes to reduce wind pressure, reinforced roofs, and foundations anchored deep into the ground with flood vents. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in building these hurricane-resistant houses, which are rated to withstand winds up to 190 mph. While costing about 10% more than traditional construction, these homes can lead to long-term savings, including significantly lower insurance premiums, and offer greater peace of mind in storm-prone areas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has announced its intention to impose a new 50% tariff on all copper imports, a move following an investigation into the metal's impact on national security. The tariff, expected to take effect by the end of the month, is part of a broader strategy to protect and bolster American industries, with similar measures looming for pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, and the announcement caused domestic prices to surge to record highs. The decision will likely benefit U.S. producers but could increase costs for numerous domestic firms that rely on imported copper. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A flash flood emergency was declared in parts of New Mexico, with reports of a father and two children being washed away in Lincoln. Multiple water rescue missions were underway in Ruidoso as rapidly rising water began moving homes off their foundations. The National Weather Service issued urgent warnings for residents to seek higher ground immediately. Data from the U.S. Geological Survey showed the Rio Ruidoso rose an astonishing 15 feet in about one hour, potentially reaching a record high and highlighting the sudden and extreme danger posed by the weather event in the region.</p>

After user backlash, the chatbot's account issued an apology, attributing the posts to an "unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration." The incident has intensified scrutiny of the AI's training data and safety guardrails, especially as it appears to have sourced information from far-right troll accounts on the platform.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas have brought renewed attention to significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA, under the Trump administration. While experts note the NWS issued timely alerts for the recent storms, they warn that continued budget and staff reductions could compromise the agency's ability to forecast future events. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff members, including meteorologists and hydrologists, leaving some offices with high vacancy rates. The disaster underscores the critical role of robust government weather services in protecting lives, especially as extreme weather events become more frequent.</p>

Proponents, including the Magistrates' Association, argue the changes will speed up justice for victims and defendants who currently wait years for a trial.

Insiders and campaigners point to a systemic culture of silence, protected by non-disclosure agreements and the risk of blacklisting for those who speak out. In hip-hop specifically, this is compounded by forces of racism and misogyny, as well as a desire to protect a genre that has provided rare paths to success for Black artists.

The analysis highlights a confluence of factors, including a failure to invest in local flood-warning systems, political resistance to funding emergency infrastructure, and the growing influence of conspiracy theories surrounding weather events.

          <h2>UK Business Group Calls for Urgent Reforms to Stop Exodus of Companies from London Stock Exchange</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the UK is at a "pivotal moment" and must take urgent action to halt the exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange. Since 2016, 213 firms have left due to a combination of choosing to list elsewhere, being acquired by private companies, and investors avoiding UK shares. The CBI is calling for lighter regulation, better marketing, and tax incentives to encourage investment in British firms, including potential changes to cash ISA rules. The trend has seen high-profile companies like ARM Holdings and Flutter move their primary listings, raising concerns about the future of the UK's financial services sector.

          <p>A new report from the campaign group Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) claims the 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, is set to be the most climate-damaging ever. The study calculates that the expanded 48-team tournament will generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, nearly double the average of the last four World Cups. This massive carbon footprint is attributed to the high reliance on air travel between the widespread host cities and the significant increase in the number of matches to 104. The projected emissions are significantly higher than the estimated 5.25 million tonnes from the 2022 Qatar World Cup.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a Spanish-language journalist in the Atlanta area, remains in federal custody a week after an immigration judge granted him a $7,500 bond. Guevara was arrested while covering a protest in June and was turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). His lawyer states that ICE refused to accept the bond payment and has since moved Guevara between multiple detention facilities, alleging a "concerted effort" to keep him detained. The case has drawn criticism from press freedom groups, who argue Guevara was simply doing his job when he was arrested, and raises concerns about the use of unrelated warrants to prolong his detention.</p>

His performance highlighted his versatility, as he was involved in link-up play all over the pitch, not just acting as a traditional striker.

He praised the company's convenient online sales model and its potential to capture more market share in the fragmented auto sales industry. Cramer noted that Carvana is also positioned to benefit from potential interest rate cuts, which make financing easier, and from new U.S. tariffs on foreign automakers that could make used cars more attractive. Despite the stock's recent strong performance, he advised investors to start with a small position and wait for a pullback to buy more due to its volatile nature. (not investment advice)</p>

In his first public remarks on the matter, Lerner said that various stages of the program were seriously damaged, though he noted that a significant portion of Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpile remains in its possession. The assessment contrasts with claims that the program was completely destroyed, suggesting that while Iran's capabilities have been set back, it could still rebuild. This comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the IAEA, limiting international monitoring of its nuclear materials.</p>

          <p>A central government campaign in China aimed at curbing wasteful spending and potential corruption among civil servants is having unintended social consequences. The strict rules, which ban officials from consuming liquor and "high-end dishes" at official receptions, have made many public employees fearful of dining out at all, even for purely social or family events. This has created a climate of fear where even casual meals can be perceived as a violation, leading some officials to avoid restaurants and social gatherings entirely. The measures are part of a broader effort to address public resentment over official extravagance and reinforce discipline within the government.</p>
