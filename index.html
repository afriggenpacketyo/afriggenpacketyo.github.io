            <h2>Trump Promises New Tariffs Despite Prior Exemptions on Electronics</h2>

            <p>Despite announcing a 90-day exemption for smartphones, laptops, and other electronic products from import tariffs on China, Donald Trump warned that this reprieve would be short-lived. He promised to launch a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector and the electronics supply chain, vowing not to be held hostage by hostile trading nations like China. Trump's commerce secretary added that critical technology products from China would face separate new duties, including sectoral tariffs targeting semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, in the coming months. The announcement led to market volatility, with investors reacting to the back-and-forth policy reversals. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amidst stock market panic and rising U.S. treasury bond yields, investors are seeking safe haven strategies. The bond ladder concept, involving investment in a range of treasury maturities held to maturity, can provide regular monthly income, as exemplified by the LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF. Independent ETF expert Dave Nadig suggests that bond ladder strategy is a safe bet in an agitated bond market because even as treasury prices and yields swing, it should not matter to the investor holding this kind of fund for regular income needs. Ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs are another option, but the bond ladder can offer broader protection against liabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasizes that mining is often unprofitable and that the U.S. lacks the technologies to refine raw materials.

            <p>Daniel Kretinsky, a Czech billionaire, is set to acquire Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). Despite Royal Mail's struggles with declining letter volumes and competition, Kretinsky sees potential in its logistics business and aims to create a pan-European conglomerate. He plans to honor the universal service obligation (USO) while advocating for its reform. The acquisition also includes GLS, a profitable European parcels business, which Kretinsky hopes to leverage for Royal Mail's operations.</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) stated that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch in foreign relations, responding to a motion for relief by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador. The DOJ argued that the requests by Garcia's attorneys, including demanding actions from the El Salvadoran government and dispatching personnel to a sovereign nation, exceed the court's authority. The DOJ emphasized the constitutional limits on the judiciary's role in foreign affairs.</p>
