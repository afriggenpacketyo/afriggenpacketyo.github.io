          <p>A cyclist in Belfast's Victoria Park was astonished to spot a 4-foot starry smooth-hound shark swimming in the Connswater River, a species previously observed in urban waterways like the Thames. Marine biologist Dr. Patrick Collins suggested the shark was likely feeding on crabs in the river, noting that while not typical, such sightings have been recorded in recent years. The cyclist recounted his disbelief at seeing the dorsal fin and filming the shark as it navigated the river, emphasizing his surprise and curiosity about how far upstream it might travel, adding to the sense of wonder in an otherwise ordinary urban setting.</p>

The inmates created a hole in a cell wall and exited through a loading dock, with authorities suspecting inside assistance due to defective locks and doors. Sheriff Susan Hutson acknowledged a lapse in security and announced a full investigation into the incident, leading to criticism from officials regarding the delay in public notification.

          <p>President Trump engaged in a week of intense diplomatic activity, including business deals in the Gulf, the lifting of sanctions on Syria, and claimed involvement in ceasefires between India and Pakistan, indicating a shift towards a foreign policy focused on trade and national interests. Trump's approach emphasizes commerce over conflict, with a reluctance to intervene in other nations' affairs unless directly benefiting America. The article suggests this strategy is not isolationist but mercantilist, with Trump aiming to clear diplomatic issues to focus on China, though challenges remain in achieving lasting resolutions to global conflicts.</p>

          <p>A top adviser to the Director of National Intelligence ordered a senior analyst to redo an assessment of the relationship between Venezuelaâ€™s government and a gang after intelligence findings undercut the White Houseâ€™s justification for deporting migrants. President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants relies on a claim that intelligence agencies think is wrong, with the original assessment stating the gang was not acting under the Venezuelan governmentâ€™s control. The administration's alarm led to a request for a new assessment, with some officials seeing it as an effort to produce a narrative supporting Trump's agenda, though the council reaffirmed the original findings.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates, including a man convicted of four killings, escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale search operation. The inmates reportedly tore off a toilet-sink appliance in one of the cells and exited the facility through a loading dock, with authorities suspecting a lapse in security and potential outside help. The escape occurred at midnight, but facility guards did not notice they were gone until 8:30 a.m. during a routine headcount, leading to criticism and investigations into the incident.</p>
