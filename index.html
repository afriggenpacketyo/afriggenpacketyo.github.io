          <p>President Donald Trump has postponed the imposition of 50% tariffs on European Union goods until July 9, following discussions with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Despite the delay, analysts caution that significant volatility remains in the market due to ongoing trade tensions. While the EU expresses readiness to advance talks, uncertainty persists regarding the Trump administration's specific demands. Experts suggest the EU is handling negotiations well by seeking a middle ground between capitulation and escalation, however the situation continues to carry a high level of risk for businesses and consumers.

          <p>Nine European Union member states, led by Italy and Denmark, are advocating for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights to facilitate the deportation of foreign national criminals. The group aims to initiate a conversation about providing states with more leeway in expelling and tracking criminal foreigners, as well as countering the instrumentalization of migrants by hostile states. Critics argue that this move could undermine judicial independence and the protection of fundamental rights. Experts suggest that the European Court of Human Rights is not the primary obstacle to deporting criminals and that the effort is largely a political act.</p>

While some EU nations have reduced or suspended arms exports, a significant impact would require the US and Germany to join an embargo. Germany has a long-standing commitment to Israel's security, making a change in policy unlikely without a shift in US foreign policy. The article examines the complexities of arms supply to Israel and the potential implications of an embargo.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed its sporadic eruption, sending lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash and volcanic material. Lava fountains from the mountain's north and south vents reached heights of over 1,000 and 800 feet, respectively. The volcano also released an eruptive plume that reached at least 5,000 feet, containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair. The lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera, posing no immediate threat to residential areas, however the volcanic fragments can be hazardous.</p>

The museum's mission is to explore how narrative art influences societies, but questions remain about its focus and the role of Lucas's personal collection. Despite the turbulence, the museum is expected to draw large crowds upon opening.</p>
