          <p>CrowdStrike's stock experienced a drop after the cybersecurity firm released a lower-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, with projections ranging from $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion, below analysts' estimates of $1.16 billion. The company cited the ongoing impact of a widespread outage from the previous July, which temporarily disrupted flights and hospital procedures, as a contributing factor. Burt Podbere, the finance chief, mentioned that ending the customer commitment packages program reduced revenue by approximately $11 million in the quarter and anticipates a further $10 million to $15 million impact through the fiscal year's end. Despite the disappointing guidance, CrowdStrike exceeded earnings estimates for the first fiscal quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, surpassing the expected 65 cents, and announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that President Trump's proposed tax bill would add $2.4 trillion to the federal budget deficit over the next decade. While the bill, which was passed by House Republicans, aims to decrease federal spending by $1.3 trillion, it would also result in a $3.7 trillion drop in revenues. The bill is expected to undergo further revisions in the Senate, where it is already facing opposition from deficit hawks concerned about the potential for escalating deficits. Senator Ron Johnson has publicly criticized the bill, labeling it as "grotesque" and "immoral," while Elon Musk has also voiced his disapproval, calling it a "disgusting abomination."

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it sees "no viable path" forward for California's high-speed rail project and intends to withdraw $4 billion in federal funding. A 315-page compliance review cited budget shortfalls, missed deadlines, and misleading ridership projections as reasons for the decision. The Department of Transportation criticized the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) for allegedly misleading taxpayers and failing to deliver on its promises. The CHSRA has disputed the findings, stating that the review is misguided and inaccurate. The project has faced numerous challenges, including significant cost overruns and delays, with completion now uncertain. The optimism score for this article is 20.</p>
