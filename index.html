          <p>At least 26 people were killed and 17 others wounded in an attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, targeting tourists in the town of Pahalgam. The attack, which has not been claimed by any group, coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to India, who condemned the killings. Indian authorities have accused rebels of masterminding the attack, sparking outrage and drawing international condemnation, with concerns rising about the potential negative impact on the tourism industry. The attack also comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to inaugurate a railway line to Kashmir Valley, aimed at boosting tourism and economic development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK government borrowing surpassed expectations in the year leading up to March, primarily driven by increased expenditure on pay and benefits. The borrowing reached £151.9 billion, exceeding the official forecast of £137.3 billion, with March alone accounting for £16.4 billion, the third-highest March borrowing since 1993. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is scheduled to attend IMF and World Bank meetings amidst concerns about the UK's economic growth, which has been downgraded due to factors like tariffs and rising borrowing costs. Economists suggest that spending cuts and tax increases may be necessary to meet borrowing rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Democratic Party grapples with low approval ratings and a lack of clear leadership, some members are blaming the media for failing to deliver their message effectively. While some point to Gavin Newsom's engagement with conservative media as a potential strategy, others suggest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) is emerging as an exciting figure who can draw large crowds and raise significant funds. However, questions remain about whether a left-wing candidate from New York City can win over swing states needed to regain the White House. The article suggests Democrats need to make their own news rather than simply criticizing the media.</p>

          <p>The world's coral reefs are experiencing the most severe bleaching event ever recorded, with 84% of them now affected due to rising ocean temperatures caused by human-induced climate change. This crisis, the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, is more intense than the 2014-17 episode. Scientists warn that inaction on climate change is a death sentence for coral reefs, emphasizing the need to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels. They forecast that at 1.5C of warming, 70% to 90% of coral reefs could disappear, and at 2 C, almost all corals would vanish.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced he will reduce his involvement in the Doge initiative following a significant drop in Tesla's profits and revenues during the first quarter of the year. The company attributed the decline to a backlash over Musk's role in Donald Trump's administration, where he leads the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Musk stated his time allocation to Doge would decrease to one to two days per week, acknowledging the impact of his political involvement on Tesla's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index climbing 0.9% year-on-year, primarily due to increases in food and private transport costs. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, slowed to 0.5%. The inflation reading comes as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a concern. Singapore eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time earlier in April, amid expectations of zero growth this year. (not investment advice)</p>
