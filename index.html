        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has finalized the acquisition of Swedish striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record transfer fee of £125 million, which could rise to £130 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old signed a six-year contract after a protracted negotiation process that concluded on the final day of the transfer window. Isak expressed his motivation to "create history and win trophies" with his new club, where he will wear the number nine shirt. This move follows Newcastle's recent signings of other forwards, indicating a strategic shift for the club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's deadline-day plan to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi for £35 million has collapsed despite a deal being agreed upon and a medical underway. The transfer fell through because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement in time, specifically after their target, Igor Julio, chose to join West Ham instead. Guehi, who is in the final year of his contract and does not intend to renew, will now return to Palace. The situation leaves his long-term future uncertain but provides a short-term boost for the London club's defense.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has publicly apologized after a video of him taking a hat from a young boy at the US Open went viral. Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed tennis player Kamil Majchrzak was throwing the hat to him, calling his action a "huge mistake" and not his intention to take a souvenir from a child. He has since returned the hat to the boy. Majchrzak, who won the match before the incident, also reunited with the young fan over the weekend to give him new merchandise.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has secured Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho on a season-long loan, agreeing to cover a significant portion of his substantial wages. The deal includes bonuses that could result in United receiving full wage coverage for the 25-year-old England international. Sancho, who had previously turned down a move to Roma, has not played for Manchester United since August 2024, having spent the last 18 months on loan at other clubs. The move is part of a busy deadline day for Villa, which also signed defender Victor Lindelof.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has stated he would "declare a republic in arms" if his country were attacked by U.S. forces deployed in the Caribbean. Maduro claims the U.S. has positioned eight military vessels with 1,200 missiles as a direct threat, which he called the greatest in a century. The U.S. deployment is officially aimed at combating drug cartels, and Washington has accused Maduro of leading one himself, placing a $50 million bounty on him. Maduro has responded by mobilizing troops and a civilian militia, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

Economists note that immigrants are crucial for alleviating labor shortages, particularly in sectors like agriculture and construction.

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas after the jet ski he was riding collided with another vessel in the waters off Paradise Island. Police found the man unresponsive with visible injuries and medical personnel pronounced him dead at the scene. The incident is currently under investigation. This event comes amid heightened safety concerns for tourists in the area, as the U.S. Embassy recently issued a security alert regarding risks associated with jet ski rentals in Nassau, citing past incidents where U.S. citizens were sexually assaulted by operators.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has criticized reported remarks from EU chief Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-war security guarantees. Pistorius called public discussion of such plans "completely wrong" before negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have even begun. Meanwhile, leaders from Britain and France are set to co-chair a summit to define robust security guarantees for Ukraine. This comes as Kyiv has condemned the China-hosted Shanghai Cooperation Organization for omitting any mention of the war in its closing statement.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has cautioned the U.S. team not to expect the "same pairings or the same lineup" at the upcoming event at Bethpage, despite his team being nearly identical to the one that won in Rome two years ago. Donald confirmed that 11 of the 12 players from the victorious 2023 squad will return. He emphasized that playing away from home presents a "different challenge" requiring a "different strategy," especially since Europe has not won on American soil since 2012 and suffered a heavy defeat in 2021.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story targeting a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of her iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some schools. Atwood's new story sarcastically describes two "very, very good children" who grow up and have a family "without ever having sex," mocking the premise of the ban. This is her latest criticism of the policy, which reflects a growing trend of book challenges moving from the U.S. into Canada.</p>

          <p>A tragic all-terrain vehicle crash at an off-roading park in Alabama resulted in the deaths of two adults and injuries to seven children.

Authorities reported that none of the occupants, who were all from the same family, were wearing proper safety restraints. The driver was ejected and died at the scene, while an adult female passenger later died from her injuries.

          <p>European stock markets saw gains at the start of the month, with the aerospace and defense sector performing particularly well. The rise was spurred by news of a £10 billion order from Norway for British-made warships, which will be built by BAE Systems, causing its shares to climb. In the health-care sector, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk's shares also increased following the release of trial data suggesting its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective than rivals at reducing heart disease risk. Meanwhile, Asian markets were mixed as investors analyzed new manufacturing data from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over her past property dealings. The Conservative opposition has accused Rayner of hypocrisy and potential tax avoidance related to the purchase of a flat in Hove, questioning whether she properly declared it as her main residence. Starmer dismissed the criticism as attempts to "talk her down," praising her as a "great story of British success." A spokesperson for Rayner has stated that she paid all relevant taxes on the property "entirely properly" and in line with all requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones from southern France has found that human influence, particularly since the Middle Ages, has caused a divergence in the body size of wild and domestic animals. Researchers discovered that as humans fragmented forest habitats and intensified hunting, wild species like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control, selective breeding, and specialized management practices. This research highlights the profound and lasting impact of human activities on the evolution of other species.</p>

          <p>The intense fan debate over the love triangle in the hit show "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting Prime Video to launch a campaign for kindness. Fans, divided into opposing teams, have directed harassment at the show's actors, blurring the line between fiction and reality. The show's stars have spoken out about the "scary" nature of some fan interactions. A psychiatrist explains this behavior as a sign of parasocial relationships, one-sided bonds with media figures, which can be exacerbated by the anonymity of social media.</p>
