            <p>Republican Senators Jim Risch and Tommy Tuberville are pressuring governors to implement President Trump's executive order to exclude biological men from women's sports, citing fairness and safety concerns. They argue that biological differences give men an unfair advantage and that states failing to act are jeopardizing female athletes' opportunities. The senators also introduced the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act to codify Trump's order and have contacted the International Olympic Committee and NCAA for clarification on related policies. The move reflects a broader debate about transgender athletes' participation in sports and the balance between inclusion and fair competition.</p>

            <p>US workers are experiencing negative impacts due to President Trump's policies, including federal job cuts and tariffs, resulting in layoffs, price increases, and dwindling work opportunities. The shrinking federal government is affecting the private sector, particularly contractors and businesses reliant on federal workers. Rising costs due to tariffs are forcing businesses to increase prices, leading to decreased sales and lost international customers. Concerns are also growing regarding potential cuts to social security and Medicare, which are vital for many Americans' basic needs and healthcare.</p>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the national health secretary, visited the funeral of a child who died from measles but reportedly did not discuss the efficacy of the MMR vaccine, according to the child's father. This silence occurred despite Kennedy later issuing a statement acknowledging the vaccine's effectiveness, though he also praised alternative practitioners who eschew it. The child's death is one of several in an ongoing measles outbreak affecting under-vaccinated communities. The outbreak has raised concerns among public health experts, who emphasize the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of measles.</p>

            <p>US companies, especially those hiring for remote positions, are facing a surge in fake job applicants using AI to create convincing profiles and deepfake identities. These fraudulent candidates aim to steal data, install malware, or simply collect salaries, posing a significant threat to cybersecurity and financial stability. Experts predict a substantial increase in AI-generated profiles among job seekers, prompting companies to invest in identity verification technologies to combat this growing trend. The issue extends beyond the tech industry, with instances of North Korean spies infiltrating US firms using stolen identities.</p>

            <p>Amid stock market volatility spurred by new tariffs, financial experts advise investors to resist emotional reactions and avoid drastic changes to their portfolios. The best course of action for most people is to maintain their current investment strategy and avoid selling stocks during a downturn, as this can lead to losses and missing out on potential market rebounds. It is important to separate emotions from logical financial planning, recognizing that market downturns are a normal part of the investment cycle and that historical trends suggest eventual recovery and growth.

            <p>President Trump's recent tariff announcements have sparked economic chaos both domestically and internationally. The last time the US imposed tariffs on a similar scale was during the Great Depression with the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which led to retaliatory measures from other countries and significantly decreased international trade. Economists largely disapprove of Trump's tariffs, citing a deluded understanding of economics and history. Polls indicate declining approval ratings for Trump's handling of the economy amid concerns about rising prices and the potential for recession.</p>

            <h2>Gray Whale Die-Off Concerns Scientists Along Pacific Coast</h2>

            <p>Gray whales are experiencing another die-off along the Pacific Coast, with at least 70 deaths reported since the start of the year. Researchers are unsure of the cause but suspect it may be related to a lack of food, as some whales have been found in poor condition. The number of whales migrating north this spring is the lowest on record, and no southbound calves were observed. Scientists are monitoring the situation, but it is too early to determine if this will become a widespread mortality event.</p>

West Sacramento officials see the arrival of a major league team as a boon for the city, which has long been overshadowed by its neighbor, Sacramento. The A's will play at Sutter Health Park, home of the minor league River Cats, for three years while their new stadium in Las Vegas is constructed. The city hopes this short-term relationship could lead to a permanent Major League Baseball presence in the region.</p>

            <p>Creating a successful yard that combines bountiful vegetables and fragrant native plants requires careful planning to address their different needs. Experts recommend hydro-zoning, separating plants by watering zones, and using raised beds for vegetables to manage soil enrichment. Native plants thrive in unamended soils and require less water once established, while vegetables need nutrient-rich soil and regular irrigation. Integrating both creates an edible habitat garden that supports both human needs and local ecosystems.</p>

The shift wasn't driven by softened racial attitudes, but rather by witnessing the deprivation of inner-city schools. The study highlights the potential for formative experiences in adolescence to shape political identities decades later.</p>
