          <p>The Walt Disney Company is raising subscription prices for its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN streaming services, with changes taking effect on October 21. For instance, the ad-free Disney+ plan will increase by $3 to $18.99 per month. This move follows similar price hikes by competitors like Netflix and Apple, reflecting a broader industry trend of increasing costs for streaming content. The company noted it still expects a modest increase in Disney+ subscribers despite the new pricing structure, which affects various bundled and standalone plans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has canceled a scheduled meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, increasing the likelihood of a federal government shutdown. The meeting was intended to negotiate a funding deal before the September 30 deadline. Democrats are insisting that any agreement include extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits, a demand Trump labeled as "unserious and ridiculous." Democratic leaders accused the president of avoiding negotiations and warned that he would be responsible for the consequences of a shutdown.</p>

Despite the critical tone, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected olive branch moments later, proposing a meeting with Lula for the following week. Trump commented to reporters that he and the Brazilian leader had "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter, suggesting a potential opening for dialogue amid current tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has publicly criticized the ticket prices for the upcoming World Cup, calling the potential $6,000 cost for the final game at MetLife Stadium "absurd." Mamdani highlighted that tickets for the 1994 World Cup final in the U.S. were under $200 in today's currency. He is advocating for FIFA to set aside 15% of tickets at discounted prices for local residents and to abandon its dynamic, demand-based pricing model. This model could cause ticket prices to fluctuate significantly based on popularity.</p>

          <p>Arsenal winger Noni Madueke is expected to be out of action for six to eight weeks due to a knee injury he sustained during a match against Manchester City. The club has confirmed that the injury is not to his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which is a positive sign for his long-term recovery. However, the 23-year-old summer signing will miss several key domestic and European games for Arsenal, as well as upcoming international matches for England. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed hope that the winger's absence would be measured in weeks rather than months.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the current U.S. economy as a "challenging situation," citing the combination of rising inflation and a slowdown in hiring. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell noted that these dual pressures create a difficult scenario for the central bank, which aims to maintain both price stability and maximum employment. He stated that the risks to employment have increased, which was a key factor in the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates. This economic condition, sometimes called "stagflation," complicates monetary policy decisions for the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel suggests that FCC Chair Brendan Carr's threats to revoke broadcast licenses from networks like ABC are likely legally untenable. Historically, the FCC has rarely revoked licenses for content-related issues due to First Amendment protections, making such an action a difficult and prolonged process. The article posits that Carr's real leverage is not license revocation but his regulatory power over media mergers and acquisitions. This influence may explain why station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair, who have business before the FCC, complied with preempting Kimmel's show.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a decree officially classifying the Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization, citing it as a "militarist, anarchist enterprise." This explainer delves into the history of Antifa, which originated in 1930s Germany as an anti-fascist movement and lacks a centralized, hierarchical structure. The movement is a loose coalition of groups and individuals, with ideologies ranging from non-violent protest to more militant actions. Legal experts and the FBI have previously noted that this lack of formal organization makes a terrorist designation legally and practically difficult to implement.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to buy Boeing stock, stating that the investment case for the aircraft manufacturer is strengthening. The primary catalyst is the report that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiating a massive order for Boeing jets, a move aimed at reducing the trade deficit. Cramer notes that this is part of a broader trend where countries striking trade deals with the U.S. include large Boeing orders. Recent deals with Turkey and Uzbekistan further bolster the company's outlook, leading Cramer to believe the stock is "too good to ignore." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has pushed back against accusations, led by President Donald Trump, that the central bank's decisions are politically motivated. Without naming Trump directly, Powell stated that claims of the Fed being political are "just a cheap shot." His comments come amid an ongoing campaign by the White House to exert more control over the independent agency, including attempts to install loyalists on its board. Powell's unusually direct language defends the Fed's integrity and its process of making decisions based on economic data rather than political pressure.</p>

This is the first time a group has been assisted in leaving Gaza for educational purposes in the UK since the war began. The students, all of whom hold fully funded scholarships, were taken to Jordan for visa processing before traveling to universities across the UK. While celebrating the opportunity, advocates note the students' distress over leaving family behind and criticize UK rules that prevent them from bringing dependents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from CDC scientists reveals that infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" in the U.S. increased by almost 70% between 2019 and 2023. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers suggest the surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic likely contributed to this increase. The spread of these bacteria poses a significant public health threat, as it could make common infections like urinary tract infections much more difficult to treat effectively.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast television station owners Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair have announced they will not air "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on their ABC-affiliated stations, despite parent company Disney lifting the host's suspension. The show was paused last week after Kimmel's monologue linked the killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's MAGA movement. Both Nexstar and Sinclair stated they would continue to preempt the show pending assurances of "respectful, constructive dialogue." The decisions highlight tensions between national networks and their local affiliates, particularly amid political pressure from figures like FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging speech to the UN General Assembly, President Donald Trump criticized key international efforts, labeling the fight against climate change a "con job" and a "scam."

The address, which also included complaints about the UN's headquarters, was delivered in a style reminiscent of his campaign rallies.

          <p>In remarks made during an event in Rhode Island, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell observed that by many measures, U.S. asset prices, particularly stocks, seem to be "fairly highly valued." His comment came in response to a question about how much the central bank considers market prices when setting policy. While acknowledging the elevated valuations, which have been fueled by expectations of lower interest rates, Powell also stated that he does not believe this is a period of high financial stability risk. The remarks provide insight into the Fed's view on the current state of the financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision has created a narrative that Europe plays for pride and cause, while the U.S. team is focused on money. European captain Luke Donald noted his players unanimously rejected an offer of payment, underscoring the different philosophies and adding a layer of psychological tension to the transatlantic golf competition.</p>
