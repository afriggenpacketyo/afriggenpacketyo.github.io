          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory at the Japanese Grand Prix, overcoming a strong challenge from McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Norris initially complained about Verstappen's aggressive driving, but stewards sided with Verstappen. Despite consistent pressure from the McLarens, Verstappen managed his tires effectively to maintain his lead. Piastri's impressive pace led him to suggest a team order switch to challenge Verstappen, but McLaren opted not to interfere, allowing the drivers to finish in their established order. The top three drivers were significantly ahead of the rest of the field throughout the race, with Leclerc holding off Russell for fourth. Optimism score: 85</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel, sparking criticism from Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who deemed the action unacceptable and counterproductive. Israeli authorities accused the MPs of intending to spread hate speech and document security forces, a claim the MPs refuted, stating their aim was to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand. The MPs, both recently elected, have been vocal about the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Mohamed advocating for a ban on goods from Israeli settlements. The incident underscores the contentious nature of the conflict and the challenges faced by international observers seeking to understand the situation on the ground. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of catastrophic earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. The research, published shortly before a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, analyzed 150 years of seismic data to identify major earthquake active periods correlating with shifts in the Earth's rotational speed. This has sparked debate about whether tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase. The study highlights the importance of understanding seismic patterns and the potential for catastrophic events. Optimism score: 40</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, 'Underdogs,' argues that the distinctiveness of the white working class is less about ethnicity and more about geography, with many residing outside metropolitan areas neglected by national politicians. This geographical isolation leads to disparities in education, social mobility, and access to opportunities. While white working-class Britons are more opposed to immigration than white middle-class Britons, they also show a diversity of opinion – from liberal to xenophobic – that is often ignored. The author suggests that the left's neglect of class politics has allowed parties with regressive policies to portray themselves as champions of working-class interests. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Amidst Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs, Britain is urged to resist making damaging concessions and instead collaborate with the G7 (excluding the US), the EU, and Asia to uphold a rules-based global trading system. Mark Carney's potential leadership in Canada is seen as pivotal in constructing a new global trade order. The proposed strategy involves associating Canada with the EU as a privileged trade partner, extending the terms to a newly relevant commonwealth, and implementing reciprocal sanctions on selected US service exports. The goal is to create an alternative framework that Britain can actively contribute to, offsetting the negative impacts of Trump's trade policies. Optimism score: 65</p>

The increased sales have allowed HBC to keep six stores from liquidating, despite owing almost one billion dollars to creditors.
