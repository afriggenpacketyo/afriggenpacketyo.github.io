          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is initiating an investigation into Meta following a report that the company's internal guidelines permitted AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children. The probe aims to determine if Meta's AI products enable child exploitation and whether the company misled the public about its safety measures. Hawley has demanded that CEO Mark Zuckerberg preserve all relevant documents for the investigation by the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism. Meta stated that the reported guidelines were erroneous, inconsistent with its policies, and have since been removed.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that President Trump's tax legislation will provide varied benefits across the country, with some states and counties seeing significantly larger average tax cuts. In 2026, Wyoming and Washington residents are projected to see the highest average savings, while resort areas like Teton County, Wyoming, could see disproportionately large cuts due to high-income earners. Conversely, a Congressional Budget Office report suggests the bill could benefit top earners while lower-income households may see a decrease in resources due to cuts in social programs.

          <p>Former tennis champion Monica Seles has publicly shared her five-year struggle with myasthenia gravis, a rare and incurable autoimmune disease that causes weakness in voluntary muscles. In collaboration with the immunology company argenx, Seles aims to raise awareness about the condition, which can cause symptoms ranging from eyelid drooping to severe difficulty with breathing and swallowing. A neurologist explains that while the disease can be serious, most patients can live fairly normal lives with proper management. Treatments often involve medications that calm the immune system, with newer, more targeted therapies now available.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell over 13% after the company issued weak financial guidance for the upcoming quarter. The company cited growing uncertainty and reduced visibility, primarily related to its business in China, as well as weakness from leading-edge customers. CEO Gary Dickerson noted that Chinese clients are scaling back spending after a period of rapid manufacturing expansion. Despite beating third-quarter estimates, the forecast for future revenue and earnings fell short of analyst expectations, prompting a stock downgrade from Bank of America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season less predictably profitable than in previous years due to shifting consumer behaviors and economic uncertainty. Carriers have reduced their August flight schedules as travelers book earlier in the season and some shift European trips to the fall. This adjustment comes after many airlines lowered their 2025 profit forecasts due to an overhang of capacity that pushed down fares earlier in the summer. Now, with capacity cuts, fares are expected to rise again as airlines adapt to new travel trends, such as earlier school start dates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novel, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." It explores Spark's narrative style, her use of omniscience, and her central concern with moral and religious themes, stemming from her conversion to Catholicism. The story of Miss Brodie and her chosen students is examined as an investigation into the impressionable nature of adolescence and the lasting influence a charismatic teacher can have. The piece highlights how Spark realistically portrays the complex process of forming one's own identity and moral compass, separate from the powerful figures of childhood.</p>

          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that a new Department of Energy (DOE) report on climate change was secretly produced by "known climate contrarians" to undermine established science. The report, which questions the severity of climate change and highlights potential benefits of CO2, is being used by the EPA to justify revoking the 2009 Endangerment Finding. The lawsuit argues the report was created without transparency and is filled with inaccuracies, designed to provide a political basis for rolling back climate regulations. Critics claim the administration is not just defunding climate research but actively rewriting the science itself.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of AI-Generated Fake Quotes Poses a Growing Challenge to Authenticity</h2>

          <p>The proliferation of AI chatbots is exacerbating the long-standing issue of fake quotations online, with public figures and ordinary individuals alike being misattributed with things they never said. This article explores recent examples, including science-fiction author John Scalzi and an Atlantic writer, who discovered AI-generated quotes falsely credited to them circulating online. This phenomenon pollutes public discourse by creating a veneer of authority for fabricated content, making it increasingly difficult for people to distinguish between genuine and artificial information. The ease of generating convincing but false content at scale presents a significant challenge for maintaining an informed society.</p>

          <p>A $177 million settlement has been proposed to compensate millions of AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches announced in 2024.

Eligible customers are being notified and can file claims for up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses traceable to the breaches. The deadline to file a claim is November 18, 2025, though the settlement still requires final court approval at a hearing scheduled for December.</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the federal government following President Trump's move to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control. The suit challenges the legality of the takeover and an order from Attorney General Pam Bondi appointing the head of the DEA as the city's "emergency police commissioner." D.C. officials argue the move is an unlawful abuse of authority that will upend the police command structure and endanger public safety. The Trump administration has justified the action by citing a need to crack down on crime in the capital.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced a joint resolution to terminate President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force. Led by Representative Jamie Raskin, the resolution invokes the Home Rule Act of 1973, arguing that the President has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required to legally take control of the local department. The sponsors contend that Trump's justification relies on misleading claims about the city's crime rate, which has actually been declining. They assert that the takeover is an egregious attack on D.C.'s autonomy and has worsened public safety.</p>

In India-administered Kashmir, a remote Himalayan village was struck by flash floods that killed at least 60 people, with many more still missing. Experts attribute the increasing frequency of intense rainfall events, known as cloudbursts, to climate change, which is worsening the annual monsoon season's destructive impact.</p>

          <p>Salford's upcoming Super League match against Wakefield has been cancelled over significant player welfare concerns following discussions with the Rugby Football League (RFL). The financially troubled club, which recently suffered an 80-6 defeat, has been relying heavily on loanees and debutants as most senior players have departed. The club stated that of the 17 players available for the match, only two had recent Super League experience. The RFL board will now determine the official outcome of the cancelled fixture, while discussions continue about Salford's ability to complete the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, centered in the Geysers geothermal steam field across Sonoma and Lake counties. The tremors, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 4.0, are common in this volcanically active area. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, these minor quakes are often induced by the operations of the geothermal power facilities located there. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity can cause stress changes in the surrounding rock, leading to frequent, low-magnitude seismic activity.</p>

The author contends that failing to designate these groups allows them to operate under the guise of political or charitable work while promoting extremist ideologies.
