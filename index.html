          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its crackdown on student visas, planning to "aggressively revoke visas" for Chinese students at U.S. universities, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This action follows escalating disputes with Harvard and broader concerns about intellectual property and national security. The Department of Justice has also requested a delay in a court ruling against Trump's tariff policy, warning of a potential "foreign policy disaster scenario." The administration contends that the ruling would strip the president of crucial leverage in trade negotiations, further complicating international relations. The revocation of visas aims to address concerns over Chinese students potentially linked to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to President Trump, remains confident that court rulings against the administration's tariffs will be overturned on appeal. Hassett asserts the tariffs are legal and essential for ensuring fair trade, emphasizing their effectiveness for the American people. The comments come after judges ruled Trump exceeded his authority on tariffs aimed at combating barriers against American goods and stemming fentanyl flow. Hassett criticized the judges as "activist judges" and expressed certainty that the ruling will be overturned, underscoring the administration's determination to continue its anti-fentanyl efforts.

          <p>Following a U.S. Court ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative legal means to maintain its trade policies. Goldman Sachs economists suggest the White House could utilize Section 122 of U.S. trade law for swift action or launch Section 301 investigations on key trading partners. Legal experts like Michelle Schulz note that past tariffs required investigations, unlike the executive orders used for the blocked tariffs. James Ransdell suggests the Supreme Court could ultimately decide the matter, while Steven Blitz indicates Trump may seek an emergency appeal to keep tariffs in place during the appeals process.

          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips are a "failure," arguing that these policies prioritize national security over commercial interests. The author contends that the restrictions aim to prevent China's military advancement, regardless of Nvidia's market share in China. The piece asserts that China's innovation model is evolving, with Chinese firms combining global knowledge with domestic capital and policy. The author suggests Nvidia should focus on competing in other markets rather than its diminishing market share in China, highlighting the importance of safeguarding leading-edge technologies for U.S. strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is giving Harvard University 30 days to challenge the revocation of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, a partial backtrack from Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's earlier announcement. This decision comes ahead of a federal hearing concerning Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued to block the policy, arguing the students have become "pawns in the government's escalating campaign of retaliation," and a federal judge granted a temporary order barring the revocation. The lawsuit alleges the revocation is unlawful because it violates free speech rights and due process protections, part of a broader dispute over Harvard's governance and curriculum.</p>

This move is considered a contentious issue between Israel and the Palestinians, with settlements widely seen as illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.

          <p>Following the Trump administration's announcement to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students, many applicants in Beijing expressed anxiety and helplessness. Despite successfully applying for visas, students like Li Kunze are uncertain about their prospects, fearing further restrictions. The move reflects a broader trend of uncertainty for Chinese students studying in the U.S., with some considering alternatives due to the perceived hostility. Chinese officials have criticized the U.S. action as discriminatory, but China's limited leverage in student exchanges means retaliation may occur in other areas, such as fentanyl control or rare earths exports.</p>

          <p>High school sports programming on PBS stations, particularly in states without professional sports, is at risk due to potential federal funding cuts. These local programs, including championship coverage, have increased viewership and donor support for public broadcasters. President Trump's executive order to cut federal funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has raised concerns. While national shows like "Sesame Street" receive attention, locally produced content makes up the majority of PBS stations' lineups. A PBS spokesperson indicated the organization is considering legal action to continue providing essential programming.</p>

Short-term CDs currently offer more competitive annual percentage yields (APY) due to market uncertainty.

The order relies on the legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows temporary admission on humanitarian or public interest grounds.
