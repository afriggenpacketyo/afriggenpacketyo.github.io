        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, surpassing forecasts of 0.1% despite slowing from the previous quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the services and construction sectors, with revised upward estimates for April's GDP. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged positive signs, opposition figures criticized the pace of growth, and economists expressed doubt about maintaining this momentum due to global economic weakness and potential future tax rises. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates to 4% amidst these economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, reported a 27% year-over-year increase in second-quarter operating profit, significantly exceeding forecasts. This strong performance was primarily fueled by its burgeoning artificial intelligence server business, which for the first time accounted for a larger share of revenue (41%) than smart consumer electronic products (35%). The company anticipates continued substantial growth in its AI server segment for the current quarter. However, evolving global political and economic conditions, including potential US tariffs, are being closely monitored. (not investment advice)</p>

The jury delivered the verdict after a three-day trial, with Rossi facing a potential sentence of five years to life in prison. He is also slated for another sexual assault trial in September in Utah County. Authorities identified Rossi through a decade-old DNA kit, and he was arrested in Scotland after hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos from an Interpol notice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Chinese households, particularly older generations, maintain a strong aversion to debt, viewing borrowing primarily for significant assets like homes. This cultural inclination makes them likely to resist new loan subsidy schemes aimed at stimulating spending. Even younger individuals like Sally Wan are not entirely enthusiastic about debt-fueled consumption. This ingrained financial prudence among Chinese consumers presents a challenge for government efforts to boost domestic spending through credit initiatives, potentially hindering broader economic stimulus goals.

          <p>The United States Department of State has designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, as foreign terrorist organizations. This action, part of the Trump administration's commitment to countering terrorism, is seen by analysts as potentially easing China's long-held concerns over fatal terrorist attacks that often target Chinese citizens. Experts suggest this move could open a new avenue for counterterrorism cooperation between China and the US, facilitated through Pakistan, fostering greater regional stability.</p>

          <p>This article explains BTecs, which are practical qualifications in the UK, assessed through exams, coursework, and projects. BTec Firsts are equivalent to GCSEs (Level 2), while BTec Nationals are comparable to A-levels (Level 3) and can lead to university or direct employment. Graded from Pass to Starred Distinction, BTecs are popular among a diverse range of students, including many over 22 and white working-class students. Recent government policy shifts have paused plans to scrap numerous BTecs, recognizing their importance in key sectors.</p>

While no one was injured in the shootings, which occurred between December 2022 and January 2023, some incidents happened while children were present.

Unlike primary sanctions that restrict a sanctioning country's own citizens, secondary sanctions leverage the US dollar's global importance and access to its financial system to compel compliance. While successful in past cases like Iran, experts debate their overall effectiveness, noting challenges in enforcement, risk of retaliation, and potential to push targeted nations closer together.

          <p>Despite Singapore's reputation for financial prudence, a growing number of its workers, 60% in 2024, are living paycheck to paycheck, a figure higher than regional peers. This trend is attributed to soaring living costs, particularly expensive housing and import reliance, which have outpaced income growth since the pandemic. Experts also point to cultural shifts, with younger generations prioritizing experiences and lifestyle over traditional saving habits, exacerbated by the ease of "buy now, pay later" schemes.

          <p>This article examines the rising costs of university in the UK, with annual tuition fees in England and Wales increasing to £9,535, alongside sharply rising living expenses. It details the varying fee structures across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, and explains how student loans and maintenance grants work. While most graduates generally earn more than non-graduates, the article notes a real-term decline in graduate wages since 2015, with earnings significantly depending on the subject studied and university attended.

          <p>A growing trend sees over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, bringing family members, friends, or even pets on work trips, a phenomenon dubbed "bleisure" travel. This allows professionals to reclaim personal time and reduce travel costs, turning work trips into budget-friendly mini-vacations. While companies often view this as a "policy grey zone" regarding expenses and liability, many employers are increasingly accepting it as long as business objectives are met. This blend of personal and business travel is projected to reach $731 billion globally by 2032.</p>

          <p>Anchorage, Alaska, is abuzz as it prepares to host the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, a significant diplomatic event for the city. Residents express a mix of excitement at being on the global map and trepidation about the meeting's implications, especially given Alaska's historical ties to Russia and its proximity. There's a satirical local sentiment of "Please don't sell us back," referencing the 1867 purchase of Alaska.

          <p>The trial concerning President Trump's deployment of 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles concluded, with the judge questioning the limits of presidential authority.

The Justice Department claimed the act didn't apply and the court lacked jurisdiction. The judge expressed concern over the "absence of any limits to a national police force" and the justification for the continued military presence, highlighting a fundamental debate on federalism and military use.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who report drinking alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a dip coinciding with increased concern about the health risks of even moderate drinking. Experts suggest this shift is driven by greater public knowledge regarding alcohol's negative effects, including increased risks of cancer and mental health issues. Younger generations, in particular, are more inclined to view moderate drinking as harmful and are embracing alcohol-free alternatives. This trend may also be influenced by social acceptability shifts and economic factors.</p>
