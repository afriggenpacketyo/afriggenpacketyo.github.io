          <p>A powerful storm system swept across the Heartland and East Coast, resulting in at least 27 deaths across multiple states, including Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia. The storms left over 462,000 customers without power from Michigan to Tennessee, and caused widespread property damage. St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer described the event as one of the city's worst storms, with five fatalities and 38 injuries reported. The storms generated at least 26 tornadoes across several states, accompanied by large hail, and prompting weather alerts across the affected regions, with the highest threat centered over portions of upstate New York, western Massachusetts, most of Vermont and western New Hampshire, including Burlington, Vermont; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Albany, New York, with the primary risks being damaging winds and large hail and a few isolated tornadoes also possible.</p>

Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues, with warnings from UN agencies about rapidly dwindling fuel, food, and medicine supplies, and food security experts warning of famine if the blockade isn't lifted. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the ongoing war in Gaza and joint efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages with Netanyahu by phone from Rome.</p>

          <p>The Baltimore Orioles have fired manager Brandon Hyde after a 15-28 start to the season, despite Hyde winning manager of the year honors in 2023. General manager Mike Elias cited the poor start as his responsibility and said the change was necessary to set a different course for the future, with third base coach Tony Mansolino serving as interim manager. The move comes after the Orioles played sub-.500 baseball after a strong start last year and were swept out of the playoffs for a second straight season. The team's struggles include the worst ERA in the American League and a poor batting average with runners in scoring position, leading to scrutiny of Elias's rebuild efforts.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants facing expulsion. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants in Texas, stating it did not pass muster. Legal scholars have hailed the courts' support of due process but expressed concern that such support was needed in the first place. The Supreme Court's decision comes as Trump officials have openly flouted the idea of providing due process to immigrants, with the administration even considering suspending the writ of habeas corpus.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, following a Russian drone attack that killed nine civilians. The call comes after fruitless peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul, and amid intensified assaults across the front. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate attack on civilians and called for strong sanctions against Russia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, emphasizing Trump's call for an immediate cease-fire.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took U.S. sanctions officials by surprise, leading to internal discussions at the Treasury Department to determine the extent and pace of the rollback. The decision, which aims to give Syria a chance at greatness, was made during an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital. The new Syrian government has been pushing for sanctions relief to address economic challenges, while Turkey and Saudi Arabia have backed normalizing relations and providing aid to Syria.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democrats are facing significant challenges ahead of the 2026 elections, including the re-election prospects of Governor Katie Hobbs, a state party in turmoil, and the rise of formidable Republican opponents. Hobbs, considered one of the nation‚Äôs most vulnerable Democratic governors, faces potential challenges from hard-right populist Andy Biggs and moderate businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson, both endorsed by President Trump. The state party is also experiencing infighting, adding to the difficulties Democrats face in a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have begun a new round of ceasefire talks brokered by Qatari and US mediators, following a major Israeli offensive. The talks, which are taking place in Doha, are centered around the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a period of calm. The new round of talks comes after a week of intensifying bombardments and airstrikes, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launching "Operation Gideon's Chariots" to occupy and control swathes of Gaza. The intensified offensive has been condemned by the UN and some European leaders, as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is increasing its economic and strategic presence in Africa as the United States and China reduce their investments. The UAE's investments in key sectors like ports, mines, and renewable energy have surged, with $110 billion worth of deals announced since 2019. This expansion is part of an ambitious plan to diversify the UAE's economy and increase its influence over global supply chains. While the U.S. reduces its presence in Africa, the UAE's efforts are bolstered by President Trump, who seeks to draw Emirati money to the United States.</p>

          <p>Combat sport clubs are being used to boost recruitment for a white nationalist hate group, the Patriot Front, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. These Active Clubs, smaller networks of white supremacist groups, train in mixed martial arts and bond over white nationalist ideologies. Patriot Front uses these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, and the clubs maintain a robust online presence to encourage young men to become radicalized. The new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, after years of controversies stemming from various lawsuits and acts of vandalism.</p>

The article contrasts the museum's inspiring presentation with a history that is focused on grievance and frustration. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging both the tragedies and triumphs of Black history, highlighting the museum's ability to balance the past with the present and future. The museum's approach should be an example for other institutions to follow, as it does not shy away from the tragedies, but neither does it give short shrift to the joy.</p>

The two sides had been engaged in negotiations for months and, according to Mr. Kolluri, who has been leading the agency‚Äôs bargaining team, had been 95 percent of the way to a deal, but reached an impasse on the issue of pay. The meetings offer a glimmer of hope for a swift end to the strike, which has hobbled the transit agency and stranded thousands of commuters. NJ Transit's engineers want to be paid on par with those at other commuter railroads in the area, but Mr. Kolluri has said that the agency cannot afford those pay increases.</p>
