          <p>Amidst ongoing conflict, Ukraine's President Zelensky expressed cautious interest in direct talks with Russia, contingent on an immediate ceasefire, while Russia proposed talks in Turkey, omitting the ceasefire condition. European leaders, having visited Kyiv, set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day ceasefire or face increased sanctions, supported by the United States. President Trump urged both sides to meet in Turkey, emphasizing the need to determine the possibility of a deal, as his administration aligns with Russia on certain UN votes regarding the war, but Ukraine agreed to an American proposal for an unconditional ceasefire in March. The article highlights the complex diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential trade truce that could positively impact financial markets. While specific details remain undisclosed, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a deal addressing national security concerns related to China's trade practices. The talks, led by Bessent and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to alleviate tensions stemming from tariffs imposed by both nations, which have disrupted global supply chains.

          <p>Hamas has announced the impending release of Edan Alexander, an American citizen who was taken hostage on October 7, 2023. This decision comes as part of ongoing efforts by mediators to establish a ceasefire, and Alexander's release is intended to facilitate the reopening of crossings and ensure humanitarian aid reaches the Gaza Strip. Alexander, a 20-year-old Israeli-American soldier from New Jersey, was abducted from a military base near the Gaza border during the initial attack.

          <p>Pepper Stetler, in a guest essay for the New York Times, argues that President Trump's proposed budget cuts to the Department of Education and changes to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) could negatively impact students with disabilities. She highlights the case of Adaline, a student with Down syndrome, who faced segregation in her school district and was initially denied the opportunity to earn a high school diploma. Stetler contrasts Adaline's experience with her own daughter's inclusive education in Ohio, emphasizing the importance of federal oversight to ensure that states meet the minimum requirements of IDEA. The article underscores the potential consequences of reduced federal intervention, warning of an erosion of the promise of a free and appropriate public education for students with disabilities.</p>

The article suggests that unless Charles finds a way to heal the rift with Harry, it could define his reign and undercut his messages of tolerance and inclusiveness.
