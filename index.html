          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged Patricia Kadgien, the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer, after a painting looted during World War II was discovered in an online real estate listing for her home. The 18th-century artwork, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, had been missing for 80 years before being spotted by Dutch journalists. The heir of the original Jewish owner has filed a claim to reclaim the painting, which is part of a larger effort to recover art stolen by the Nazis. Following a police raid, Kadgien eventually surrendered the artwork to authorities.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London opposing the UK government's decision to proscribe the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in over 425 arrests. Hundreds gathered in Parliament Square, with most arrests made for the offense of supporting a banned organization under the Terrorism Act. The Metropolitan Police reported significant abuse towards officers, while protest organizers accused the police of using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators. The event highlights the deep societal divisions and the contentious nature of the government's ban on the direct-action group.</p>

          <p>More than 25 million people across the U.S. Northeast, from Maryland to Maine, are under alert for severe weather conditions. A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect for major metropolitan areas along the I-95 corridor, including New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. The primary threats are damaging wind gusts, large hail, and localized flash flooding caused by slow-moving storms with torrential rain. The storm system is expected to continue into the overnight hours before cooler, fall-like air moves into the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to Chicago has been met with deeply divided reactions from the city's residents. Some community leaders and activists argue that local violence prevention programs are already working and that a military presence is unnecessary and provocative. Conversely, other residents in high-crime neighborhoods express support for the intervention, believing it is needed to restore order. This debate occurs as city and state officials vow to legally resist what they describe as an unwarranted federal overreach.</p>

          <p>The immediate threat to the Hawaiian islands from Hurricane Kiko has significantly decreased as the storm's path has shifted further north. Forecasters at the National Weather Service now indicate that the state will likely be spared from strong winds and widespread heavy rain. However, officials continue to warn of hazardous conditions along east-facing shores due to large swells generated by the storm, which could cause life-threatening rip currents and beach erosion. The hurricane is expected to continue weakening as it moves through the region.</p>

          <p>An email sent by tournament organizers has reportedly asked broadcasters at the US Open men's final to refrain from showing any negative crowd reactions to President Donald Trump's attendance. The directive specifies that while he will be shown on screen during the national anthem, any subsequent disruptions or booing should not be aired. This measure follows a previous appearance in 2015 where Trump was booed by spectators, and it aims to manage the broadcast's portrayal of the politically charged atmosphere surrounding his presence at the event.</p>

          <p>The successful NFL game between the Chargers and Chiefs in São Paulo is being viewed as a blueprint for the league's long-term global expansion strategy. Rather than staging one-off events, the NFL aims to build a year-round presence in international markets to cultivate a dedicated global fanbase. The sold-out game at Corinthians Arena, with nearly 50,000 attendees, and a new media deal with Brazil's largest broadcaster, Globo, signal the league's serious commitment to making American football a major international sport.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at punishing foreign governments that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens. The order grants the State Department new authority to impose sanctions and other penalties by creating a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, similar to the existing state sponsor of terrorism list. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will face consequences, including potential economic sanctions and travel restrictions.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a major reshuffle of his government, with significant changes being made at the Home Office. Following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office, a new team of ministers has been appointed to work under the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood. The appointments are seen as a reflection of the prime minister's focus on tackling illegal immigration. The broader reshuffle includes promotions and moves across several other key government departments as Starmer seeks to reset his top team.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a volatile session as investors grappled with conflicting economic signals. A much weaker-than-expected August jobs report initially fueled hopes for an imminent interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, briefly pushing markets to all-time highs. However, this optimism was quickly replaced by concerns that the slowing labor market could signal a broader economic downturn, causing a market reversal. The day's trading highlighted the ongoing dilemma for investors balancing the benefits of potential monetary easing against the risks of weakening economic fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has denied having any knowledge of a classified 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, which was detailed in a New York Times report. The report, citing numerous anonymous sources, alleged that Trump had approved the mission to plant a surveillance device but that it was aborted after the SEALs killed several unarmed North Korean civilians whom they mistakenly perceived as a threat. When asked about the incident, Trump stated he was hearing about it for the first time, contradicting the report's claim of his direct approval.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has discontinued its security protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris. The decision comes after internal criticism that the assignment was diverting officers from their regular crime suppression duties. LAPD officers had been assisting the California Highway Patrol in protecting Harris after President Trump revoked her Secret Service detail. The Los Angeles police union had publicly criticized the move, arguing that a multimillionaire political figure should be responsible for funding her own private security.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the United States and Venezuela are escalating sharply following a U.S. military strike that destroyed a boat departing from the Venezuelan coast, killing all on board. The White House claimed the individuals were "narco-terrorists" linked to the Tren de Aragua crime group, a charge some experts question. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced the activation of millions of militiamen and condemned U.S. "imperialist policies," raising fears of a potential military confrontation in the Caribbean.</p>
