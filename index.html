          <h2>Pentagon Implements System for Hegseth to Access Signal Messages, Raising Security Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 17:35:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources revealed that the Pentagon established a system in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office enabling him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. This setup involves a monitor providing remote access to his personal cellphone, allowing him to check messages in a sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF) where cellphones are prohibited. Critics argue this workaround poses a security risk, granting Hegseth access to personal text messages and Signal chat groups at his desk. This news follows reports of Hegseth sharing details about U.S. airstrikes in Yemen via Signal, raising further questions about security practices within his office. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized judges accused of assisting undocumented immigrants, emphasizing that "no one is above the law."

Bondi dismissed accusations of intimidating judges who oppose the administration's immigration policies. These cases have sparked controversy, with some accusing the administration of overreach, while Bondi maintains the focus is on protecting citizens from violent criminals.</p>

          <p>Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca believes that Cole Palmer's recent lack of goals is due to mental rather than tactical or technical issues. Palmer, who previously scored 14 goals in 23 games, has gone 16 games without scoring, despite having the most shots in the Premier League during that period. Maresca notes that Palmer appears worried and eager to help the team, and reassures that the goals will come as the team continues to create opportunities. The manager emphasizes that Palmer's style, the team's approach, and the club environment remain unchanged.</p>

          <p>Irish hotelier Patrick McKillen filed a civil racketeering complaint against Qatari royals, alleging a "global scheme" to defraud him of millions for work on luxury properties, including the Maybourne Beverly Hills hotel.
