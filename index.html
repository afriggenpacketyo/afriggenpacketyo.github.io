          <p>The war between Israel and Iran has entered its ninth day, with continued missile exchanges between the two countries. Iran's foreign minister has cautioned against active U.S. military involvement, stating it would be dangerous for all parties. Diplomatic meetings in Geneva, New York, and Istanbul have failed to yield breakthroughs, even as President Trump considers joining Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities. The conflict has resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths and thousands of injuries in both Iran and Israel, according to various reports. Iranian missiles struck Haifa, Israel, with no major damage reported, while officials from Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation member countries meet to discuss the conflict's fallout. Optimism is low given the continued conflict and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>The second week of the Iran-Israel war began with strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility, prompting a warning against U.S. involvement from Iran's foreign minister. Israel's military confirmed targeting centrifuge production facilities and claimed to have killed three senior Iranian commanders, including one linked to the 2023 Hamas attack. Iran launched a new wave of drones and missiles at Israel, but damage was reportedly minimal due to Israel's air defenses. President Trump is considering U.S. military intervention, facing pressure to find a diplomatic solution; meanwhile, the conflict continues to intensify, with casualties rising in both countries and ongoing fighting in Gaza.</p>

Fowler undertook this journey to raise money to buy 100 BMX bicycles for underprivileged children, inspired by his own experience of finding solace in BMX after losing his father. He carried 60 pounds of gear and slept in various makeshift locations, performing comedy shows along the way, including an appearance on Netflix's "Kill Tony."

          <p>New court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who gave his wife a "bailout plan." Boelter is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. His wife told investigators they were preparing for major incidents, and he instructed her to go to her mother's home with their children.

          <p>Senior Israeli officials suggest that their military campaign against Iran could lead to the fall of the current regime, which would have substantial effects on the global oil market. While oil prices have increased by approximately 10% since the start of the Israeli attacks, they remain below $80 per barrel, as oil supplies have not yet been significantly disrupted. However, energy analysts warn that the risk of a supply disruption and subsequent price spike increases with the duration of the conflict. Regime change in major oil-producing countries has historically led to significant oil price increases, according to JPMorgan. (not investment advice)</p>

The Department of Homeland Security argues that Afghanistan's security situation has improved, but the State Department advises against travel there due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism.

          <p>The Trump administration has requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP), a move that could lead to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting with Washington. The request was reportedly made by U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby, who had previously urged Japan to raise spending to 3% of GDP. This increased demand may prompt Japan to call off the planned meeting of foreign and defense chiefs before the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>A review of Celine Song's film *Materialists* points out a troubling plotline involving sexual assault. The reviewer draws parallels to Paul Verhoeven's *Showgirls*, noting how both films use sexual assault as a plot device to propel the protagonist's emotional growth. In *Materialists*, a client of the protagonist, Lucy, is sexually assaulted, which is used to challenge Lucy's cynical approach to dating and love. While not as exploitative as *Showgirls*, the reviewer finds the use of trauma as a means of redemption oddly cynical for a film marketed as a rom-com.</p>

This finding underscores the pervasive problem of plastic pollution in marine ecosystems.
