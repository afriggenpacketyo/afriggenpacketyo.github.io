          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 04:48:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla shares experienced a significant decline in premarket trading following CEO Elon Musk's announcement of his intention to form a new political party, the "America Party." This venture into the political arena, aiming to influence a select number of legislative seats, has generated considerable investor apprehension, with analysts noting a broader sense of exhaustion among shareholders. They prefer Musk's focus to remain on Tesla's core business, especially amidst rising competition and a recent decline in car deliveries. This development highlights the market's sensitivity to the extracurricular activities of high-profile executives. Even former close ally Donald Trump has publicly criticized Musk's political initiative, labeling it "ridiculous" and suggesting Musk has gone "completely off the rails."</p>

          <h2>UK to Extend Bereavement Leave for Early Miscarriages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 04:33:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill, granting parents legal entitlement to bereavement leave for miscarriages occurring before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only available for losses after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. This significant change aims to provide crucial time for grieving, acknowledging pregnancy loss at any stage as a profound bereavement rather than just sick leave. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that no one experiencing such heartbreak should return to work before they are ready, a sentiment strongly supported by campaigners who have long advocated for this vital recognition in law.</p>

          <p>Former multiple world champion Ricky Hatton, aged 47, has announced his return to boxing after a 13-year retirement from the sport. He is set to fight the UAE's Eisa Al Dah in a middleweight bout on December 2 in Dubai. Hatton confirmed his comeback via livestream during a show promoted by Al Dah, despite accidentally injuring his eye with sunglasses, which prevented his in-person attendance at the announcement. Hatton expressed his excitement and assured fans the injury was not permanent, eagerly anticipating his return to the professional boxing ring after such a long hiatus.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a delay in the effective date of new tariffs until August 1, sparking confusion among importers and global markets. President Trump stated that letters dictating new tariff rates would be sent to trade partners, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarifying the August 1 implementation. This extends a previous 90-day pause set to expire on July 9, creating an extended period of uncertainty for businesses navigating international trade. The announcement led to slight dips in Asian stock markets and mixed reactions in European markets, reflecting ongoing concerns over the unpredictable nature of global trade policies and their economic impact.

          <p>Kenya's "Saba Saba" protests of July 7, 1990, are remembered as a pivotal moment when citizens defied autocratic rule to demand multi-party democracy and political accountability. Human rights activists and analysts highlight striking similarities between these historical demonstrations and the recent Gen Z-led protests of 2024-25, both driven by calls for better leadership, accountability, and an end to economic injustice and corruption. Despite government repression and violence, which saw over 50 people killed in mid-2024, the legacy of Saba Saba continues to inspire Kenyans to speak up and assert their power, illustrating a persistent struggle for human rights and democratic freedoms.</p>

          <p>Denmark, during its six-month EU Council presidency, is prioritizing the "green" agenda, despite a recent shift in European policy away from climate issues due to geopolitical realities and economic concerns. Climate and Energy Minister Lars Aagaard emphasizes framing the green transition as crucial for Europe's military independence and economic competitiveness, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. While ambitious EU emissions targets are enshrined in law, lower-profile green legislation faces challenges as some member states prioritize easing burdens on businesses. Denmark seeks to keep climate action moving by linking it to broader security and economic resilience, navigating skepticism from countries like Italy, Czechia, and Poland regarding ambitious emission cuts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps has initiated a pilot program with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to station ICE agents at three major military installations: Camp Pendleton, Marine Corps Base Quantico, and Marine Corps Base Hawaii. This collaboration aims to bolster security, particularly around base perimeters, and enhance "threat awareness" at critical access points and surrounding areas. The move follows high-profile incidents, including a 2023 breach attempt by Jordanian nationals at Quantico, one of whom was in the U.S. illegally. Critics, however, question the necessity and optics of involving ICE, suggesting it might imply the Marine Corps is not sufficiently handling its own security, potentially creating an "odd impression."</p>

In contrast, European chocolate, especially from Switzerland and Belgium, emphasizes fine taste and high quality, with stricter regulations on cocoa solids and fat content.

          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman, has been found guilty of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a Beef Wellington containing death cap mushrooms. After a nine-week trial and six days of deliberation, the jury rejected her defense that the deaths were an accident due to mistaken foraging. Prosecutors alleged Patterson deliberately tainted the meal and engaged in "calculated deceptions," including a fabricated cancer claim to lure guests and efforts to conceal evidence. The case, which captivated Australia and sparked multiple podcasts, now awaits her sentencing, with the verdicts requiring unanimous agreement from the jury.</p>

          <p>A 14-member team of UK engineers has arrived in India's Kerala to assess and repair a state-of-the-art British F-35B fighter jet, which has been stranded at Thiruvananthapuram airport for over three weeks. The $110 million jet, diverted due to bad weather and then reporting a technical snag, was unable to return to its carrier, HMS Prince of Wales. Its prolonged presence has generated public curiosity and jokes in India, making it a subject of memes. The team, equipped with specialist equipment, will determine if the advanced stealth jet can be repaired on-site or needs to be dismantled for transport.</p>

          <p>Despite French police employing tactics like wading into the water and slashing inflatable migrant boats in the English Channel, migrants continue to reach the UK at a record-setting pace. The article describes desperate attempts by individuals, including families with children, to make the perilous clandestine crossing from northern France. These direct interventions by French authorities, intended to deter crossings, literally deflate migrants' hopes and dreams. However, the ongoing influx highlights the persistent challenges in controlling irregular migration across one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, underscoring the complex humanitarian and security issues involved.</p>

          <p>China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is set to sustain production of its C919 aircraft and expand into foreign markets following the U.S. lifting its ban on selling American jet engine parts and technology. The agreement allows Comac to import components from a GE-invested joint venture, crucial for fulfilling hundreds of C919 orders as China does not yet mass-produce domestic engines. Analysts suggest that while this deal is vital for Comac's immediate growth and EU market ambitions, earlier U.S. export restrictions might still accelerate Beijing's resolve to develop indigenous aviation components.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the U.S. and meeting with President Donald Trump has sparked cautious optimism for a Gaza ceasefire. Trump expressed confidence in reaching a deal this week, while Netanyahu stated they are working towards an agreement under agreed conditions. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas resumed in Qatar on a U.S.-sponsored proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release. Despite ongoing challenges and Hamas's reservations, the recent war with Iran is seen as creating more favorable conditions for a breakthrough, with both leaders seemingly keen to move on to other regional priorities and Israeli public pressure for a deal growing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the world are experiencing an accelerating trend of declining birth rates, with women choosing to have fewer or no children. This shift is largely driven by increased female freedom and economic independence, along with the high costs of raising children. The global total fertility rate has reached a record low, with many high-income countries facing depopulation. While some view this as beneficial for the environment, it raises concerns about future workforces, economic growth, and social security viability. Policymakers are grappling with how to navigate these profound demographic shifts, which could reshape societies for decades.</p>

          <p>Europe faces a severe housing crisis, with soaring rents and unattainable home ownership, fueled significantly by the financial sector's increasing control over residential properties. Institutional investors, viewing housing as a lucrative "asset class," have tripled their purchases in the euro area, leading to rent hikes and displacement. This corporate capture, enabled by decades of privatization and liberalized mortgage credit, has undermined residents' power and exacerbated inequality. The crisis is now a major political issue, fueling far-right support and prompting calls for fundamental structural changes to reclaim housing from financial speculation and reinstate it as a core public priority.
