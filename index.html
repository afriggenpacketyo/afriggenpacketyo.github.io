          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Steady Interest Rates Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold steady its key interest rate, remaining within a range of 4.25%-4.5%, due to increasing uncertainty surrounding trade policies and a fluctuating economy. The FOMC's post-meeting statement acknowledged the heightened risks of both higher unemployment and inflation, indicative of potential stagflationary conditions, as President Trump's tariffs threaten to aggravate inflation and slow economic growth. While recent economic indicators present conflicting signals, the Fed remains patient in calibrating monetary policy, closely monitoring trade negotiations and their impact on growth, inflation, and market sentiment. Despite concerns, job growth remains solid, giving the Fed room to maneuver amidst economic uncertainties.</p>
