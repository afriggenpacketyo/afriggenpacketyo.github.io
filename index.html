        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC has decided not to appeal the libel case victory of former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, who sued the corporation over a 2016 BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight story and online article concerning the murder of British agent Denis Donaldson. A jury found that Mr. Adams was defamed by an anonymous contributor's allegation that he sanctioned the 2006 killing, awarding him €100,000 in damages. The combined legal costs for both parties are estimated to be between €3-5 million. The case centered around the interpretation of statements made in the broadcast and whether they implied Adams was directly involved in ordering the murder.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst escalating tensions, Israel launched a significant airstrike operation, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders, citing an imminent Iranian threat to its survival. In response, Iran launched missiles and drones towards Israel, which were largely intercepted, and promised further retaliation. The Israeli operation aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear ambitions and destabilize the regime, while Iran's response raised concerns about a wider regional conflict, potentially involving U.S. interests and proxies like the Houthis in Yemen. The strikes also cast doubt on the future of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, with Iran hinting at a withdrawal from negotiations and the situation could further escalate depending on how Iran chooses to respond. The event has prompted calls for de-escalation from NATO leaders. </p>

          <p>The United States military has become increasingly involved in the Middle East conflict following an attack on Iran, raising concerns about a wider regional war. The Trump administration has been hesitant to have more American military involvement in the Middle East, but the possibility of Iranian retaliation against US forces in the region is a major concern. The US military has a significant presence in the Middle East, with bases and personnel in several countries, making them potential targets for Iranian-backed militias. The situation is volatile and could escalate quickly, potentially drawing the US into a larger conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by Vox explores the potential for the United States to be drawn into the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, examining the Trump administration's initial reluctance and subsequent embrace of Israel's actions. While President Trump initially opposed the strikes, he later seemed to align himself with the operation, possibly hoping it would force Iran to make concessions in nuclear negotiations. The article considers scenarios where the U.S. could become more directly involved, particularly if Iran retaliates against American assets or if Israel requires U.S. military assistance to sustain its campaign. The analysis also assesses Iran's potential responses, including missile strikes, proxy attacks, and the possibility of targeting U.S. forces in the Middle East, and considers the domestic political implications for both Trump and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

          <p>A full-page advertisement in The New York Times, funded by Walmart heiress Christy Walton promoting a "No Kings" protest coinciding with a military parade, has triggered calls for a boycott of the retail giant. Supporters of President Trump have expressed outrage, despite Walmart clarifying that the ad is not endorsed by the company and represents Walton's personal views. The "No Kings" protest is scheduled for June 14, aiming to draw attention away from the Army's 250th Anniversary military parade in Washington, D.C. Walton's advertisement has reignited past tensions between Trump and Walmart, particularly after Walmart suggested tariffs would increase prices, leading Trump to suggest that they "eat the tariffs" instead.</p>

Discussions are underway to lower the cap on state and local tax deductions, and Senator Rand Paul is advocating for reduced border security funding. Medicaid changes remain an open question, and senators plan to review transferability of expiration dates for certain Inflation Reduction Act energy tax credits.

          <p>An 8 p.m. curfew imposed on downtown Los Angeles, following immigration enforcement demonstrations, has transformed the area into a virtual ghost town, impacting businesses and cultural institutions. Bars, restaurants, and theaters have been forced to close early, leading to revenue losses and canceled performances, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Seoul Festival. The curfew, intended to stem chaotic protests, has drawn criticism from business owners who feel unsupported by city leadership and are concerned about the economic impact. Despite the closures, some businesses are showing solidarity with the Latino community, promising to remain open as long as it's safe and acting as meeting places for the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores how the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel has reshaped Israel's strategic considerations regarding Iran, leading to recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military leadership. Several factors contributed to this shift, including Israel's successful campaign against Hezbollah, diminished fear of diplomatic repercussions, and President Trump's foreign policy approach. The author argues that the October 7 attacks, coupled with Netanyahu's domestic political challenges, created an environment where striking Iran became a viable option, despite long-standing hesitations. The analysis suggests that the timing of the strikes is not coincidental, and the events set in motion by Hamas have fundamentally altered Israel's military, diplomatic, and political landscape.</p>

          <p>Aiden Markram made a brilliant unbeaten century to put South Africa within tantalising distance of a historic victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood had shared a stand of 59 for Australia's last wicket in the morning session of day three which appeared to give them the upper hand. However, any frustration South Africa may have felt gave way to a sense of what might be possible in more appreciable conditions for batting after they were set a target of 282 for victory. Markram shared an unbroken 143-run partnership with South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma, who was hampered by a hamstring injury but tenaciously stayed at the crease to play his part with an unbeaten 65. The pair will resume on day four with 69 runs required to wrap up the win.</p>

          <p>Aiden Markram's unbeaten century has put South Africa within reach of a historic victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final. After Australia were dismissed for 207, setting a target of 282, Markram and Temba Bavuma forged an unbroken 143-run partnership. The pair will resume on day four needing 69 runs to secure the win, potentially ending South Africa's long wait for a major men's final victory. Australia's bowlers will need to summon a remarkable performance to prevent South Africa from achieving this milestone.</p>

          <p>Following the Air India crash in Ahmedabad, which claimed the lives of 241 passengers and crew, Indian authorities have launched an investigation with assistance from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and British investigators. The plane's flight data recorder has been recovered, and DNA testing is underway to identify victims burned beyond recognition. The crash, one of India's worst aviation accidents in decades, has prompted the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to order extra safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787 planes. Concerns have been raised about India's aviation safety culture and airport safety standards.</p>

          <p>The new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, previously linked to a surge of hospitalizations in Asia, could now account for over one-third of cases in the United States, according to CDC projections. While the CDC cautioned that the estimates have a wide margin of error, the variant's transmissibility is a concern, though data suggests it does not lead to more severe illness than previous strains. Symptoms are similar to earlier strains, including respiratory issues and systemic issues like fever and fatigue. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made moves to change access to vaccines, with the FDA requiring major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use and Kennedy indicating he will remove the CDC's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

          <p>DW reports on the global shortage of blood donors and the ongoing quest to create artificial, lab-made blood. While animal blood is theoretically possible through gene-editing, the complexities of altering blood cells to be compatible with the human immune system are immense. Scientists are exploring various methods, including genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood types with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. Researchers in Japan are also testing artificial hemoglobin harvested from unused blood bank reserves, with promising initial results. Despite progress, safe artificial blood production at scale remains years away, underscoring the continued importance of human blood donations.</p>

Gordon's song is deadpan funny and avoids some of the pitfalls that await many anti-Trump protest efforts.

The moves coincided with a softening in the heated rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, and the one-year inflation outlook tumbled to 5.1%.
