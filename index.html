          <p>Pete Buttigieg refuted President Trump's criticisms of his tenure as transportation secretary while visiting Iowa, a state pivotal to his 2020 presidential campaign. Buttigieg stated he is not currently running for any office, focusing instead on campaigning for values and ideas. Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have targeted Buttigieg over flight delays at Newark Airport, blaming him for failing to upgrade the air traffic control system, while Buttigieg emphasized his administration's efforts to grow the air traffic control workforce. Buttigieg also addressed questions about President Biden's cognitive state, stating that he always received what he needed from the West Wing, while also conceding that the Democratic party may have been better off if Biden had not run for re-election.

          <p>Despite public dismissals of food shortage warnings, an internal Israeli analysis reveals a looming crisis in Gaza due to blocked aid deliveries. Some Israeli military officials privately acknowledge that Palestinians face widespread starvation unless aid is restored within weeks. The analysis contrasts with Israel's public stance, which has maintained that the blockade posed no major threat to civilian life, and highlights the urgency of the situation, with bakeries and charity kitchens closing, and the World Food Program running out of supplies. The Trump administration is reportedly working with Israel on a plan involving private organizations distributing food under military perimeter security, a proposal dismissed by the U.N. due to safety concerns.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, setting the stage for their potential release after more than three decades behind bars for killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation through education and self-help groups as factors influencing his decision, but emphasized that the final decision rests with Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state parole board. The brothers apologized for their crimes, acknowledging the pain they caused their family, and expressed a desire to help others if released. The case, which has been the subject of numerous documentaries, has garnered sympathy from younger audiences who believe the brothers were mistreated by the justice system.

New UCLA chancellor Julio Frenk and athletic director Martin Jarmond outlined the department's financial challenges, including anticipated payouts to athletes, Olympic sports deficits, and revenue limitations at the Rose Bowl. Myers inquired about tangible ways to mitigate these issues, and Jarmond discussed potential solutions such as constructing premium seating at the Rose Bowl and renovating Pauley Pavilion. The school is also trying to contain costs by regionalizing nonconference schedules and hiring assistant coaches for head coaching positions.</p>

Critics view the effort as an attempt to intimidate workers from objecting to agency-wide downsizing, spearheaded by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency.

Consumer Watchdog criticized the move, citing State Farm's alleged mishandling of claims and refusal to open its books to justify the increase. The interim rate increase goes into effect on June 1, with a hearing scheduled for the fall to address State Farm's financial health.

          <p>Reports in the Mexican media suggest that U.S. authorities recently orchestrated the secret, cross-border move of at least 17 relatives of Mexico’s most notorious drug kingpin — Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán — to California. The transfer of El Chapo’s relatives is characterized as part of a “negotiation” between the U.S. Justice Department and representatives of one of El Chapo’s sons, Ovidio Guzmán López, who faces drug-smuggling and other charges in federal court in Chicago. There has been speculation in Mexico that, in exchange for a reduced prison term and other concessions, Ovidio Guzmán could agree to testify for the government in drug cases.</p>

Randle also noted similarities between Anthony Edwards and Bryant, praising Edwards' mentality, charisma, and leadership. Randle has emerged as a key player for the Timberwolves, averaging 24.3 points in four games against Golden State, and the Timberwolves are only a win away from a repeat trip to the Western Conference finals.</p>

Berkshire Hathaway, despite the upcoming departure of Warren Buffett, is built to last with nearly $350 billion in cash and a diverse portfolio of businesses. Constellation Brands, with a low forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio and a growing dividend, is also considered a strong investment.

Judge Michael Jesic gave the brothers a new sentence of 50 years to life, and the pair will now have to argue for their release in front of the state's parole board. The brothers acknowledged killing Kitty and Jose Menendez, but said they acted out of self-defense after years of abuse. Prosecutors argued the brothers planned the shotgun killings to access their parents' fortune and should not be released.</p>

Dr. Gurpreet Khaira remains conflicted, acknowledging the importance of choice but worrying about vulnerable patients being coerced into assisted dying.

          <p>Concerns are growing about the survival of traditional British television in the face of competition from US streaming giants. Some suggest consolidation of UK broadcasters or a shared streaming platform to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney Plus. Others argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers, and the industry is attempting to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV. There is a debate over whether the BBC iPlayer could become the portal for other British public service media content, but commercial broadcasters would likely not entertain the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer.</p>

The book reveals the Democratic Party remains unwilling to publicly reckon with its choice to back Biden for as long as it did, even after their devastating defeat. The most powerful people in the party either made a colossal misjudgment of the situation or recognized the problem yet declined to press Mr. Biden or the White House about it.
