          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the sugar tax to include milkshakes and lattes, potentially impacting a significant portion of pre-packed milk-based drinks. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized the move, while health advocates welcomed it as a step towards tackling obesity. The government is also proposing to reduce the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies. The Food and Drink Federation acknowledged the consultation and highlighted the industry's efforts to reduce sugar content in recent years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Formula 1 is set to change its regulations in 2026, primarily driven by a desire to attract new engine manufacturers. The new rules retain 1.6-liter V6 turbo hybrids but simplify them by removing the MGU-H and increasing electrical capacity. This has led to Audi's entry and Ford's partnership with Red Bull, with Honda staying and General Motors entering in 2029. The changes may initially open up the field but are expected to close again, providing an opportunity for a shake-up in the competitive order.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, India has renewed claims of Pakistan's involvement, citing "cross-border linkages." India points to Pakistan's past support for militant groups, while Pakistan denies involvement and calls for an international investigation. The roots of the Kashmir conflict trace back to the 1947 partition, with both countries claiming the territory. India has presented evidence of Pakistani support for militancy in the past, but has not yet provided similar evidence for the recent attack.</p>

          <p>One of Prince Andrew's business assets, Pitch@Palace Global, was administered for two years by a company controlled by Doug Barrowman, a controversial millionaire. Barrowman and his wife, Baroness Michelle Mone, have faced scrutiny over their links to a company that won government contracts during the Covid pandemic.

          <p>Deliveroo, a food delivery app, is preparing to be taken over by DoorDash, marking a disappointing end to its time on the stock market. The company's shares have struggled since its initial public offering, trading at less than a third of their listing price. The board's decision to accept the takeover bid is seen as an admission of failure after investors were misled about the company's prospects. The company's debut was considered the worst in London's history, wiping out billions in market capitalization. (not investment advice)</p>
