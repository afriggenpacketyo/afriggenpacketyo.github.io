          <p>A two-ton elephant seal surprised residents of Gordon's Bay, South Africa, when it wandered into a residential area. The seal, identified as a young male, was seen lumbering along a street, prompting a rescue effort involving police, a security company, and animal welfare officials. After being contained and sedated, the seal was safely transported back to a nearby bay. The Cape of Good Hope SPCA noted that southern elephant seals are not commonly found in South Africa, making this "unexpected journey" a rare event, which required careful coordination to ensure everyone's safety.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has voiced increasing frustration with Vladimir Putin's intensified strikes on Kyiv, marking a shift from his previous stance of maintaining a good relationship with the Russian president. Trump warned Putin was "playing with fire" and indicated he might consider imposing new sanctions on Russia, although he deflected when asked about specific consequences. Analysts suggest that Trump's comments may influence the U.S. attitude toward future sanctions or aid to Ukraine, especially after Putin rejected the Vatican as a location for peace talks, though Trump has previously promised to end the war on Day 1 in office.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is partnering with Telegram in a deal worth $300 million to roll out its Grok chatbot on the messaging platform. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced that Telegram users will gain access to the best AI technology on the market this summer, and the platform will also earn 50% of the revenue from xAI subscriptions sold on Telegram. This move comes as Telegram faces scrutiny in France, where Durov is under investigation for allegedly allowing criminal activity on the platform, and after xAI's Grok chatbot faced criticism for generating controversial responses related to the topic of "white genocide" in South Africa.</p>

The hub aims to improve situational awareness, information sharing, and real-time monitoring of potential threats. The EU hopes to foster closer collaboration with Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in trade, energy, and transport cooperation.

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his conflict with Harvard University, accusing it of disrespecting the country and alleging antisemitism. Trump claims Harvard is losing significant funding due to his policies and has criticized the school for enrolling too many foreign students, suggesting a cap of 15%. He also dismissed criticism from Jewish students protesting the government's actions, reiterating claims of antisemitism at Harvard and other elite institutions. The administration has demanded information on international students and revoked the school's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, leading to legal challenges.</p>

Other "Survivor" alums, including Angela Keeley, Kara Kay, Natalie Cole, Carl Boudreaux, and Christian Hubicki, have also made cameo appearances as guests in various seasons.

          <p>President Donald Trump's executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. by late 2030, according to GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. Trump's orders aim to expedite the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) approval process for new nuclear plants. GE Vernova recently received approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, and the Tennessee Valley Authority has applied to build a GE Vernova reactor at Oak Ridge, Tenn. Strazik believes customer interest in SMRs is high due to their carbon-free emissions.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is planning a significant expansion in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) amid slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company aims to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030, which could change based on regulations and customer acceptance. This strategy comes as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and aim to meet federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations. Toyota plans to improve the electric-only range of its PHEVs and is assessing where to build them based on product strength and competition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has stated that she would grant bail to Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist employed by Harvard University, in an immigration case stemming from her failure to declare scientific samples she was carrying into the country. Judge Christina Reiss said there seemed to be no factual or legal basis for the immigration officer's actions in stripping Petrova of her visa and that Petrova's life and well-being were in peril if she was deported to Russia. Petrova has admitted that she failed to declare the samples, with her lawyer arguing that this would ordinarily be treated as a minor infraction.</p>

Chief executive Omar Berrada said the club had a vision for what they wanted to achieve and that they were ready for all the different scenarios.

          <p>A new study by Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that domestic cats can differentiate between the smell of their owner and that of a stranger. The study found that cats spent significantly more time sniffing tubes containing the odours of unknown people compared to tubes containing their owner's smell, indicating they can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on odour. Researchers suggest cats use their strong sense of smell to identify and communicate with other cats, and this may extend to people. The researchers cautioned that the cats can't be concluded to identify specific people such as their owner.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the U.S., but education experts say the process faces significant obstacles. Federal grants are typically awarded to research universities for specific purposes, such as scientific research, which trade schools are not equipped to undertake. Experts argue that redirecting funds requires evidence that Harvard's grants were not awarded based on merit, and that the administration would need to follow a prescribed process. While trade schools can compete for federal grants, they generally lack the faculty, staff, and facilities for scientific or medical research.</p>
