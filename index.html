          <h2>Experimental Off-Label Drug Shows Promise in Aiding Speech for Some Children with Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 14:09:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, an inexpensive drug typically used for chemotherapy side effects, as a potential treatment for some children with autism. The theory suggests it bypasses a blockage of folic acid transport to the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues. In preliminary trials, the drug has shown positive effects on speech development for a subset of children, as exemplified by a nonverbal boy who began speaking shortly after starting the off-label treatment. However, scientists emphasize that more extensive research is needed to secure FDA approval and address challenges like inconsistent generic drug quality and lack of financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in further studies.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has received its first family under a new "one in, one out" asylum agreement with France, a pilot program intended to deter illegal Channel crossings. Under the treaty, for each migrant returned to France who arrived by small boat, the UK will accept a refugee with a valid protection case who has not made the crossing. The scheme has faced criticism from both political opponents, who call it an ineffective deterrent, and human rights groups, who advocate for more comprehensive safe routes for asylum seekers. This development occurs as the total number of small boat crossings this year has slightly decreased compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly shifted his position on the Russia-Ukraine war, suggesting Ukraine is now capable of winning back all its territory. This marks a significant departure from his previous skepticism and suggestions that Kyiv would need to concede land for peace. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and called Trump a "game changer," expressing cautious optimism about the pivot. While some Ukrainian officials welcomed the change, others remain skeptical, emphasizing that concrete actions and continued military support are more important than rhetoric.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, prospective homebuyers are advised to carefully evaluate the current housing market before making a purchase. This article suggests that buyers should first determine the actual mortgage rate they qualify for, as it can vary significantly based on credit score and lender. It is also important to explore alternatives that could secure a lower rate, such as paying for mortgage points or considering an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). Finally, buyers must weigh the risk of waiting for rates to drop further against the possibility that they could rise again, as has happened in the recent past.</p>

          <p>A growing number of retired professional athletes and coaches are entering the political arena by running for seats in the U.S. Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Notable candidates include former Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, who is running in Texas, and former college football coach Derek Dooley, who is seeking a Senate seat in Georgia. While these candidates may benefit from name recognition, a successful sports career does not guarantee victory at the ballot box, as demonstrated by several recent unsuccessful campaigns by other high-profile athletes.

          <p>U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is scrutinizing Rolex after the luxury watchmaker hosted President Donald Trump in its corporate box at the US Open. In a letter to the company's CEO, Warren questioned whether the invitation was an attempt to "curry favor" with the administration to gain exemptions from steep new tariffs imposed on Swiss exports. The timing is considered concerning, given the president's history of granting special treatment to companies that appeal to him. The White House dismissed the inquiry as an "asinine conspiracy theory," while Rolex has not yet commented on the matter.</p>

Department of Homeland Security officials condemned the attack, linking it to heated political rhetoric against the agency. This event follows other recent security threats at ICE facilities in Texas, prompting calls from lawmakers for an end to politically motivated violence against law enforcement.</p>

Trump also claimed the UK had abandoned its "powerful edge" in North Sea oil due to high taxes, despite data showing that 90% of future production will come from existing fields.

Critics argue the spending is a wasteful use of public funds, while the investigation also shed light on poor living conditions and exploitation within the for-profit asylum accommodation system.

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, homeowners considering an $80,000 home equity loan can expect slightly lower monthly payments compared to earlier this year. Based on current average rates, a 10-year loan would cost approximately $989 per month, while a 15-year loan would be around $779 per month. While the monthly savings are modest, they can add up to a significant amount over the life of the loan.

This parallel diplomacy underscores a persistent competition for influence between the world's two most populous countries, even as they have recently shown signs of improving their strained relationship. Both nations are vying to be the primary voice for the developing world.</p>

          <p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairperson Brendan Carr is facing criticism for pressuring Disney to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel over comments he made regarding the assassination of a right-wing activist. Critics argue that Carr's actions, which he threatened on a hard-right podcast, represent a calculated use of government power to silence political speech and fulfill an authoritarian agenda. This move is seen as a direct implementation of policies outlined in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook, which Carr co-authored. The incident has turned Kimmel into a symbol of free speech and exposed the hypocrisy of conservative claims of being victims of censorship.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. surged by a much greater than expected 20.5% in August, reaching their highest pace since early 2022. This significant one-month gain occurred even before mortgage rates began to fall in September, suggesting strong underlying demand. However, some analysts urge caution, noting that the new home sales data is often volatile and subject to large revisions. While builder incentives likely played a role in the increase, the median price of a new home also rose, indicating a complex and dynamic housing market.</p>

          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has issued an apology to his supporters for the "confusion" and public infighting that has plagued the launch of his new political party, currently named "Your Party." The apology comes after a bitter public dispute with fellow MP Zarah Sultana over the unauthorized launch of a membership portal, which led to accusations of a "sexist boys' club." Corbyn announced that an official membership system is now open and promised that the new venture would be grassroots-led, with members making key decisions ahead of a planned founding conference in November.</p>

Walters framed the move as a necessary measure to combat "radical leftist" and "woke indoctrination" allegedly pushed by teachers unions. The initiative, which follows the recent killing of Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk, has been met with controversy. Walters has threatened to challenge the accreditation of any school district that refuses to allow a chapter, while some educators have expressed concern over the mandatory nature of the plan.</p>

          <p>The UK government has once again delayed the announcement of its plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail, a key high-speed rail project intended to connect Liverpool and Manchester. The delay is reportedly due to an extended review of the project's long-term costs, as officials seek to avoid the budget overruns and problems that have plagued the HS2 line. The decision pushes back a highly anticipated revival of the infrastructure plan, which is aimed at boosting economic growth across the north of England. The repeated postponements have caused frustration among northern mayors and business leaders.</p>

They are known for their vibrant pink color and primarily prey on the much smaller and more common moon jellyfish.
