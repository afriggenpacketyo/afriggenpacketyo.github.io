          <p>Armed gangs have killed dozens of people in two suspected attacks in northeast Nigeria, according to a local governor and villagers. The attacks occurred in the villages of Munga and Magani, resulting in numerous fatalities and property destruction. The governor condemned the violence and assured that security measures have been activated to prevent further incidents. Northeastern Nigeria has been plagued by violence in recent weeks, with armed gangs and Islamist groups increasing their attacks in the region. The area has been ravaged by a 16-year insurgency, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of two million people. </p>

          <p>Jorge Humberto Figueroa, a leader of a notorious Mexican drug cartel with a $1 million U.S. bounty on his head, was killed in a clash with army troops. Figueroa, known as "El Perris," was wanted by the DEA for fentanyl trafficking and money laundering. He was a mastermind of the 2019 clash in Culiacan, where cartel members fought for the release of Ovidio Guzman, son of "El Chapo." Figueroa belonged to a Sinaloa cartel faction run by Guzman's sons, who are fighting another faction led by heirs of Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada.

          <p>The government is planning new rules that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to complete projects in a timely manner. These measures are part of a broader plan to address the housing crisis, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Developers will be required to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports to councils. Those who repeatedly fail to meet targets could face penalties, including losing land and paying thousands of pounds per unbuilt home to local planning authorities. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the 2025 graduates of West Point with a speech that veered into politically charged territory, discussing DEI programs, immigration, and historical figures. He highlighted his administration's efforts to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, stating that the military's job is to dominate foes and spread democracy, not host drag shows. Trump praised his administration's crackdown on immigration and shared anecdotes about golfer Gary Player and real estate developer William Levitt. He also compared the investigations he faced to those of Al Capone. The speech concluded with Trump heading to his golf club in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was wrongfully deported to Mexico, despite his fears of harm. The man, who is gay, had applied for asylum after facing homophobic violence in Guatemala and presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom in Mexico. Judge Brian Murphy found the deportation likely lacked due process, as the man risked persecution or torture if returned. The order adds to a series of court findings against recent deportations by the Trump administration. </p>

The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship during exercises and was lost until 1972.

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis to undermine Hamas. The plan involves foreign contractors distributing aid, displacing experienced agencies like the U.N. Israeli officials proposed hiring private contractors to bypass the U.N., which they accuse of anti-Israeli bias. The plan aims to prevent food from falling into militants' hands and move distribution to Israeli-controlled zones. The U.N. warns the plan could restrict aid, endanger civilians, and facilitate displacement.

          <p>French authorities suspect arson in a major power outage that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival. The outage, affecting 160,000 households, was caused by a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes and a collapsed high-voltage line. Laurent Hottiaux, the prefect for the area, condemned the acts and mobilized resources to find the perpetrators. Power was restored hours before the closing ceremony, and the festival proceeded as planned using an independent power supply. Traffic lights and shops were affected during the outage, causing disruptions in Cannes and surrounding areas.</p>
