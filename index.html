            <p>Christians in Nigeria face a dire Easter as violence from Islamist militants continues, particularly in the Middle Belt region, where Fulani extremists seek to displace Christian communities. Reports indicate numerous attacks, including massacres and the burning of homes, with little government intervention to protect the Christian population. International Christian Concern is urging the U.S. State Department to designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern, calling for sanctions and a halt to aid until the attacks are addressed and lands are restored.</p>

            <p>A report from the Atlantic Council cautions the United States against complacency in the global technology competition with China, warning that developing countries will play an increasingly critical role. The report emphasizes the need for the U.S. to actively engage with the Global South to maintain its technological foothold and prevent China from dominating global technological norms. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are expected to negatively impact developing countries, potentially pushing them closer to China.</p>

            <p>A former member of the Deepwater Horizon inquiry commission warns that the Trump administration's cuts to science, environmental, and safety agencies are dangerously undermining decades of progress. Drawing parallels to the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon disasters, the author argues that weakening regulations and slashing funding will inevitably lead to future environmental catastrophes. The administration's claims of restoring efficiency are dismissed as misleading, with the true cost being shifted onto communities and ordinary Americans through habitat destruction and economic devastation.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's recent actions against Harvard University, including freezing grants, represent a continuation of conservative efforts to undermine and control higher education. Harvard refused to comply with demands that would have given the government control over hiring, admissions, and curriculum, which the university president deemed a violation of academic freedom. Experts view this as part of a broader authoritarian playbook to suppress dissent and critical thinking within universities, echoing historical efforts like McCarthyism.</p>

            <p>An analysis suggests that the U.S. is ill-prepared for a trade war with China, potentially strengthening China's geopolitical position and weakening the U.S. economy. China's dominance in key industries and its strategic preparations give it an advantage, while the Trump administration's confrontational approach with allies undermines potential coalitions. The article suggests that public tolerance for economic pain will determine the outcome, but voters' appetite for punishing China may not outweigh the impact of rising prices and economic slowdown.</p>

            <p>Carole Cadwalladr, reflecting on her experience being sued for a TED Talk, warns that technology is now politics and that democracy is threatened by the alignment of Silicon Valley and autocracy. Speaking directly to Silicon Valley leaders, she accuses them of complicity in a regime of fear and cruelty and criticizes the naivety of the British government in the face of U.S. tech power. She urges collective action to rebuild the information system and resist the concentration of power in the hands of a few reckless men.</p>
