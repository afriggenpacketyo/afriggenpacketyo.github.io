        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for Singapore Airlines dropped over 8% after the company reported a 59% decrease in net profit for its first quarter. The airline attributed the decline to lower interest income and losses from its associates, particularly its 25.1% stake in Air India. Analysts note that Air India's losses were deeper than expected and are likely to be a near-term drag on SIA's finances. Despite the profit plunge, SIA stated that demand for air travel remains strong, though some investment banks have downgraded the stock, citing weaker cargo demand and higher operating costs.

          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Midtown Manhattan office building, killing four people, including 36-year-old NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, used an M4 rifle in the attack. Officer Islam, a four-year veteran and immigrant from Bangladesh, was praised as a hero who leaves behind a pregnant wife and two young sons. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, and authorities believe the shooter acted alone.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants arrested by ICE while their deportation cases are pending. This reverses a long-standing practice of allowing release on bond for those not considered a flight or safety risk. Advocates argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing severe harm to families. The lawsuit highlights cases of long-term US residents with strong community ties, including a single mother and cancer survivor, who are now indefinitely detained.</p>

The deal imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports while eliminating tariffs on American goods exported to the EU. Analysts at Capital Economics forecast the deal could reduce the EU's annual GDP by 0.2%, while the Trump administration claims it will boost U.S. manufacturing and exports. The EU also committed to large purchases of U.S. energy and significant investments, a move seen as a concession to avoid even higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two senior officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division, Roger Alford and Bill Rinner, have been fired following reports of internal friction within the office. Both were top deputies to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater and had previously served during President Trump's first term. While the specific reason for the dismissals was cited as insubordination, it comes amid tensions over the division's handling of major investigations into companies like T-Mobile and Capital One. The firings suggest ongoing conflict within the administration's monopoly-fighting arm over its enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to play this season after the organization denied his waiver for a final year of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer who has played at four colleges since 2019, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive. The lawsuit claims the denial will cause him irreparable harm, costing him a significant NIL opportunity and a chance to enhance his career at a major program. The case follows similar legal challenges where courts have granted athletes additional seasons of eligibility.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's lackluster response to the new U.S.-EU trade agreement is due to investors focusing on more immediate factors. He argues that Wall Street currently has "tariff ennui" and is more preoccupied with this week's major tech earnings reports, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data. Cramer suggests that until these key events pass, trade policy news will have little impact on market movement. He also noted that with major deals still pending with China, Canada, and Mexico, the trade narrative is far from over. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is considering the constitutionality of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics after a lower court blocked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" in Southern California. The initial ruling found that agents were violating the 4th Amendment by using criteria like race, language, or location as a pretext for detentions without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department is appealing the block, arguing it usurps federal authority, while civil rights groups contend the injunction is necessary to prevent widespread constitutional violations.</p>

Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, was found to have bribed witnesses to give false testimony in an investigation into his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case, which could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years, dates back to 2012. Uribe has maintained his innocence, claiming the proceedings are politically motivated.</p>

This reliance on media imagery can attune him to public opinion but also makes him susceptible to manipulation and misinformation. The article argues that this narrow information stream, combined with a distrust of experts, creates policy whiplash and presents a danger in an age of convincing deepfakes, as he naively believes you "can't fake" what is on TV.</p>
