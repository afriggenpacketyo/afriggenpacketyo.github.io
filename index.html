          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning to Chinese citizens to be wary of foreigners who may be spies disguised as scholars, tourists, businesspeople, consultants, or even romantic partners. The agency advised citizens not to be fooled by sweet talk and to avoid disclosing sensitive information. The warning also highlighted the possibility of foreign agents approaching Chinese students abroad, pretending to be like-minded friends to recruit them through romantic relationships. The ministry urged the public to report any suspicious individuals or activities to national security authorities.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in rice prices under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, who replaced Taku Eto after Eto made controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The survey also revealed that 44.7% of respondents believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a lower target than Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's pledge. Additionally, 42.2% felt that the removal of the previous farm minister should have occurred sooner, while the approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet rose slightly to 31.7%.</p>

          <p>The Texas House has granted initial approval to Senate Bill 8, which requires sheriffs to collaborate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by serving federal immigration warrants at local jails. The bill, amended to apply to all counties, necessitates sheriffs to request partnerships with ICE, known as 287(g) agreements, allowing local authorities to perform certain immigration enforcement tasks. The legislation also permits the Texas attorney general to sue sheriffs who do not comply and offers grants to offset participation costs. Immigrants' rights advocates argue the bill could lead to racial profiling and deter undocumented individuals from reporting crimes.</p>

This pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes enhanced allowances for SDF members and aims to address a recruitment shortage. The move also comes amid recent scandals that have affected public trust in the SDF, even as the government seeks to bolster the nation's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing on time from Woking to Surbiton. The government has called this a "new dawn for rail" but has refrained from promising lower fares, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. The trains are now the responsibility of the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), though GBR will not officially exist until MPs vote to create it. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that she will ensure customers get good value for money.</p>

          <p>The European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China regarding electric vehicles, leading to a debate about whether Chinese investment in the sector can be a job creator or an industry killer.

Windrose Technology aims to produce 4,000 electric trucks annually in France starting in 2027 and is considering a U.S. plant, with plans to list on a U.S. stock exchange and a secondary listing in France.</p>

          <p>Sir Alan Bates, a former subpostmaster and advocate for victims of the Post Office scandal, has stated that the government's compensation offer amounts to less than half of his claim. He accused ministers of running "quasi-kangaroo courts" and altering the "goal posts" on their judgements, adding that promises of a "non-legalistic" compensation scheme have proven "worthless." The Department for Business and Trade has responded, stating that they aim to give the benefit of the doubt to postmasters and that anyone unhappy with their offer can have their case reviewed by a panel of experts independent of the government. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 subpostmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to the faulty Horizon IT system.</p>

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found fragments of the virus in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, though there have been no reported human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date. Prof Ball explained that the virus primarily affects birds and mosquitoes, with occasional transmission to humans causing mild symptoms in most cases, but severe disease in a small percentage.</p>

          <p>North Korean authorities have detained three shipyard officials following the unsuccessful launch of a naval destroyer, an event attended by leader Kim Jong Un. The incident, which resulted in damage to the ship's stern, has been described by Kim as a "criminal act" caused by carelessness. Despite the setback, North Korea maintains that the damage is not severe and that repairs will be completed within 10 days. The launch was intended to bolster North Korea's naval capabilities, but the failure has raised concerns about the country's shipbuilding expertise.</p>

While the government touts its trade deal successes, cost-of-living pressures and rising business taxes continue to worry voters. Some analysts suggest that Starmer's leadership style and lack of charisma compared to figures like Nigel Farage contribute to his unpopularity.</p>
