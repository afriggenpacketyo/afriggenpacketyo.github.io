          <p>Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan, co-creator of "Father Ted," testified in court that his life has been made "hell" by transgender activists. He is on trial for allegedly harassing an 18-year-old activist, Sophia Brooks, on social media and damaging her phone, charges he denies. Linehan claims his actions were aimed at exposing what he describes as the activist's "misogynistic" and "abusive" behavior, stating the trial is the latest attempt to punish him for his views on gender identity.</p>

This boom highlights the strategic value of DraftKings' acquisition of Jackpocket, which it uses to cross-sell customers to its sports betting and iGaming offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Reform UK gains political momentum, its economic plans are facing increased scrutiny regarding their feasibility. The party's proposals, including £88 billion in annual tax cuts and significant spending increases, rely heavily on saving £30 billion a year by scrapping net zero policies, a figure disputed by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Analysts, such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, have expressed skepticism, suggesting that the party's claimed £50 billion in savings from government waste would likely require substantial cuts to public services to be realized.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A winner of the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot would face a substantial tax bill, significantly reducing the take-home amount. The lump sum cash option of $826.4 million would be immediately reduced by a mandatory 24% federal withholding, or about $198.3 million. However, the final federal tax rate for such a high income would be 37%, meaning millions more would be owed to the IRS, in addition to potential state taxes depending on the winner's location.

Winners in states with no lottery tax, like California and Florida, would take home substantially more of the $1.8 billion jackpot compared to those in high-tax states like New York. The data also highlights that the current jackpot run is the longest in the game's history without a winner, as it reaches its 42nd consecutive drawing.</p>

This slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty and the Trump administration's tariffs, increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for abusing its dominant position in the online advertising technology market. Regulators found that Google illegally favored its own display advertising services, harming rival providers, advertisers, and online publishers. This penalty is the latest in a series of major fines against the tech giant, which also faced penalties in the U.S. and France this week for privacy and data collection issues, though Google has stated it will appeal the EU's decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved legislation that raises the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had limited the deduction to $10,000, a move that disproportionately affected taxpayers in high-tax states. While proponents argue the increase mitigates double taxation, critics point to the fiscal impact, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.

          <p>Angela Rayner's resignation marks a dramatic end to a remarkable political career that saw her rise from a working-class background to become deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom. Having left school at 16, she built a career through the trade union movement before becoming a powerful figure in the Labour Party. Her combative style and compelling personal story made her a key political asset, but her fall from power over a tax error underscores the intense scrutiny faced by those at the highest levels of government.</p>

Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer questioned why Powell was waiting to act, and President Trump stated he should have lowered rates "long ago." With job growth slowing significantly, investors now see a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting as a near certainty, shifting the focus to how the central bank will signal its policy.
