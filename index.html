          <p>Iran has declared it will not resume nuclear talks while under attack, following Israel's warning of a prolonged conflict. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, who urged diplomatic efforts with the US. Israel's Defense Minister Eyal Zamir stated the country should prepare for a prolonged campaign, with reports of explosions near Tel Aviv and missile interceptions over Israel. A 16-year-old was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike on Qom, with Iranian officials insisting their nuclear program is peaceful and that they reserve the right to self-defense, adding that defense capabilities are non-negotiable. The article concludes with Donald Trump giving Iran a maximum of two weeks to avoid possible US air strikes. Optimism is tempered by the rising tensions and potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat to Argentina, exposing issues with team cohesion. Despite showing ambition and creating opportunities in attack, their execution was lacking, with offloads and passes frequently missing their mark. Two-time Lion Tadhg Beirne noted the world-class caliber of the players, but the team struggled to find a rhythm in their first 80 minutes together. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration, citing compounded errors that prevented the team from dictating the game's pace, adding that the team will need to be sharper when they reach Australian shores.</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged slump, exacerbated by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in urban cities will remain suppressed, falling to a quarter of its 2017 peak. The country's population is expected to decrease to below 1.39 billion by 2035, further reducing housing demand by an estimated 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million units in the 2030s. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes, job instability, and a weak social security system continue to discourage young people from having more children, limiting the effectiveness of pronatalist policies.

Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53 percent increase from 2016.

The Japan Coast Guard confirmed that four Chinese ships equipped with autocannons sailed in the contiguous zone outside Japan's territorial waters and warned them not to approach.

Despite facing criticism for his handling of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack and ongoing domestic political challenges, a majority of Israelis support his decision to strike Iran. While some view the attacks as politically motivated, many believe Netanyahu genuinely aims to eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. However, critics argue that his actions are driven by a desire to consolidate power and distract from his legal troubles, but the first strike echoed Israel’s greatest military victory, the six-day war of 1967.</p>

The game was a meeting of boisterous, alpha clubs, distant cousins on Bavaria-La Plata continuum: domestic powerhouses, rousing music, regional meat culture. Miguel Merentiel scored a stunning solo goal for Boca Juniors, but Michael Olise secured the win for Bayern with a late goal, adding that Bayern can rest and tend to their bruises for the final group game against Porto.</p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, who spent months in custody due to "foreign policy" concerns, addressed reporters after leaving the facility, stating that the Trump administration chose the wrong person to target. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, and his bail conditions restrict his travel to select states. His wife expressed relief, while the White House indicated it would appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A judge dismissed all charges against Barry Morphew, without prejudice, just days before he was set to stand trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to discovering Suzanne's body. The dismissal follows numerous twists in the case, including judicial sanctions against the prosecution for failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence. Morphew's attorney maintained his innocence and criticized the prosecution for manufacturing a murder case, but investigators continue searching for Suzanne's body.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security had previously revoked Harvard's student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism. The university sued, arguing it was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda. Trump hinted that a settlement is being discussed, but the battle over international students could have grave consequences for Harvard.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has approved legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now heads to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports such bans, and would make Rhode Island the eleventh state with similar prohibitions. The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, and aims to prevent residents from purchasing them in other states. Critics argue that the ban will do little to curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
