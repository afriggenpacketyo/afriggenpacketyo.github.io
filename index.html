        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on imported auto parts is anticipated to significantly raise the prices of new and used vehicles, as well as repair and insurance costs, as noted in the article. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, the broader impact is expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and contribute to overall inflation. Automakers, including General Motors and Volvo, are expected to be hit harder than others, like Tesla and Ford. The uncertainty surrounding trade policy is creating headaches for carmakers, with GM estimating costs of up to $5 billion this year. \n</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australia's prime minister, marking a historic win for the Labor Party, according to the article. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging the cost-of-living crisis and energy policy as major campaign issues. Albanese emphasized improved relations with China and criticized the opposition's attempt to mimic U.S. President Trump's politics. The U.S. Secretary of State congratulated Albanese, underscoring the strong alliance between the two countries, while both campaigns focused on Australia's changing demographics and policies to assist first-home buyers amid international economic uncertainty generated by Trump's tariff policies.</p>

Voters' concerns centered on living costs and housing availability in one of the world's most expensive cities. Wong's government has cautioned about a potential recession due to higher tariffs on exports to the U.S. and any downturn in global trade.</p>
