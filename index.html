          <p>Catastrophic flooding in central Texas has resulted in a death toll of at least 70 people, according to state officials. In response to the disaster, President Trump has signed a Major Disaster Declaration for the hard-hit Kerr County, enabling the deployment of federal resources. The Department of Homeland Security has activated the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with recovery efforts. The U.S. Coast Guard is also actively involved in search-and-rescue operations, utilizing aircraft with thermal cameras to locate survivors amid the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <h2>Catastrophic Texas Floods Highlight Challenges of Extreme Weather Forecasting</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The devastating flash floods in Texas are highlighting the severe limitations of forecasting extreme weather events in the era of climate change. Despite the National Weather Service issuing timely warnings, the rainfall's intensity, with over 10 inches in three hours, far exceeded predictions and overwhelmed the region. This event underscores the difficulty in pinpointing the exact location and magnitude of such historic downpours, a challenge exacerbated by staffing shortages at key federal agencies. The tragedy serves as a stark example of a complex climate disaster becoming more frequent.</p>

          <h2>Wimbledon Match Disrupted by Electronic Line-Calling System Failure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 13:09:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was temporarily halted due to a significant failure in the electronic line-calling system. The system failed to make an audio call on a crucial point, leading to confusion and a decision by the chair umpire to replay the point, which frustrated Pavlyuchenkova. She argued that the umpire should have made the call himself, as the ball was visibly out. The incident, attributed to operator error, has sparked debate about the reliability of the new technology and the procedures in place for such malfunctions.</p>

          <p>In a joint declaration, leaders of the BRICS nations have condemned recent military strikes on Iran while strategically avoiding any direct mention of the United States or Israel. The statement expresses 'grave concern' over the attacks and calls for an urgent de-escalation of violence to restore peace in the Middle East. While the declaration advocates for a two-state solution for Palestine, it also directly criticizes Israel for its occupation of Palestinian territory and its continued presence in Syria's Golan Heights. This diplomatic language reflects the bloc's complex geopolitical positioning amid rising regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen has introduced its new autonomous vehicle, the ID. Buzz van, which is engineered for driverless fleet operations rather than individual ownership. The vehicle achieves SAE Level 4 autonomy, capable of navigating without human input in specific conditions, by using a sophisticated array of 27 sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar for 360-degree vision. Developed with technology from Mobileye, the van is designed for public transit and corporate mobility services. Pilot programs are planned for Hamburg and Los Angeles, with a broader rollout anticipated for 2026, aiming to address transit challenges like driver shortages.</p>

Despite the difficulties, director Steven Spielberg, then only 27, transformed the troubled shoot into the first-ever summer blockbuster.

          <p>The United States has deported a group of eight men to South Sudan, a nation described by the State Department as dangerously unstable, following a prolonged legal battle. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national; the others are from countries including Myanmar, Cuba, and Mexico, which had reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had blocked the removal. This action is part of the Trump administration's expanding policy of deporting migrants to third countries, a practice that has drawn significant criticism from human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) and DW's Director General have strongly condemned an attack on a DW correspondent and cameraman by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The journalists, who were clearly identified as press, were chased and had stones thrown at them while covering a protest against settler violence in the village of Sinjil. While the DW team escaped without physical injury, their vehicle was badly damaged. The incident, which also forced journalists from other international outlets to flee, has prompted calls for the Israeli government to ensure the safety of all media professionals.</p>

After years of political chaos, Libya's medical infrastructure is broken, with facilities non-functional and essential medicines unavailable.

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have stated that China's military will require structural changes to effectively defend against modern drone threats. They argue it is highly likely the PLA will establish specialized counter-drone combat units designed for rapid response. This analysis comes as drones have played an increasingly decisive role in recent conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and clashes between Israel and Iran. The experts suggest that in the short term, existing units like electronic warfare teams could be upgraded with AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming capabilities.</p>

Chernow's work delves into how Twain's painful early life and fear of poverty shaped his famous sardonic humor and dominated his adult years. The biography traces his journey from a boy on the Mississippi to a world-famous writer and speaker who, despite his fame and wealth, was plagued by ill-fated investments.

His comments come as the White House targets public media entities like PBS and NPR, claiming they spread 'radical, woke propaganda.' Burns, whose documentaries have been a staple of PBS for decades, argued that cutting funds primarily harms rural areas where PBS may be the only available broadcast signal. He emphasized that public broadcasting provides essential services, including children's programming, continuing education, and emergency information, that are vital for all Americans.</p>

          <p>According to former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, deep staffing cuts implemented by the Trump administration have compromised the United States' ability to accurately predict extreme weather. Spinrad noted that many National Weather Service forecast offices are now operating without a full complement of staff, placing an extra burden on the remaining forecasters. While he did not directly link the cuts to the recent Texas flooding disaster, he warned that without adequate research and staffing, the quality of predictions for hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods will inevitably degrade, reducing the public's ability to prepare.</p>
