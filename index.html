While avoiding immediate retaliation, all options remain on the table, including potential counter-tariffs on US goods. Jaguar Land Rover has already paused shipments to the US in response to the tariffs, highlighting the immediate impact on businesses.</p>

          <p>Two Customs and Border Protection officers, Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez, have been charged with accepting bribes to allow undocumented immigrants into the United States through the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The officers allegedly coordinated with human smugglers in Mexico, facilitating the passage of vehicles without proper inspection in exchange for money. Investigators discovered incriminating phone messages and unexplained cash deposits linked to the officers.

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every product entering the US marks a significant shift away from the globalization process. These tariffs, designed to keep work and jobs within the US, take the country back a century in terms of protectionism. This move has sparked concerns about a global trade war and potential damage to the US economy, as it turns its back on the principles of free trade and comparative advantage that have underpinned US economic might for decades.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration argues that a federal judge cannot order the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, urging an appeals court to suspend the ruling. Justice Department lawyers claim that such an order would force the Executive Branch to engage with a foreign power in a way that is constitutionally intolerable. The government insists it has no control over Abrego Garcia and no authority to arrange for his return, likening it to ordering the end of the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>An artist whose official portrait of Donald Trump was publicly criticised by the president said her business is now "in danger of not recovering". The Republican leader made headlines at the end of last month when, in a post on his Truth Social platform, he said the portrait hanging in Colorado's State Capitol had been "purposefully distorted". Following the criticism, officials said the portrait would be taken down and it has since been removed.</p>
