          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 14:50:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering selling his red Tesla Model S following a public falling out with Elon Musk. Trump initially purchased the vehicle to show support for Tesla and Musk, who had faced criticism for his involvement in the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The decision comes after a series of escalating social media exchanges between the two, marking a significant shift from their previous alliance. The feud appears to stem from disagreements over policy and Musk's criticisms of the Republican tax and budget bill.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse is experiencing a rebound in customer traffic as the summer season begins.

          <p>President Trump has called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a strong jobs report.

Markets are not anticipating any rate cuts at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The last time the central bank made a single rate cut of a full percentage point was in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues that the district judge lacked the authority to require the rehiring of the workers. The staff reduction was intended to streamline the department and eliminate discretionary functions, but the judge pointed out that the cuts led to the closure of civil rights enforcement offices.
