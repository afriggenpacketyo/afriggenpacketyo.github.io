          <p>This article reports on a study that suggests high doses of radiotherapy, while effective in targeting localized cancer tumors, may paradoxically promote the growth of existing metastatic tumors. The research, conducted at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre, found that radiation could lead to the growth of tumors even when those tumors had not directly received radiation therapy.

          <p>This article reports that the world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, primarily due to fires. Researchers estimate a loss of 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests, an area nearly the size of the Republic of Ireland. Fires, exacerbated by drought, have overtaken land clearances for agriculture as the main cause. The loss of these forests releases billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases, raising concerns about their resilience and potential tipping points. South East Asia bucked the trend with reduced forest loss due to government policies.</p>
