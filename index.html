          <p>A power outage, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting around 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas. An electricity substation was reportedly set on fire, and a pylon at another location was damaged, leading to the power loss. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply. French authorities are investigating the incident as a potential act of arson, mobilizing resources to identify and apprehend the perpetrators responsible for the damage to electrical infrastructures. Optimism regarding the event's continuation helped mitigate potential panic. </p>

The scammers aim to extract personal and financial information from unsuspecting recipients, prompting intervention from the FBI and FTC due to the rise in such fraudulent activities. Experts advise registering phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, avoiding clicking unrecognized links, and remaining skeptical when personal information is requested to protect against digital theft. </p>

Panahi, who was previously banned from filmmaking and international travel, returned to Cannes in person for the first time in over two decades. He emphasizes that his film is inspired by conversations with prisoners and aims to highlight the brutality of the Iranian government, stating that the regime inadvertently contributed to the film's creation through his imprisonment. </p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached the building on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction, leading the Pentagon tower to delay landing clearance. The Army stated that there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic, attributing the aborted landings to an abundance of caution by air traffic controllers. The FAA declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. </p>

This project, the state's largest effort to address the environmental problems at the shrinking lake, involves flooding an area in Imperial County after an adjacent area received its first water in April. The Species Conservation Habitat Project, initially envisioned to cover 4,100 acres, is now planned to expand to over 9,000 acres with additional federal funding.
