          <p>President Trump, alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, announced a new initiative to arm Ukraine where European allies will pay for U.S.-made weapons to be sent to the front lines. In a significant policy shift, Trump also threatened Russia's trade partners with 100% secondary tariffs if a peace deal to end the war is not reached within 50 days. This dual announcement marks a more aggressive stance, reflecting the administration's growing frustration with the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists in Guam Discover 3,500-Year-Old Rice Remnants</h2>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania at a site in Guam, dating back 3,500 years. The remnants were found in the form of phytoliths, which are microscopic plant fossils, on the surface of ancient earthenware pottery. This finding suggests that the first settlers of the island successfully transported and cultivated rice after a record-setting ocean migration, likely using the grain for specialized ritual purposes rather than as a daily food source.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's launch of an EPA website to debunk the "chemtrails" conspiracy theory has drawn criticism from experts who study misinformation. They point out the irony of the administration tackling one conspiracy theory while actively promoting others and spreading misinformation about the climate crisis. Critics argue the move is a distraction from the administration's anti-environmental policies and that it ultimately undermines trust in institutions.</p>
