          <p>The Co-op has admitted that a recent cyberattack resulted in the compromise of customer and employee data, confirming earlier reports that the breach was more extensive than initially disclosed. Cyber criminals, identifying themselves as DragonForce, contacted the BBC with proof of infiltrating Co-op's IT networks and stealing substantial data, including usernames, passwords, membership card numbers, names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers. The company had previously downplayed the impact of the attack. The Co-op is taking measures to address the breach, which has affected a significant number of current and past members, but has not confirmed the exact number of individuals impacted.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is set to cut 35 daily flights at Newark Liberty International Airport following significant flight disruptions, with CEO Scott Kirby citing air traffic controller staffing shortages and technology problems as the primary causes. The move comes after more than 300 flights were delayed on Friday, adding to over 1,400 delays and cancellations earlier in the week. The airline stated that it was a disappointing but necessary decision to protect customers, given the lack of immediate solutions to the structural issues at the FAA. United had previously cited FAA technology outages, runway construction, and high winds as contributing factors.</p>

The proposed parade would coincide with the Army's 250th-anniversary celebration and President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, sparking speculation that it fulfills Trump's previous desire for a grand military display.

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration intends to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating a conflict with the institution. This action follows previous measures, such as freezing grants and contracts, after Harvard rejected demands related to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Harvard President Alan Garber has questioned the legality of revoking the tax-exempt status, which enables universities to carry out their educational and research missions. Harvard argues that such a move would severely impair its ability to provide financial aid, conduct medical research, and foster innovation.</p>

SpaceX's operations, including frequent rocket launches, have already disrupted daily life, with residents citing shaking homes and illegal dumping of polluted water. If Starbase becomes its own municipality, SpaceX aims to control the nearby beach and road, leading to proposed bills that would allow the closure of beaches and roads on weekdays.

          <p>Recent election results across England reveal significant shifts in the political landscape, indicating challenges for both the Labour and Conservative parties. Labour has experienced a decline in support since their landslide victory, facing criticism over policies like means-testing the winter fuel allowance. The Conservatives are facing even greater difficulties, with Reform UK gaining ground and the Liberal Democrats making inroads in traditional Tory strongholds. These results suggest a fragmentation of the British political landscape, with smaller parties playing an increasingly important role.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has injected himself with snake venom and allowed snakes to bite him over 200 times, has helped scientists identify antibodies that could lead to a universal antivenom. Researchers have isolated broadly acting antibodies from Friede's blood that can neutralize the venom of multiple snake species. This breakthrough could address a global health problem, as snakebites affect millions worldwide, resulting in numerous deaths and disabilities. The researchers plan to test the treatment in dogs bitten by venomous snakes in Australia.</p>

          <p>Block reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations and issued a disappointing outlook, causing the stock to tumble. Revenue decreased by about 3% from the previous year, and gross profit also missed analysts' forecasts. The company provided weaker-than-expected profit guidance for the second quarter and full year, citing challenging economic conditions. Despite these challenges, Block expects a pickup later this year due to the nationwide expansion of the Cash App Borrow program.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in English local elections, establishing itself as a strong challenger to the main parties. The party has won over 660 council seats, seizing control of eight authorities from the Conservatives and winning the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. Reform has also secured its first mayoral contests in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull & East Yorkshire. These results indicate a growing fragmentation of the British political landscape, with the combined projected share of the vote for the Conservatives and Labour falling below 50%.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson warns that foreign investors are becoming increasingly wary of investing in America due to concerns about tariffs and the potential weaponizing of capital markets. She notes that many foreign investors are reducing their exposure to U.S. assets, which could have significant implications for U.S. markets. Patterson suggests that this shift is driven by a loss of faith in the U.S. as a reliable partner, leading investors to seek opportunities in other markets or alternative assets like gold.

He highlights the decline in public confidence in higher education and suggests that blurring the lines between academic and political pursuits has contributed to this erosion. Barak emphasizes the importance of professionalism in the classroom and the value of objective truth, collaboration, and developing critical thinking skills. He argues that when ideology seeps into education, it has the opposite effect and undermines the mission of universities.</p>
