          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed a massive legislative package that extends the 2017 tax cuts, increases spending on border security and defense, and enacts significant policy changes. The bill introduces new work requirements and restrictions for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years and result in millions losing health coverage. The bill passed narrowly along party lines and now heads to the president for his signature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a controversial and sweeping spending bill into law during the White House's Fourth of July celebrations. The president framed the legislation, which includes major tax cuts and benefit reductions, as a historic achievement that cuts waste and fraud. The signing followed a contentious passage through Congress, with Democrats fiercely opposing the bill's cuts to social programs like Medicaid. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a record-breaking eight-hour speech denouncing the legislation as deeply damaging to the American people.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks has outlined five types of 'toxic' foods he avoids giving his own children. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of nitrates and preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor health. The article recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>Two brothers are on trial for allegedly assaulting three police officers at Manchester Airport in a violent confrontation captured on CCTV. The incident reportedly began when one of the brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, confronted and head-butted another man in a Starbucks. When armed police located the brothers at a car park payment machine to make an arrest, they allegedly resisted and assaulted the officers, breaking one officer's nose. The defendants claim they were acting in self-defense during the entire altercation.</p>

          <p>A provision in a newly passed spending bill will create a temporary federal income tax deduction for tipped workers, a move touted by President Trump as fulfilling his 'no tax on tips' promise. The new deduction is limited and set to expire in 2028. Critics argue the measure is a flawed way to help low-wage workers, as over a third of them earn too little to have any federal tax liability to begin with. The benefit will primarily affect middle and some high-earning tipped employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested hosting a UFC fight on the White House grounds as part of the celebrations for America's 250th anniversary in 2026. During a speech in Iowa, Trump floated the idea of building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 people for a championship fight. He mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a supporter of the president, would be involved in organizing the event. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major sporting event of this kind has been hosted at the White House.</p>

The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in under 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the tests.</p>

Polling suggests such a party could capture 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters, potentially altering the UK's political landscape.</p>
