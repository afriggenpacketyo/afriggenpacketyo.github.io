          <p>The Supreme Court has granted a temporary injunction, restoring Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby's right to vote in the state house after she was censured for a controversial social media post about a transgender student athlete. The post included the student's name and photo, leading to concerns about safety and privacy after Libby refused to remove it. The Maine House stripped Libby of her voting rights, prompting a lawsuit arguing that her punishment silenced her constituents. Justice Jackson dissented, criticizing the Court's increasing use of the 'shadow docket' for emergency rulings, but the majority sided with Libby, raising First Amendment concerns over the censure.

          <p>President Trump has unveiled plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, designed to protect the United States from foreign missile threats, drawing inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome. The project is estimated to cost $175 billion, with an initial $25 billion allocated to begin construction, and aims to integrate advanced technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. The system is projected to be fully operational before the end of Trump's term in 2029, with construction planned in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia, and Indiana. The announcement follows a Pentagon intelligence assessment warning of increasing missile threats from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.</p>

          <p>The Qatari Prime Minister announced that recent ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Qatar have stalled due to a fundamental gap in their objectives. While one party seeks a partial agreement that could lead to a comprehensive resolution, the other is focused on a one-off deal to end the war and release all hostages. Hamas accused Israel of not engaging in serious negotiations, while the Israeli Prime Minister's Office claimed Hamas rejected the American proposal for hostage release. Amid these discussions, the IDF initiated a new ground operation in Gaza, drawing condemnation from international leaders who urge a halt to military actions and the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, asserting it as a presidential right to deport individuals without due process. Senator Hassan corrected Noem, emphasizing that habeas corpus is a foundational right distinguishing free societies from police states. Noem's remarks, made amidst an unprecedented campaign of detentions and deportations, have drawn criticism, especially as courts have ruled some actions violate detainees' habeas corpus rights. The White House previously suggested suspending habeas corpus for migrants, claiming an 'invasion' by a Venezuelan gang, further fueling controversy.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy signed an order directing the Department of Transportation to enforce the law, emphasizing that it prioritizes public safety over political correctness. The move follows President Trump's executive order requiring English literacy tests for truckers, addressing communication issues between drivers and officials. Secretary Duffy stated that drivers unable to read stop signs or understand instructions pose a threat to all Americans on the road, leading to immediate removal from service for non-compliant truckers.</p>

          <p>Former President Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis raises questions about screening efficacy, as even diligent testing may miss aggressive forms. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, yet many men continue. Some men experience sudden surges in PSA levels or have advanced cancer despite normal PSA results. Fast-growing cancers can arise between screenings or remain undetectable by PSA tests, which are not perfect diagnostic tools. Experts caution against overestimating the PSA's power and emphasize shared decision-making with doctors, balancing potential benefits with treatment side effects.</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of Walmart for blaming tariffs on impending price increases has sparked debate among economists about corporate responsibility. While mainstream economists argue companies must pass along the cost of tariffs, populist thinkers suggest corporations have more pricing power than acknowledged. The debate centers on whether companies should absorb tariff costs to protect consumers or if raising prices is an inevitable response. Some argue large companies could mitigate price increases by accepting lower margins or shifting supply chains, while others suggest companies exploit inflation concerns to manipulate prices.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company will have robotaxis on the streets of Austin, Texas, by the end of June. Musk said Tesla aims to bring its robotaxis to Los Angeles and San Francisco following the planned Austin debut. Musk said a Tesla robotaxi service will start with about 10 vehicles in Austin, and rapidly expand to thousands of vehicles should the launch go well with no incidents. To start, Tesla has said its robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with a forthcoming version of FSD, or full self-driving, known as FSD Unsupervised.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to develop a missile defense system designed to detect, track and potentially intercept incoming missiles. He says his "Golden Dome" would cost $175 billion (€155 billion) and he wants it "fully operational before the end of my term." Trump has asked for an initial $25 billion for the program in a sweeping tax-cut bill currently being reviewed by Congress. Trump said efforts to build the missile shield system will be under the leadership of US Space Force General Michael Guetlein. He added that Canada has also expressed interest in being covered by the dome.</p>

          <p>Novavax secured FDA approval for its COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but faces restrictions limiting its use to individuals aged 65 and older and those with underlying medical conditions. The decision reflects skepticism from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and leaders appointed across federal health agencies regarding vaccines. The FDA will outline its approach to COVID vaccination at a virtual event, potentially altering regulatory approval requirements for shots. Despite the narrower approval, analysts view it as a win for Novavax, expecting commercial delivery this fall in partnership with Sanofi.</p>

Alaska, Hawaii and parts of the mainland America’s West Coast are at risk if an earthquake erupts along the Cascadia subduction zone, a fault stretching from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino, California. A recent study by Virginia Tech geoscientists published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences estimates that there’s a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years.</p>

          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, stolen from his grave site in Paris in 1988, has been recovered by police after 37 years. The discovery occurred during an unrelated investigation, with authorities providing few details. The bust, sculpted by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was placed on Morrison’s tombstone in 1981 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of his death. A representative from Morrison’s estate expressed happiness at the recovery, noting that it was a piece of history the family wanted at the grave.</p>
