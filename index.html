            <p>The Atlantic explores whether OpenAI's potential foray into social media signals a strategic shift away from its original mission of developing beneficial superintelligence. Critics argue that creating a social network, akin to the current state of established platforms, seems misaligned with OpenAI's ambitious goals and raises concerns about the company prioritizing user engagement over groundbreaking AI research. The discussion delves into whether OpenAI is being distracted by the consumer product success of ChatGPT and whether it is trying to innovate by becoming the browser for the internet.</p>

The White House's discontent with Powell has intensified, with economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggesting that Trump and his team are evaluating options for removing the Fed chair. Trump's remarks follow Powell's warning that Trump's tariff plan could increase inflation and create challenges for the central bank. Some Democrats, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, have defended Powell, warning that firing him would destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that President Trump's actions towards universities like Harvard and Columbia are part of a larger effort to hold higher education accountable for its use of taxpayer funds. The author suggests that universities have long benefited from generous government support, predicated on the understanding that they contribute to the common good. However, the author contends that many institutions have strayed from this mission, promoting ideologies that undermine traditional values. Trump's efforts to condition federal funding on compliance with civil rights laws are seen as a necessary step to restore the original quid pro quo between taxpayers and universities.</p>

            <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responding to concerns about privacy for telehealth therapy sessions with a new memo emphasizing the need for confidential workspaces for mental health clinicians. This follows reports that many therapists fear they will be unable to provide therapy in private spaces after a mandatory return-to-work order. The memo stipulates that telehealth spaces should offer the same level of privacy as in-person visits, though confusion remains about whether therapists can continue working from home if private office space is unavailable. Some clinicians worry that overcrowded facilities will make it difficult to meet privacy requirements.</p>

            <p>The United States is experiencing a significant surge in measles cases, reaching the highest level in a single year since 2019, with a growing number of infections reported across multiple states. A major outbreak in West Texas has contributed to the rising numbers, resulting in the tragic deaths of two children. Health officials emphasize the importance of vaccination as a safe and effective measure to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is tracking confirmed cases nationwide, urging communities to prioritize vaccination efforts to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

            <p>A federal court has temporarily halted the Trump administration's attempt to eliminate staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), raising questions about the legality of the action. The ruling came after the administration announced sweeping layoffs, impacting key divisions within the agency. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the move, arguing it undermines the CFPB's ability to protect consumers from financial scams. The legal battle highlights the ongoing conflict over the future of the CFPB and its role in regulating the financial industry.</p>

            <p>Attorneys for Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas are warning that their clients are at imminent risk of deportation to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order after attorneys submitted declarations stating that ICE officers informed several clients they were being sent to El Salvador. A TikTok video appears to show a detained individual displaying a notice stating they are being removed as "enemies" and members of Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, arguing that Tren de Aragua is a "hybrid criminal state" invading the United States.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who the Justice Department admits was wrongfully deported due to an "administrative error." Van Hollen shared a photo of the meeting, prompting a sharp rebuke from President Trump, who repeated claims that Abrego Garcia is a dangerous criminal. Despite court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, the Trump administration has alleged his involvement with the MS-13 gang, a claim disputed by his family and attorneys. The situation remains unresolved, with Abrego Garcia's fate uncertain.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has declined to take immediate action to enforce his order that the Trump administration stop blocking The Associated Press from presidential events. The AP argues that the administration is violating its free-speech rights by limiting access due to the outlet's refusal to rename the Gulf of Mexico. The White House has implemented a new press policy that occasionally allows the AP into events, but the AP contends this is merely a tactic to diminish its influence. The judge expressed concerns about the government's actions but said he would assume good faith unless proven otherwise.</p>

            <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times reflects on the impending closure of Say Cheese, a beloved cheese shop in Silver Lake, due to a significant rent increase. The author expresses concern about the loss of unique, local businesses that contribute to the neighborhood's character and sense of community. The closure of Say Cheese is seen as part of a larger trend of rising rents forcing out small businesses, potentially transforming the neighborhood into a less distinctive and more generic version of itself.</p>
