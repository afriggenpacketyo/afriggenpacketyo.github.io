          <p>Russian forces launched a significant drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions, resulting in at least three deaths and numerous injuries, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The strikes targeted Kyiv, Lutsk, and the Ternopil region, with Russia claiming the actions were a response to Ukrainian "terrorist acts." Zelensky has called on the international community, particularly the United States and Europe, to increase pressure on Russia to end the war. The aerial raids have disrupted Kyiv's train system and forced civilians into underground shelters. The number of casualties may increase as rescue operations continue.</p>

          <p>A heated legal battle has erupted over Jimmy Buffett's $275 million estate, with his widow, Jane Buffett, filing a petition to remove co-trustee Richard Mozenter, alleging he failed to act in her best interests.

Mozenter has filed a counter-petition in Florida to remove Jane as co-trustee and representative of the estate. The dispute centers on the management of Buffett's assets, including his Margaritaville empire, and the distribution of funds to his widow. </p>

          <p>In this L.A. Affairs column, a woman recounts her experiences with co-parenting, dating, and taking care of a cat she initially didn't want after her divorce. She acquired the cat out of a sense of single-parent shame and a desire for uniformity between her home and her ex-husband's. Over the years, she grappled with the responsibilities of pet ownership, eventually considering giving the cat away, but ultimately honoring her commitment. The essay explores themes of co-parenting challenges, personal growth, and the complexities of relationships after divorce. </p>

          <p>A contributor argues that Donald Trump's cultural critiques often resonate because they address realities that polite society avoids, such as uncontrolled immigration, violent crime, and foreign adversaries. While Trump's solutions may be flawed, his instincts often align with public concerns, leading voters to believe he at least acknowledges the issues. The contributor suggests that Trump's dominance stems from projecting strength, while his opponents appear hesitant. The piece contrasts Trump's destructive approach with a hypothetical scenario where he governs with competence and compassion, addressing problems effectively while respecting the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Archeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped over 300 acres of parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The scale of the agriculture is surprising, given the relatively poor growing conditions and the presence of wild rice nearby. The discovery highlights the extensive and sophisticated farming practices of Native Americans before European colonization, challenging previous assumptions about their agricultural capabilities.</p>
