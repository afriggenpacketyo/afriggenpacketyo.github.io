          <p>Devastating floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 120 fatalities, with Kerr County being the most severely affected area, reporting 96 deaths including 36 children. In response to the tragedy, President Trump has issued a disaster declaration, and FEMA is assisting with ongoing search and rescue operations for the 161 people still missing. The disaster has also raised serious questions about the effectiveness and timing of the local emergency alert system, as officials reportedly delayed sending out warnings after the initial request.</p>

          <p>As the economic landscape shifts with anticipated interest rate cuts, savers should approach Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts with a more nuanced strategy. This article outlines three critical errors to avoid, including mistakenly assuming CD rates only change with Federal Reserve actions, as banks often adjust their rates preemptively. Savers are also advised not to be distracted by higher short-term rates at the expense of long-term growth and to calculate the full interest-earning potential before committing funds to ensure the account aligns with their financial goals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six Secret Service agents have been suspended following significant security failures during an assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a campaign rally. The disciplinary action has drawn criticism from some Republican lawmakers, like Rep. Anna Paulina Luna and Sen. Mike Lee, who argue that suspension is the "absolute bare minimum" and that the agents should have been fired. The incident, which resulted in the death of a rally attendee, has intensified scrutiny on the agency, especially after a second assassination attempt occurred later, leading to the director's resignation.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. goods, directly mirroring a threat from President Donald Trump to levy the same rate on Brazilian exports. The move signals a potential trade war, with Trump accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and conducting a "witch-hunt" against former president Jair Bolsonaro. President Lula stated that Brazil could use its "Reciprocity Law" to defend its economy and would demand explanations for the proposed U.S. duties, which are part of a broader wave of tariffs Trump is levying on multiple countries.</p>

          <p>The White House has intensified its criticism of the Federal Reserve, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. Vought's claims center on a costly and allegedly "ostentatious" renovation of the Fed's headquarters, suggesting Powell may have misled Congress about the project's details and $2.5 billion price tag. This public attack opens a new front in the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and the central bank, raising questions about potential efforts to remove Powell from his position for cause.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will use its upcoming All-Star Game as a high-profile test for the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System. In this next step toward potential regular-season implementation, each team will receive two challenges that can be used by the batter, pitcher, or catcher to review a ball or strike call. The Hawk-Eye tracking system will determine the outcome, with the results displayed on the scoreboard, as MLB continues to refine a technology that could be formally adopted for the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own liquid cooling hardware to manage the intense heat generated by Nvidia's next-generation AI chips, like the Blackwell series. This development, called In-Row Heat Exchangers (IHRX), allows Amazon to upgrade its existing data centers for the powerful new chips without the time and expense of building new facilities. The innovation is a positive for both companies, enabling Amazon to deploy more of Nvidia's high-demand processors and further solidifying its infrastructure for the AI boom.

          <p>A former Justice Department attorney has provided emails to the Senate Judiciary Committee that appear to support his whistleblower complaint against Emil Bove, a top DOJ official. The complaint alleges that Bove instructed lawyers to defy court orders that blocked the deportation of immigrants, with one email showing Bove approved deplaning migrants on foreign soil after a judge had ordered the flight to return. The messages provide a remarkable insight into how department lawyers were aware they were potentially violating judicial orders, escalating scrutiny of Bove during his consideration for a federal judgeship.</p>

This ruling is one of several legal challenges across the country aiming to stop the administration's effort to reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which has long guaranteed citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>This essay delves into the historical and cultural weight of the term "middlebrow," tracing its origins to early 20th-century literary debates, particularly those involving Virginia Woolf. Woolf famously despised the "middlebrow" consumer, whom she saw as a dishonest follower of artistic fashion, lacking the conviction of either the intellectual "highbrow" or the authentic "lowbrow." The article reflects on how the term has evolved from a sharp insult into a descriptor for anything perceived as harmlessly pedestrian, questioning the modern anxieties around taste and cultural consumption.</p>

The SBU, which has been linked to assassinations of Russian figures, has not offered a motive for the killing, which comes amidst intensified Russian aerial attacks and ongoing front-line fighting in the more than three-year-long war.</p>
