          <p>President Trump has selected Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination faced Senate opposition. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and past experience as a district attorney. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter, will step down from Fox News to assume the role. This move places a familiar figure in a key prosecutorial position within the Justice Department, overseeing criminal and civil cases in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, suggesting that the start date should be moved back to 1931, when Japan invaded Manchuria, rather than the traditionally recognized 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's contributions and sacrifices in the war against fascism, arguing that the current Western-centric view diminishes China's role. The academics made these calls at a second world war history seminar in Beijing, emphasizing the need to acknowledge China's early resistance against Japanese aggression.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, focusing on allegations that she misrepresented a Virginia property as her primary residence to secure more favorable loan terms.

          <p>President Trump has proposed including a tax increase on high-income earners in the upcoming fiscal package, suggesting a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million, taxed at 39.6%.
