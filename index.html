The call precedes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Washington, where he will meet with President Trump to discuss a potential peace deal with Russia. This diplomatic effort follows a summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin, after which Trump shifted his stance to favor a direct peace agreement over a preliminary ceasefire. European leaders have emphasized that any path to peace must directly involve President Zelensky and uphold Ukraine's security and territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening to a Category 4 storm. Currently located northeast of Puerto Rico, the storm is bringing heavy rain to the region and is expected to track west-northwest before turning north. While meteorological models predict Erin will remain several hundred miles off the U.S. East Coast, its power is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20 to August 27. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for potential beach erosion and dangerous water conditions.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced preparations to move Palestinians from combat zones to southern Gaza, signaling an impending major military offensive in populated areas. This development occurs as several Western nations, including France and Britain, announced their intention to recognize a Palestinian state, criticizing the planned Israeli operation. In Israel, families of the remaining 50 hostages are calling for a nationwide protest, fearing the offensive will further endanger their loved ones. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen, with the UN reporting rising starvation and malnutrition-related deaths as aid delivery remains severely challenged.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, a local Arizona man known for his 'Zombie Hunter' persona, has been found guilty of the 1990s murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. The cold cases were solved after 21 years when investigators used genetic genealogy to link crime scene DNA to Miller. His defense team admitted he was the killer but argued for insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother created a violent alternate personality. Prosecutors countered this by highlighting Miller's memory of other violent acts and his ex-wife's testimony of his abusive behavior, ultimately securing a guilty verdict and a death sentence.</p>

The tariffs were partly a response to India's purchase of Russian crude oil, a move New Delhi defends as a vital national interest. The U.S. remains India's largest single export partner, making the stalled negotiations a significant concern for Indian manufacturers.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of hundreds of their National Guard troops to Washington D.C. This move supports the Trump administration's federal crackdown on the city, which began with an executive order federalizing local police and activating the D.C. National Guard. The administration cites a need to address crime and homelessness, though local data shows violent crime is at a 30-year low. The deployment has sparked protests from residents and criticism from groups who view it as a political overreach and an improper use of military personnel for domestic policing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have declined to comment on the status of quarterback Matthew Stafford following a scheduled workout to test his injured back. Coach Sean McVay is expected to provide an update on Monday, leaving Stafford's availability for the season opener in question.

In his absence during a preseason game against the Chargers, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett showcased a strong performance, completing 28 of 40 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns, highlighting his increasing importance.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are reportedly developing a hypersonic drone carrier featuring an innovative "scissor wing" design, a concept once explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft uses a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This adaptable design aims to overcome the traditional compromises between low-speed efficiency and high-speed drag, enabling versatile performance from takeoff to hypersonic cruise.</p>

The investigation began after a colleague at Craig's dental practice discovered a package of potassium cyanide addressed to him.

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, risk engaging in extramarital affairs. These triggers include the pressure of always being 'good' and following societal expectations, which can lead to a mid-life void. Other factors are the burnout from perfectionism, having poor boundaries developed from a childhood of caregiving, and seeking reprieve from an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage. Additionally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating life and lowering relationship boundaries.</p>

          <h2>Unseasonal Heat and Drought in UK Cause Signs of an Early Autumn</h2>

          <p>Despite ongoing summer heatwaves, parts of the United Kingdom are exhibiting signs of an early autumn, such as leaves turning yellow and falling from trees. Experts attribute this phenomenon not to a seasonal shift but to the stress placed on nature by a prolonged period of hot and dry weather, with this summer on track to be one of the warmest on record. The drought conditions are causing trees to enter survival mode by shedding leaves and branches, while some fruits like blackberries are ripening unusually early. Conservationists warn this disruption to natural cycles could have negative impacts on wildlife that depend on seasonal food sources.</p>

          <p>A homeless man in Washington D.C., Bill Theodie, was forced to move after his tent encampment was abruptly cleared by city officials with a bulldozer. The removal occurred just four days after President Donald Trump posted a photo of Mr. Theodie sitting by his tent on social media, demanding that homeless individuals be moved out immediately. This action was part of a broader crackdown on homelessness announced by the president. Mr. Theodie, who had been unaware his picture was posted, expressed shock at being used as a political tool and now faces uncertainty after being displaced from a site he had occupied for years.</p>

          <p>An 11-year inquest into the 2013 death of British tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has concluded without determining a cause of death, leaving his body in a Kenyan mortuary. The case has been marked by a bitter feud between Veevers' two sons from his first marriage and his second wife and their two daughters. The sons alleged their father was poisoned to control his multimillion-dollar estate and contested his swift Islamic burial, leading to an exhumation a year later. A magistrate has now ordered the body released for reburial, but with the family deeply divided, the dispute over his final resting place is expected to continue.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK, now preparing to receive their GCSE results, have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021. The letters were written just after returning to school from a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown and reflect their anxieties and hopes from that period. The students' writings captured their fears about the pandemic, their dreams for the future, and personal questions about growing up. The exercise served as a poignant reminder of their journey through a secondary education uniquely disrupted by the global pandemic, highlighting their resilience and personal growth over the past four years.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning children affected by the war in Ukraine. The letter vaguely calls on Putin to "restore their melodic laughter" and states that he is fit to implement this vision "with a stroke of the pen." While administration officials claimed the letter mentioned the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia—a recognized war crime—the publicly released text does not explicitly reference abductions. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the issue of forcibly deported children.</p>

          <p>The Chilean government plans to expropriate a portion of Villa Baviera, formerly known as Colonia Dignidad, to create a memorial for victims of the Pinochet dictatorship. The site was home to a secretive German sect led by Paul Schäfer, who collaborated with the regime to torture and execute political prisoners in the 1970s and 80s. The plan has divided the remaining residents of the community, many of whom were also victims of Schäfer's abuse and forced labor. While victims' families support creating a place of remembrance, some current residents fear the expropriation will displace them and disrupt the lives they have rebuilt.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, offering authentic, regionally diverse cuisine that moves far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition in their home market, brands specializing in fiery Hunanese dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using Singapore as a launchpad for international growth. These establishments aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese food by showcasing its sophistication and diversity through high-quality ingredients and immersive dining experiences. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a potent form of cultural diplomacy, or "ping-pong diplomacy," for modern China.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, a period considered his last major burst of creativity. The collection includes his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads like "Separate Ways," recorded during the collapse of his marriage. This era also saw Presley nearly cast in the remake of "A Star Is Born" opposite Barbra Streisand, a role that friends believe could have altered his career's trajectory before his death in 1977. The recordings showcase a mature artist grappling with personal turmoil, backed by his formidable live TCB Band.</p>
