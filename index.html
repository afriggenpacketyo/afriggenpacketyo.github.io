          <p>Former Ohio State quarterback Will Howard, despite leading the Buckeyes to a national championship, faced criticism for his performance at the NFL Scouting Combine.  He attributes the negative media attention to overreactions from Michigan fans, highlighting a few missed throws while noting others also made mistakes.  Howard's pro day performance showcased his skills, suggesting a possible late-round draft pick. The bias is apparent in the framing of the story, focusing on the Michigan fans' reaction and downplaying the combine performance issues.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles, despite its profitable 1984 Olympics, faces potential budget shortfalls for the 2028 Games due to the city's current financial struggles and the increased scale of the event.
