          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative store of value. The Senate recently advanced crypto legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a previous bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong inflows, and public companies now hold 15% of the total bitcoin supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a ruling concerning President Donald Trump's ability to fire members of other federal agencies' boards, the Supreme Court suggested that Federal Reserve board members would have special protection against being fired by a president. The court distinguished the Federal Reserve as a "uniquely structured, quasi-private entity" following the historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States. While the decision allows Trump to remove two members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, it implies that any attempt to fire a Federal Reserve board member would face strong resistance from the current Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from attempting to dismantle the Department of Education. The order prevents the administration from firing half of the DOE's workforce and transferring management of federal student loans to the Small Business Administration. Judge Myong Joun criticized the administration's claim that the changes were to improve efficiency, stating they would make it "effectively impossible" for the department to carry out its mandated functions. The ruling is a response to a challenge from state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits arguing that the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing the university's failure to adhere to the law. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification was revoked due to non-compliance. The university responded that it is fully committed to maintaining its ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries. The White House has demanded changes to Harvard's hiring, admissions, and teaching practices to combat antisemitism on campus, threatening to revoke the university's tax-exempt status and freeze government grants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to terminate the Flores Agreement, a longstanding court settlement that requires the U.S. government to provide basic rights and services to migrant children in its custody. The Justice Department argues the agreement has incentivized illegal border crossings and hamstrung the executive branch from effectively setting immigration policy. The settlement, in place since 1997, requires federal immigration officials to hold migrant children in safe and sanitary facilities, provide them access to lawyers, and seek their expeditious release from government custody. Attorneys representing migrant children argue that eliminating the agreement's protections would give the government unchecked power to imprison children indefinitely in secret facilities.</p>

This comes after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, and his claims have been met with mixed reactions, particularly from Israel.

The inquiry is based on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prevents discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The school had previously overhauled its admissions process to diversify its student body, leading to a decrease in the percentage of Asian students.

          <p>Gas prices are expected to be at their lowest level since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, with an average of $3.08 per gallon. This is attributed to uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production by OPEC+ countries. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses are up, including entertainment and dining out. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama are expected to have the lowest average gas prices, while California, Hawaii, and Washington will have the highest.</p>

          <p>Democrats are criticizing the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by the House, arguing it benefits the wealthy while harming low-income Americans. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boosts spending for the military and border security but cuts Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt and decrease resources for the lowest-income Americans. Republicans defend the bill as an effort to remove "waste, fraud, and abuse" within assistance programs and provide relief to working-class families through the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime pay.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump will host a gala for top holders of his cryptocurrency token, $Trump, at his private golf club near Washington D.C., despite nearly half of the gala's guests suffering losses from purchasing it. The attendees are winners of Trump's meme coin competition, but a Guardian analysis suggests that many have lost money on the coin. While the Trump administration is not directly involved in administering $Trump, Trump-affiliated entities own 80% of its supply and made $320 million in trading fees as of May 6.

Trump responded insouciantly, stating he would take it if offered. Ramaphosa brought a 30-pound book of South African golf courses and a billionaire South African businessman as guests, appealing to Trump's interests. The incident highlights the perception of Trump's affinity for gifts and the various ways individuals and nations seek to cultivate favor with him.</p>

          <p>David Brooks argues that the populist narrative of America's economic decline due to globalization and neoliberalism is historically inaccurate. He contends that there never was a market-worshiping era of pure globalization and that wages stagnated mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, not during the 1990s and early 2000s. He also argues that American manufacturing jobs have declined mostly due to increased productivity, not foreign competition. Brooks suggests that the forces driving global populism are primarily about immigration, cultural values, and social distrust, not economic decline.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, compared to DDP-4 inhibitors. The study found a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause in patients taking GLP-1s. While the difference was not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all causes of death. Researchers hope to continue the study for a longer duration and with participants who do not have diabetes.</p>

Brent crude futures slumped last month on fears the supply surge could coincide with a global economic slowdown.

          <p>The UK government's decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has sparked debate over whether it's a strategic necessity or a weakening of UK security. The government argues that without ceding sovereignty, the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia would become unworkable due to international legal challenges. Critics argue that the legal threat is exaggerated and accuse ministers of being overly submissive to the UN. The government also claims the deal prevents China from establishing a military presence in the islands, while critics suggest Mauritius may still develop closer ties with China.</p>

          <p>The Ezra Klein Show features an interview with Jake Tapper, co-author of "Original Sin," discussing the alleged cover-up of Joe Biden's decline leading up to the 2024 election. Tapper recounts how the White House pushed back against concerns about Biden's age and memory, even attacking Attorney General Merrick Garland. They discuss how Biden's staff accommodated his limitations, the decision to proceed with a June debate, and the events that led to Biden's eventual decision to withdraw from the race. Tapper and Klein also examine the broader lessons about the power of personality-driven parties and the importance of truth-telling in politics.</p>
