          <p>Luxury parka maker Canada Goose is reportedly receiving take-private bids valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion, as its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, explores offloading its stake. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, with other interested buyers including Bosideng International and a consortium led by FountainVest Capital and Anta Sports Product. This move comes as Canada Goose struggles with growth momentum in key markets and faces questions about its brand positioning and marketing strategy. The potential privatization offers greater autonomy to address these challenges and revitalize the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, a move Cook and her attorney assert is illegal and without legal basis. Cook, appointed in 2022 for a term until 2038, maintains she will continue her duties and plans to file a lawsuit challenging the action. The Federal Reserve Act stipulates governors can only be removed "for cause," a legal standard that will be tested. This dramatic action follows months of Trump's public criticism against the central bank and its interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>Civil rights organizations, including the NAACP and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, have filed a lawsuit against Texas, aiming to overturn new redistricting maps. They argue the maps, which are expected to favor Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections, unconstitutionally dilute the electoral influence of Black voters. Texas Republicans contend the maps are legally drawn based on political performance, while Democrats accuse them of racial gerrymandering. This legal challenge highlights ongoing tensions over voting rights and political representation in the state.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading results as investors evaluated new industrial profits data from China. China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, slipping only 1.5% year-on-year after months of steeper declines, attributed to Beijing's efforts against price wars. Meanwhile, new U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian exports, pushing total duties to 50%, are set to take effect.

These troops are part of a White House-directed "Safe and Beautiful Task Force" under President Trump's crime emergency plan, with others patrolling with police. The unusual optics of Guard members collecting litter underscore a broader political debate about the capital's image and recovery efforts. City officials aim to capitalize on America's 250th anniversary in 2026 to attract more visitors.</p>

          <p>India's substantial merchandise exports to the U.S., totaling $86.51 billion annually, are now subject to a steep 50% tariff following President Trump's additional 25% levies over India's Russian oil purchases. Analysts warn these higher tariffs could severely diminish India's attractiveness as a manufacturing hub and impact its economic growth, potentially reducing GDP by 0.6 percentage points. Key export sectors like engineering goods, gems, jewelry, textiles, and pharmaceuticals are highly exposed to these duties.

          <p>China's industrial profits decreased by 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is largely attributed to Beijing's policy interventions aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and enhancing corporate margins. While state-backed firms saw a 7.5% profit drop in the first seven months, businesses with foreign investments experienced a 1.8% increase. The mining industry faced a significant 31.6% plunge, contrasting with profit improvements in manufacturing and utilities sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have announced their initial 53-man roster for the upcoming season, with Trey Lance winning the backup quarterback position behind Justin Herbert. This decision highlights Lance's potential after beating out veteran Taylor Heinicke, instilling confidence from Coach Jim Harbaugh. The roster features a new running back duo in Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris, and a bolstered defensive line. While the offensive line faces injury concerns, the team aims to build on a more settled foundation than last year. Harbaugh anticipates further roster adjustments in the coming days.</p>

          <p>Microsoft requested police intervention to remove protesters who improperly entered its Redmond headquarters, demonstrating against the company's alleged software use by the Israeli military in Gaza. Activists from "No Azure for Apartheid," including current and former employees, stormed President Brad Smith's office, delivering a court summons. Smith stated that while Microsoft respects employee views, trespassing and planting listening devices are unacceptable, leading to the removal of seven individuals, two of whom were employees facing potential disciplinary action. Microsoft asserts most work with the Israeli Defense Force involves cybersecurity and is investigating the alleged surveillance use.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel, the U.S. restaurant chain, has abandoned its modernized logo and will reinstate its traditional "Old Timer" design after facing fierce public and financial backlash. The company's interim CEO confirmed they listened to customer feedback, including calls from President Donald Trump, who criticized the rebrand. The new logo, which removed the iconic man leaning against a barrel, was part of an effort to update the brand's image but led to accusations of abandoning its Southern roots and a 7% nosedive in stock value. This reversal aims to restore customer loyalty and brand identity.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is investigating whether former senior FBI officials mishandled classified documents related to the 2016 Russia election interference probe. These documents were reportedly found in "burn bags" at FBI headquarters, raising concerns about their proper destruction. The "Crossfire Hurricane" investigation, which concluded Russia interfered to benefit Trump's campaign, has been a long-standing target of the President's criticism, who labeled it a "hoax." This new probe follows claims by top administration officials that Obama-era intelligence leaders may have broken the law, intensifying the political scrutiny of the FBI's past actions.</p>

          <p>The small Tennessee town of Mason is deeply divided over the potential reopening of a shuttered private prison as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center. Town leaders, including Mayor Eddie Noeman, support the CoreCivic-owned facility, citing its promise of over 200 new jobs and significant tax revenue for the financially troubled town. However, Alderwoman Virginia Rivers and other residents oppose it, raising concerns about human rights and the nature of for-profit prisons. This proposal follows President Trump's reversal of a policy that had previously forced the facility's closure, reigniting local debate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn another $175 million in funding for California's beleaguered high-speed rail project, marking a further setback for the state's ambitious infrastructure plans. This follows a previous cancellation of $4 billion in federal grants earlier this summer, prompting California to sue the administration. The funds were intended for grade separation, design work, and a station in Madera. The 16-year project, aiming to link Los Angeles and San Francisco, has faced numerous delays and spiraling costs, with projected expenses now reaching $89 billion to $128 billion and no operational sections yet.</p>

          <p>Grocery giant Kroger is laying off nearly 1,000 corporate employees as part of a business restructuring effort aimed at trimming costs and simplifying its operations. These layoffs affect corporate staff, not store, manufacturing, or distribution center employees. This move follows a challenging period for Kroger, including a failed $24.6 billion merger with Albertsons, which was blocked by a federal judge over antitrust concerns. The company has also faced leadership changes and labor disputes, but its shares have risen over 30% in the past year, indicating investor confidence in its strategic adjustments.

          <p>Parts of central Arizona were enveloped by a towering haboob, a powerful dust storm, on Monday evening, creating dramatic scenes across the region. Originating in southern Arizona, the storm reached Phoenix within two hours, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile and causing over 39,000 power outages in Maricopa County. Meteorologists explain that haboobs form from strong thunderstorm winds pushing air down and forward, picking up vast amounts of dust. While common in dry regions, this particular event gained significant attention due to its size and impact on a metropolitan area, highlighting the dangers of reduced visibility for drivers.</p>

          <p>Kapalua Resort in Maui, Hawaii, home to the PGA Tour's annual Sentry tournament, will close its Plantation and Bay golf courses for two months starting September 2 due to a severe water dispute.

The resort owner and homeowners have sued Maui Land & Pineapple, alleging failure to maintain a century-old water delivery system. Maui Land & Pineapple counters that the problem stems from record low stream levels, not system disrepair, advocating for collaboration over litigation.</p>
