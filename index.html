          <p>At a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, former President Trump announced over $90 billion in new investments for Pennsylvania from leading technology and energy companies. The initiative aims to establish a new artificial intelligence economy by building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub for worker training. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event highlighted plans for significant job creation, including Westinghouse's commitment to build ten new nuclear reactors. While the summit drew major industry and political leaders, it also faced protests from activists concerned about its focus on fossil fuels and corporate interests.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo was compromised, leading to the posting of abhorrent racist and antisemitic messages. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the show, condemned the content and confirmed the account was briefly hacked despite security measures. The posts, which included slurs and references to political figures, were quickly removed, and the account has since been secured. The incident occurs amid a documented rise in antisemitic content and hate speech on the platform since its acquisition by Elon Musk, as tracked by organizations like the Anti-Defamation League.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six counts, including capital murder, for the killing of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the attempted murder of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. The indictment includes a "notice of special findings," the first step toward seeking the death penalty, a decision to be made by the Attorney General. Authorities also revealed a letter from Boelter to the FBI director containing bizarre claims, including that he was trained by the military and that Governor Tim Walz had asked him to assassinate other politicians.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to explain her previous comments regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files, particularly her statement about reviewing an alleged "client list." This comes after the Justice Department announced it found no evidence of such a list, fueling frustration among some administration supporters. Johnson stated his support for transparency and the release of all documents, while other Republicans are pushing for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress. The pressure highlights a growing intra-party divide over the handling of the politically sensitive investigation.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills, supported by President Trump, failed to pass a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives, stalling their progress. The vote, which saw thirteen Republicans join Democrats in opposition, was a setback for the crypto industry during a "Crypto Week" initiative. The proposed legislation included measures to regulate stablecoins, clarify agency oversight between the SEC and CFTC, and prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency. The failure led to a drop in the stock prices of several crypto-related companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge sided with credit unions who argued the CFPB had overstepped its authority. Consumer advocacy groups criticized the decision as a win for corporate interests, while credit industry associations argued it protects lenders by providing a more complete financial picture of borrowers.</p>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's statements about redeploying the agency, coupled with slow responses to recent floods in Texas and wildfires in California, suggest a dismantling of federal capabilities. Critics argue that shifting responsibility to states requires robust federal support, yet the administration is simultaneously cutting climate research, infrastructure grants, and forecasting services.

          <p>British counter-terrorism police have issued a warning that hostile states like Russia, Iran, and China are increasingly attempting to recruit vulnerable individuals, including teenagers and petty criminals, for espionage and sabotage. This activity now constitutes about 20% of their workload, a five-fold increase since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings. Officials are urging parents and teachers to be vigilant for signs of manipulation, as young people may be drawn in online with offers of money without understanding the severe implications. The warning highlights a growing and complex threat of foreign interference on UK soil.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily stopped the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to terminate the program, which grants deportation relief and work permits, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved. However, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-week administrative stay to allow for legal briefs to be filed by both the government and advocacy groups. The ruling provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans currently enrolled in the program, whose futures in the U.S. remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of hiring experienced foreign nationals as air traffic controllers to address a critical staffing shortage in the U.S. According to internal documents, the initiative aims to alleviate strain that has led to flight delays and raised safety concerns. However, the plan faces significant hurdles, including legal restrictions on federal employment for non-citizens and major national security concerns from officials worried about granting foreigners access to sensitive aerospace systems. The proposal highlights the severity of the staffing crisis while creating a potential political conflict with the administration's broader anti-migrant labor stance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to Whoop, the maker of fitness wearables, stating that its new Blood Pressure Insights feature is being marketed without proper regulatory approval. The FDA contends that the feature, which provides blood pressure estimations, functions as a medical device intended to diagnose or treat a condition and therefore requires rigorous review. Whoop responded by stating the FDA is overstepping its authority, arguing the feature is a non-medical wellness tool. The agency has given the company 15 days to address the alleged violations.</p>

After Syrian government forces entered the city of Sweida to restore order, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes, stating it was acting to protect the Druze community. The new Syrian government, which has tried to reassure minority groups, now faces escalating conflict and accusations of its own forces committing atrocities, including field executions.

In a major speech, she argued that the focus has been too much on risk rather than the potential benefits for savers. The government is now working with the Financial Conduct Authority to develop new types of targeted support to help consumers make informed investment decisions. This policy push is part of a broader strategy to encourage shifting capital from cash savings into UK companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of catastrophic flash flooding in Texas, authorities in Kerr County are now focusing recovery efforts on draining at least one of the flood-swollen lakes along the Guadalupe River. The search continues for approximately 100 people who remain missing, and officials believe some victims may be trapped in debris that collected in the reservoirs. Dive teams and sonar have already found large objects, including entire trailers, buried under deep water. The complex and potentially expensive operation to drain the lakes is seen as a necessary step to locate the missing and recover hazardous debris.</p>

          <p>The Senate is preparing to vote on a White House request to rescind $9.4 billion in previously approved funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and federal funding for NPR and PBS. The move, known as a rescissions package, requires congressional approval within a 45-day window to prevent the funds from being spent. While the House has already approved the cuts, some Senate Republicans have expressed opposition to certain components, such as defunding the PEPFAR global AIDS program. The Trump administration has since agreed to amend the package to preserve that funding, but the tight deadline leaves little time for negotiation.</p>

          <p>The poor box-office performance of Pixar's latest film, "Elio," is raising questions about the studio's reliable hit-making power. This article argues that the film's failure, which marks a record low opening for the company, suggests the Pixar brand alone may no longer guarantee a theatrical event. The film's tumultuous production, which saw its director replaced and script reworked, may have contributed to a final product that lacked a strong creative vision. With several major sequels in the pipeline, the studio's strategy may be shifting away from the novel, personal stories that once defined its success.</p>
