          <p>The United States and Iran are scheduled to resume high-level talks in Oman on Sunday regarding Tehran's nuclear program, marking the sixth round of discussions since April. These talks aim to establish a new agreement to replace the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the U.S. withdrew during Trump's first term. Despite heightened regional tensions, the U.S. delegation is planning to attend, with Iran expressing optimism about reaching a deal that ensures the peaceful nature of its nuclear program under IAEA supervision. Iran seeks a mutually beneficial outcome where it can continue its enrichment program under international oversight, while the U.S. aims to prevent any uranium enrichment.</p>

          <p>The struggling budget retail chain Poundland has been sold for a nominal Â£1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers by its owner, Polish firm Pepco. Poundland, which operates 825 UK stores and employs around 16,000 staff, has faced increasing competition from other discount retailers, leading to a decline in sales. The sale will be followed by a proposed restructure, subject to High Court approval, which could result in store closures. Pepco decided to sell Poundland after its sales slumped, deeming it an unprofitable part of the business despite its continued popularity with millions of customers.</p>

          <p>Federal officials are reportedly reversing the layoffs of over 400 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees who were abruptly dismissed in April. The reinstatement could restore the entire staff of a viral hepatitis laboratory and most employees in one of the CDC's environmental health divisions. The initial layoffs had disrupted critical disease surveillance and environmental health efforts, prompting concerns from public health experts. The reason for the reversal remains unclear, but it follows earlier acknowledgments that some layoffs were unintentional.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is employing a novel strategy of arresting migrants at immigration courts after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dismisses their cases. This tactic is part of ICE's effort to meet a new daily arrest quota, catching judges and lawyers off guard. The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has detailed this approach for judges, encouraging immediate decisions on case dismissals. This strategy streamlines deportations and bypasses the legal system, raising concerns about due process and the rights of immigrants following legal procedures.</p>

          <p>A provision in a bill passed by the House could significantly reduce the retirement income of federal employees, impacting those who have dedicated decades to public service. The bill proposes eliminating a special retirement supplement for federal employees who retire before they are eligible for Social Security. This change would affect employees younger than 57 on January 1, 2028, potentially costing them tens of thousands of dollars in retirement income. Critics argue that this cut undermines the government's ability to retain experienced civil servants, while proponents claim that federal retirement benefits are overly generous.</p>

          <p>The global nuclear watchdog has found Iran has failed to meet its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years, potentially complicating talks between Iran and the US over a new nuclear agreement. The IAEA report cited a general lack of "co-operation" from Iran and raised concerns over secret activities and undeclared nuclear material. A resolution passed by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) carries the threat of an eventual referral to the UN Security Council. Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it would never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.</p>
