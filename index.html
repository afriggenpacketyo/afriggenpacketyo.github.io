          <p>Three alleged Iranian spies, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged in the UK with targeting journalists working for Iran International, a London-based media organization critical of the Iranian regime. The men are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service and carrying out surveillance with the intention of inflicting serious violence against these journalists. The investigation is being led by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, and the defendants have been remanded in custody until their appearance at the Old Bailey on June 6. Iran International has been proscribed in Iran as a terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, are strategizing to offset the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars. With projected profit declines due to the tariffs, the companies are considering strategies such as focusing on sales of popular fuel-efficient models and potential price increases, though they are wary of alienating customers. While increasing local production is an option, it would require significant reorganization of supply chains and may take years. The automakers aim to maintain competitiveness in the U.S. market despite the financial challenges posed by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned that cancelling a series of music festivals at Brockwell Park in south London would be a "devastating blow," impacting thousands of people and local businesses. This follows a High Court challenge won by a resident, Rebekah Shaman, who argued that Lambeth Council lacked the necessary planning permission for the events. The judge found that the council had granted use of the park for nine days more than allowed without additional consent, leading to calls for the events to be cancelled. The council is currently assessing the impact of the judgment and determining next steps.</p>

          <p>Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party in Hungary has proposed a "transparency law" that could be used to suppress dissent and ban political parties and media outlets. The law would allow the government to monitor, restrict, and penalize organizations deemed a threat to national sovereignty, potentially leading to blacklisting and financial penalties. Critics fear this law will create conditions similar to those in Russia, severely restricting freedom of expression and targeting independent media and opposition parties. The law has been widely condemned as an attempt to consolidate power and silence any opposition to Orban's regime.</p>

          <p>Many Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine express skepticism towards diplomatic efforts for a cease-fire, viewing it as a failure if Russia does not conquer all four contested regions. These soldiers voice bitterness about their country's officials and civilians, whom they accuse of benefiting from the war while ignoring frontline hardships. The interviews highlight the challenges President Putin would face in ending the war on terms short of his maximalist goals, given the strong nationalist sentiment among Russian servicemen.
