          <p>A federal jury has acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, each carrying a potential 10-year prison sentence. The verdict followed a seven-week trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a pattern of abuse and coercion. The prosecution alleged Combs used his business empire as a criminal enterprise, while the defense argued the encounters were consensual.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. While Israel has not officially confirmed this agreement, a Hamas official indicated readiness for a deal that ends the war. The proposal, facilitated by Qatar and Egypt, hinges on the release of hostages held in Gaza, a key demand for Israel amid ongoing domestic pressure. The international community is also pushing for renewed aid deliveries and a partial Israeli military withdrawal during the truce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. auto insurance costs rising by over 50% in the last three years, drivers are seeking ways to lower their premiums without compromising on security. Experts suggest several strategies, including maximizing all available discounts for things like anti-theft devices or paperless billing. Bundling auto insurance with other policies, such as home or renters insurance, can also lead to significant savings. Additionally, drivers can review their coverage needs, potentially dropping collision and comprehensive options for older, less valuable cars, and consider raising their deductible for lower monthly payments.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States has reached a new trade agreement with Vietnam, though specific details of the deal were not immediately released. The announcement came shortly before the expiration of a 90-day pause on many of the administration's "reciprocal tariffs." Previously, Vietnamese imports were subject to a broad 46% tariff under the administration's protectionist trade policies. It remains unclear how this new agreement will alter the tariff structure for goods imported from Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Del Monte Foods, a nearly 140-year-old staple of canned goods, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it seeks a buyer for the company. The food producer secured $912.5 million in financing from lenders to maintain operations during the restructuring and sale process. The company cited declining consumer demand and shifting preferences towards healthier, less preservative-laden alternatives as key factors in its financial struggles. This move reflects broader challenges within the processed food industry as consumer habits evolve.</p>

This ruling provides legal certainty for abortion providers and patients in the state, confirming that consensual abortions are not criminalized under the archaic statute.

A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, driven by concerns over cybersecurity and China's geopolitical ties. While a complete decoupling from China is considered unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying its supply of critical components like software and sensors. Taiwan is actively developing a "non-red" supply chain independent of Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>Amid a surge in job cuts across the U.S., a significant number of American workers are experiencing heightened layoff anxiety, which experts say is leading to a vicious cycle of overwork and faster burnout. Many employees, fearing for their jobs, are working longer hours in an attempt to prove their value, negatively impacting their focus and well-being. Career coaches advise that feeling a lack of control is a major stressor and recommend creating a proactive plan, such as updating a resume and networking, to regain a sense of agency and prepare for potential job loss.</p>

          <p>According to a report from payroll firm ADP, private sector employment in the U.S. unexpectedly contracted by 33,000 jobs in June, significantly missing economists' forecasts of a 100,000-job gain. This marks the first monthly decrease since March 2023, signaling potential weakness in the labor market. The decline was driven by job losses in the professional, business, and health services sectors, while goods-producing roles saw a modest increase.
