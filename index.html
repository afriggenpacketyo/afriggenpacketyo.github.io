        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan, the government could be forced to issue refunds totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion. The administration has requested an expedited ruling from the court to overturn an appeals court decision that found the tariffs illegal. While Bessent expressed confidence in winning the case, the administration is also developing backup plans using other legal authorities, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, to implement sector-specific levies if the current tariffs are struck down.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a prolonged slump, forcing many sellers to lower their asking prices due to a shortage of affordable homebuyers and economic uncertainty. In some regions, particularly the South and West, increased housing inventory from new construction is giving buyers more negotiating power for concessions like price reductions and closing cost assistance. Despite this shift, high home prices and mortgage rates continue to sideline a majority of potential buyers, with sales of previously owned homes remaining well below last year's levels.

          <p>The House Freedom Caucus, once a small group of secretive conservative dissenters labeled "legislative terrorists" by former Speaker John Boehner, recently celebrated its tenth anniversary with a policy summit attended by top Republican leaders. The caucus has evolved from a fringe group to a central force in GOP policy debates, working closely with the Trump administration to advance conservative agendas on issues like border security and government spending. Despite ongoing criticism from some fellow Republicans for their disruptive tactics, members assert they are successfully shaping the party's direction and maintaining significant influence within Washington.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the blurring lines between China's civilian technology firms and its defense industry, particularly in artificial intelligence, will present significant challenges to the United States. The analysis points to examples like a commercial drone maker supplying combat systems to the military and a university improving drone targeting for defense applications. This trend of civil-military fusion could create a more agile Chinese defense industrial base, forcing U.S. policymakers to navigate complex trade-offs between maintaining economic openness and protecting national security interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural shift is underway as more Americans, particularly college students from the North, move to the South, drawn by factors like different campus experiences and lower tuition costs. This migration is part of a broader embrace of Southern culture, which began transforming in the 1960s with the civil rights movement and the advent of air conditioning, making the region more accessible and livable. This trend has influenced mainstream American music and business, leading to a complex cultural dynamic where Southern aesthetics are adopted nationally, often without a deep understanding of the region's history.</p>

          <p>A New Zealand man, Tom Phillips, who had been evading authorities with his three children for nearly four years, was shot and killed by police during a confrontation. The incident occurred after Phillips allegedly robbed a store, leading to a shootout that also left an officer critically injured. His children, who had been living in remote, dense forests without formal education or healthcare, were found safe hours later at a campsite, bringing an end to a case that had captivated the nation and involved extensive search efforts.</p>

          <p>Rick Davies, the co-founder and lead singer of the iconic British rock band Supertramp, has passed away at the age of 81 after a long battle with multiple myeloma. Davies was the distinctive voice and pianist behind many of the band's greatest hits, including "Goodbye Stranger" and "The Logical Song." Along with Roger Hodgson, he formed Supertramp in 1969, and their 1979 album "Breakfast in America" achieved massive international success. His soulful vocals and signature touch on the Wurlitzer piano were central to the band's sound.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs are testing his promise of a manufacturing revival, with many businesses reporting negative impacts. In former industrial hubs like Fall River, Massachusetts, manufacturers describe how tariffs on imported supplies have increased costs, hurt profits, and forced them to cut investments in equipment and marketing. While some Trump supporters remain hopeful that the strategy will eventually yield benefits, business surveys and employment data show a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, challenging the administration's claims of a new golden age for American industry.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old boy is recovering after being bitten by a venomous copperhead snake at a day care center in North Carolina, which failed to call 911. Staff at the New Beginnings Child Enrichment Center initially thought the child's swollen hand was due to a splinter before realizing it was a snakebite. The boy's family had to rush him to the hospital themselves, prompting questions about the facility's emergency procedures. The center's director stated the situation was handled "quickly and responsibly," but emergency services confirmed they never received a call.</p>

          <p>Amid a decline in US favorability in Germany, some major American companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald's are rebranding their products to emphasize their local German production and sourcing. Coca-Cola has launched a "Made in Germany" campaign featuring local employees, while McDonald's highlights that 65% of its raw materials are sourced from within the country. This marketing shift reflects a broader trend of American brands tailoring their image to international audiences to navigate a challenging political climate and distance themselves from polarizing US policies, a strategy also seen in other countries like Canada and Denmark.</p>

          <p>The French government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, is facing a critical no-confidence vote that it is widely expected to lose, threatening to deepen the country's political instability. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's deeply unpopular proposal for €44 billion in public spending cuts to address France's soaring debt and budget deficit. A coalition of far-right and far-left parties appears to have enough votes to topple the fragile centrist government, which would leave President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a sixth prime minister and further weaken his domestic authority.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old surfer, identified as Mercury Psillakis, was killed by what biologists believe was a great white shark measuring up to 12 feet off a popular Sydney beach. According to friends, Psillakis spotted the shark first and warned other surfers to get to safety, but was attacked as he tried to return to shore himself, suffering severe leg injuries. This was the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 2022, prompting the closure of nearby beaches and the deployment of additional baited drumlines and surveillance drones to monitor for shark activity.</p>

          <p>President Trump's controversial trade tariffs are facing their most significant legal challenge as the Supreme Court considers whether to hear the case. After an appeals court ruled that the tariffs exceeded presidential authority, the administration has pushed for an expedited review, claiming a ruling against them would devastate the U.S. economy. Legal experts are divided, with some believing the court's conservative majority may side with the president's broad interpretation of emergency powers, while others suggest that some conservative justices might vote against the tariffs to assert judicial independence and counter claims of political bias.</p>
