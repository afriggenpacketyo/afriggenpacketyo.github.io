        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ordered significant reductions to the White House National Security Council, dismissing numerous policy experts, aiming to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication by shifting operations back to their original departments. The NSC will be reduced to approximately the same size as at the end of Trump's first term, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio running the NSC in an unusual double role after the previous advisor was nominated as ambassador to the United Nations. The overhaul is intended to streamline the NSC, which Trump has viewed with distrust since his first term, believing it undermined his policy views. The cuts were catalyzed by an op-ed arguing for consolidation, aligning with Trump's preference for top-down foreign policy decision-making.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, are leaving the firm to start their own legal practice. Their departure follows widespread criticism of Paul Weiss's chairman, Brad Karp, for making a deal with President Trump to avoid restrictions on the firm's business, after Trump signed an executive order that limited Paul Weiss lawyers’ ability to enter courthouses and represent their clients. The deal, which involved other firms as well, was controversial because Karp had previously opposed Trump and fundraised for Democrats. Dunn was supportive of the decision to strike a deal with Mr. Trump and was part of the firm's leadership team that worked with Mr. Karp in getting other partners’ support.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for 10 escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited controversy, with authorities stating that cameras operated by Project N.O.L.A. aided in the recapture of one fugitive. Despite a recent pause in automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. by the New Orleans Police Department due to legal and policy concerns, the technology was utilized during the manhunt. Critics, including the ACLU and some Republicans in Congress, raise constitutional and privacy concerns about the use of live facial recognition, calling it a radical escalation of surveillance power. Project N.O.L.A. operates 200 facial recognition cameras in New Orleans, scanning faces, clothing, vehicles, and license plates, and collaborates with law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>Investors in President Trump's cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, were invited to the White House for a VIP tour, despite claims that Trump's gala for coin holders was separate from his official duties. The event, attended by around 200 crypto traders, including some from overseas, sparked criticism as a "pay for play" scheme where investors gained special access to the president. One top investor, Justin Sun, who has also invested heavily in another Trump-backed crypto venture, posted a video of his White House tour, while the White House maintained the president attended the crypto gala in a personal capacity. The meme coin's website at one point advertised a "Special VIP White House tour" for the top 25 meme coin holders as part of the contest.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States are evolving due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders. The birds' beaks have grown longer and more slender to better access nectar, and males' beaks have become pointier for fighting off competition at feeders. This has also led to the expansion of the hummingbird's range northward, chasing the growing popularity of bird feeders. Researchers analyzed newspaper archives, census data, bird counts, and museum specimens to demonstrate the physical changes in the birds over approximately 10 generations.</p>

Asrarguis emphasizes that Milgrim’s legacy should not be co-opted by those seeking to weaponize her death for political gain. Milgrim was committed to the “third narrative,” focusing on shared humanity and the mutual right to dignity, safety, and peace for Jews and Muslims, and her life should be remembered as hopeful and unbroken by the violence and tragedies of the region.</p>
