          <p>Nancy Urizar is searching for answers after her father, Francisco Urizar, was detained by ICE during a delivery in Pico Rivera, California. Videos of the incident show agents surrounding his truck and taking him into custody, leaving Nancy with unanswered questions about the reason for his detention. She is seeking information about whether her father was targeted due to his appearance or if the arrest was random, especially given increased immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. Francisco Urizar fled Guatemala 35 years ago due to forced conscription, and his daughter is now struggling to locate him in the ICE detainee system, feeling guilty and worried about his well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) currently possesses nearly five times more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee (DNC), marking the widest disparity between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported $72 million on hand at the end of May, while the DNC had only $15 million, raising concerns among some Democrats about the party's direction and fundraising capabilities. Despite the fundraising gap, the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, claiming to have raised roughly $40 million in individual donations since February, a record for that period. This financial disparity comes after Elon Musk's significant contributions to Republican campaigns in the 2024 election cycle, although he plans to reduce his political spending in the future.

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested that Trump's stance might be politically motivated, especially as the president contemplates potential military action against Iran. He emphasized that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard had testified that the intelligence community believes Iran has not authorized a nuclear weapons program since 2003. Reed noted that if Gabbard's testimony were false, it should be corrected immediately, rather than being dismissed in the wake of Israeli actions, underscoring the importance of accurate intelligence in shaping foreign policy decisions.</p>

This military activity occurs amid heightened tensions and speculation about the U.S.'s involvement in the conflict, with the movement of the bombers suggesting a potential readiness for further action.

The incident, described as "terrifying" by players and managers, occurred in the top of the seventh inning when a ball off the bat of Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman hit Bigge in the dugout. Despite the severity of the injury, Bigge remained conscious and gave a thumbs-up to fans before being taken to the hospital.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from immigration detention and stated that the Trump administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Khalil, who was facing deportation, vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, asserting that his release indicates the Trump administration is losing its legal battle to deport pro-Palestinian advocates. The Trump administration is appealing the judge's decision to release Khalil.</p>

          <p>As tensions rise between Israel and Iran, the United States is reportedly moving stealth bombers to the Pacific Ocean. Demonstrations in London and Berlin saw tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors calling for an end to Israel's actions in Gaza, and expressing concern about the potential for a wider regional conflict. Protesters in Germany took issue with comments from Chancellor Friedrich Merz that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran, saying it supported a prolonged war. The overall death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached at least 55,637 people, according to the Hamas-led Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian advised that a Republican proposal to shift some food stamp costs from the federal government to states would violate Senate rules, dealing a blow to Trump's tax and spending cut bill. This loss is expected to impact Republican savings efforts, as they were counting on potential savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to offset tax breaks. The parliamentarian did allow a provision imposing new work requirements for older Americans to receive food stamp aid to stand for now. Senator Amy Klobuchar stated that the ruling prevents Senate Republicans from shifting nutrition assistance costs to states, which would have led to major cuts.</p>
