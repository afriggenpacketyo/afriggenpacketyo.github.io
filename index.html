          <h2>FDA Considers Banning Fluoride Supplements for Children Amidst Health Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 13:45:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering banning fluoride supplements for children due to potential health risks, including concerns about the gut microbiome and IQ. This move coincides with several states restricting fluoride in public water supplies. Experts are divided, with some questioning the strength of the evidence supporting the ban, while others emphasize the benefits of fluoride in preventing cavities, especially for children without access to fluoridated water. The FDA will review the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children by October 31. Dentists recommend fluoride supplements for children who live in areas without fluoridated water or who are at high risk of developing cavities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to address overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales, the government will implement limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison for breaching their licenses. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled to prison for license breaches will be released after a fixed 28-day period. This measure aims to free up around 1,400 prison places, providing time to overhaul the system, with the government planning to start work on three new prisons this year, funded by a Â£4.7 billion investment. These changes will not apply to offenders who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

          <p>A disturbing social media trend known as the "Chromebook challenge" is spreading across schools, where students deliberately short-circuit their laptops and record the resulting sparks and smoke for platforms like TikTok and Instagram. This dangerous activity has led to damaged computers, scorched floors and desks, classroom evacuations, and even criminal charges for some students. School districts are sending letters to families urging intervention, suspending students, and imposing fines for property damage. TikTok has stated they are removing content related to the challenge and redirecting search terms. The challenge involves inserting objects into laptop ports or smashing batteries to cause short circuits.</p>

          <p>Three Yale professors specializing in authoritarianism, Marci Shore, Timothy Snyder, and Jason Stanley, are moving to the University of Toronto due to concerns about democratic backsliding in the United States. They point to attacks on the rule of law, the courts, and universities as signs of a democratic emergency. Professor Stanley is leaving as a protest against attacks on civil liberties, while Professor Shore highlights the sharp regression of American democracy. Professor Snyder emphasizes supporting his family and teaching in an environment conducive to conversations about freedom.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a freeze on new enrollment of undocumented adult immigrants in the state's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, beginning no sooner than January 1, 2026. Additionally, he is proposing a $100 monthly premium for Medi-Cal enrollees aged 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status," effective January 1, 2027. Newsom's office attributes these measures partly to the economic impact of Trump's trade policies and higher-than-expected healthcare utilization. While Newsom affirms his commitment to healthcare for all Californians, he emphasizes the need for fiscal stability and preserving Medi-Cal's long-term viability.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is relocating the assembly of the President's Daily Intelligence Brief (PDB) from the CIA headquarters to her own complex. This decision comes as President Trump has questioned the necessity of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Gabbard also ordered the National Intelligence Council to relocate to her headquarters, aiming to strengthen the ODNI's role and oversight. Critics argue this move could reduce the ODNI's effectiveness by separating oversight from the CIA teams responsible for most of the work, potentially leading to inefficiencies and miscommunication.</p>

          <p>Investing $250,000 in an annuity could generate monthly payments ranging from approximately $1,200 to over $2,600, depending on factors such as age, gender, and the contract structure. Payments can vary significantly; for example, a 60-year-old man might receive $1,476 monthly, while a woman of the same age might receive slightly less due to longer life expectancy. Strategies to maximize annuity investments include shopping for the best rates, considering a laddering strategy, assessing health and family history, balancing guaranteed income with flexibility, and understanding tax implications. Carefully evaluating these factors can help individuals make informed decisions to secure stable retirement income (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living is widening, considering factors like technology, education, and healthcare. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finds that a "minimal quality of life" is unattainable for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. These households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, would need $67,000 to afford essential items. From 2001 to 2023, the cost of basic economic security doubled, with housing and healthcare costs surging, while median earnings for lower-income earners decreased.</p>

          <p>The UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has revealed its cast, featuring comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, singer Cat Burns, and Olympic diver Tom Daley. The celebrity season, set to air this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego, and public image to the popular format. Psychologists suggest comedians like Alan Carr are likely frontrunners due to their adaptability and ability to mask their true intentions, while sports stars may excel as faithfuls due to their teamwork and ability to handle pressure. The show's format involves a group of contestants, known as traitors, picking off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly "murders" - while the faithful try to work out their identity.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency, including auctioning off access to the president for investments in his $TRUMP coin, has raised significant conflict of interest concerns.

Concerns include foreign actors potentially buying influence through crypto investments and the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining facilities.

          <p>Recent ant smuggling cases in Kenya highlight a growing global problem with biopiracy and the illicit trade in wild animals. Four men were found guilty of attempting to smuggle ants, including valuable species like giant African harvester ants. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) views such smuggling as an infringement of the Nagoya Protocol, aimed at fairly sharing benefits from genetic resources. The illegal trade in insects poses ecological risks, as introduced species can disrupt ecosystems, and raises concerns about zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans.</p>

This perspective, originating from the Claremont Institute, has moved from academic circles to the White House. Courts have largely upheld birthright citizenship, citing the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court's consideration underscores the shift in legal discourse.</p>
