          <p>A new robotics store in Shenzhen, China, is pioneering a novel retail concept by allowing customers to rent or customize robots in addition to purchasing them. The store, named Future Era, showcases a variety of machines, from humanoid assistants to delivery bots, catering to company owners, investors, and the general public. This “6S” model expands on traditional sales and service by offering leasing and bespoke building options. With daily rental prices ranging from approximately $700 to $2,800, the initiative reflects China's rapidly expanding robotics industry and its push into consumer service markets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order modifying "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries, with new rates ranging from 10% to 41% effective August 7th. The order also introduces a steep 40% duty on all goods transshipped to evade tariffs, creating significant uncertainty in global trade. While some Asian nations received lower rates than previously announced, trading partners like Canada face increased duties, and those without deals will see a baseline 10% tariff. Analysts note this move heightens economic volatility and signals a continued departure from established trade norms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied the existence of any "backdoors" in its microchips following a summons from Chinese regulators over national security concerns. Officials in Beijing questioned the company about potential vulnerabilities in its H20 AI chips, which are designed for the Chinese market. The Cyberspace Administration of China cited reports of security risks and calls from U.S. lawmakers to embed tracking features in advanced chip exports. This development adds another geopolitical challenge for Nvidia as it navigates between Washington's export controls and the lucrative Chinese market.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's parliament has approved constitutional amendments that remove term limits and extend the presidential term from five to six years, allowing for indefinite reelection. The changes, passed with a strong majority by President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party, solidify his power after he won a second term in 2024 by bypassing a previous ban. The reforms also eliminate the need for a second-round runoff in presidential elections. Opposition lawmakers condemned the move as the death of democracy in the country, criticizing the swift process during a holiday period.</p>

          <p>Asian countries have responded differently to the latest U.S. tariff adjustments, which set new duty rates and a 40% penalty for transshipped goods. Cambodia and Thailand welcomed significant reductions in their tariff rates, with leaders expressing gratitude and citing benefits for their economies. In contrast, Taiwan faces a 20% tariff, which its president described as temporary while negotiations continue for a more favorable rate. Meanwhile, major economies like Japan and India are navigating their own deals and challenges, reflecting the widespread economic uncertainty created by the new U.S. trade policies.

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, is in a strong position to secure a spot on the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After shooting a 5-under 66 in the third round of the Junior PGA Championships, he is currently tied for second place at 12-under-par. The top two finishers at the Indiana tournament earn automatic spots on the prestigious team.

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade due to stalled contract extension negotiations. The 29-year-old star, who is in the final year of his contract, previously sat out the first four days of training camp to protest the lack of progress. After a career-best season with 1,096 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns, McLaurin is seeking a new deal reflecting his status as one of the league's top players. The two-time Pro Bowl selection's request puts pressure on the Commanders' management to either meet his demands or trade a key piece of their offense.</p>

This collaboration deepens ties that began in 1995, when Kuwait became the first Gulf state to sign a military cooperation agreement with Beijing.

The piece outlines specific tariffs imposed on goods like steel and cars, as well as country-specific rates for nations like Canada, the EU, and China.

He also cited the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for delaying widespread tariffs and asserted that his administration had already taken in hundreds of billions from China.

          <p>An office cleaner has described her terrifying experience during the recent deadly shooting in a Midtown Manhattan high-rise. Sebije Nelovic, 65, said she came face-to-face with the gunman on the 33rd floor after he shot through a glass door and pointed his AR-15-style rifle at her. She identified herself as a cleaning lady and ran to hide in a closet, where she prayed for hours as the shooting continued. The gunman killed four people, including an off-duty police officer, before taking his own life in what authorities believe was a misdirected attempt to target the NFL headquarters.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died this year, stated she wanted the sealed documents related to his case made public. In a television interview, her siblings said Giuffre fought for transparency and justice for victims until the very end. They also reacted to President Trump's recent comment that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, with her brother clarifying she was a person who was recruited, not an object to be stolen. The family also urged the president not to consider a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's PTI party to prison for their roles in the violent 2023 protests against the military. The sentences, including a 10-year term for opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, represent a significant blow to the opposition party. The protests erupted after Khan's arrest on corruption charges, leading to a widespread crackdown. PTI leaders have denounced the verdicts as politically motivated, calling it a "black day for democracy" and have vowed to challenge the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Annual undergraduate tuition fees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. Maintenance loans for student living costs have also been increased to help offset rising expenses. The change comes after universities warned of significant funding pressures due to high inflation and a decline in international student enrollment. The Department for Education stated the increases are in line with inflation, while critics note that student debt is likely to increase for future graduates under the current loan repayment system.

          <p>Despite having only a 1.3% chance of making the playoffs, the Los Angeles Angels chose to be modest buyers at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring two setup relievers and a struggling infielder. General manager Perry Minasian defended the decision, stating the goal was to keep the team competitive and provide young core players with experience in meaningful late-season games. This approach contrasts with rivals who made more significant moves. The article suggests the strategy reflects owner Arte Moreno's resistance to a full rebuild, even as the team's decade-long playoff drought continues.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has labeled his "gift to the country."

Trump stated that funding will come from himself and other "patriot donors." This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, creating a permanent legacy of his presidency.</p>

The successful IPO is a major win for firms like Index Ventures and Sequoia, providing a much-needed high-profile exit after a multi-year drought in the tech IPO market and signaling renewed investor appetite for new offerings.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to California's wildfire victim fund, which is at risk of being depleted by recent catastrophic fires. The plan proposes that customers of the state's three largest utilities contribute $9 billion by extending a monthly surcharge, with the other $9 billion coming from the utilities' shareholders. The original $21 billion fund was created in 2019 to protect utilities from bankruptcy after their equipment sparked fires. Consumer advocates and utility executives have both expressed criticism of the new proposal to shore up the fund. (not investment advice)</p>
