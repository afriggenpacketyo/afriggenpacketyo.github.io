          <h2>Number of Missing Persons in Texas Floods Drastically Reduced</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:22:22 EDT</div>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals listed as missing following recent devastating floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to intensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies that successfully verified the safety of many people previously unaccounted for. While this marks a positive development in the recovery efforts, the article notes the broader tragedy remains immense, with the total death toll from the statewide flooding standing at 134 people, including 107 in Kerr County alone. The community expresses gratitude for the tireless work of over a thousand emergency responders.</p>

          <h2>Wearable Tech and Google Data Prove Instrumental in Solving Wisconsin Murder Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:21:11 EDT</div>

          <p>The 2016 murder of Wisconsin mother Nicole Vander Heyden was solved through the crucial use of modern technology, which both exonerated an innocent man and convicted the killer. Initially, Vander Heyden's boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect until data from his Fitbit corroborated his alibi, proving he was home during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Burch, and subsequently utilized location data from his phone's Google Dashboard to place him at the crime scene, the body disposal site, and other key locations. This technological evidence was paramount in securing Burch's conviction for the brutal crime.</p>

          <p>Animal rescue volunteers discovered a distressing scene in a South Los Angeles home, finding over 400 guinea pigs living in severely overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Many of the animals, including pregnant and newborn guinea pigs, were suffering from medical issues like ringworm and open wounds, with inadequate food and water. The rescue was initiated after the tenant, facing eviction, needed to relocate what was initially believed to be 200 animals. Several rescue groups have begun removing the most vulnerable animals and are now urgently appealing to the public for adoptions, foster homes, and donations to cover medical care and supplies.</p>

          <p>Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt has responded to long-standing rumors of a feud with her co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar, stating she finds the speculation amusing as they have not spoken since the original film's release when she was 18. Hewitt downplayed any animosity, suggesting the narrative of conflict is often created by others. The rumors gained new life with the release of a new sequel in the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" franchise, which Hewitt and Gellar's husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., both star in. Despite attending the same premiere, the two actresses did not cross paths, which Gellar later explained on Instagram was due to the event's chaotic nature.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try victory over the US Eagles in a match marked by challenging humidity and two separate lightning delays in Washington D.C. Despite the disruptions, the mostly young English squad demonstrated superior precision, with hooker Curtis Langdon scoring the first try and captain George Ford guiding the offense effectively. The US team struggled to counter England's organized attacks, particularly their driving mauls. The event, part of a doubleheader, drew a record crowd for the preceding women's game, reflecting World Rugby's long-term investment in growing the sport's audience in the United States ahead of future World Cups.</p>

The WNBA Players Association, which opted out of the previous CBA, is seeking significant improvements, including a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and enhanced benefits. With negotiations at a standstill and a large discrepancy reported between the players' demands and the league's offers, prominent players have raised the possibility of a walkout if a deal is not reached by October.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, is facing a catastrophic water crisis and could become the first modern capital city to run completely dry, according to a report from Mercy Corps. Decades of population growth, the climate crisis, and unregulated over-extraction have severely depleted the city's groundwater, which is its primary water source. Residents now face a daily struggle, paying high prices for water, which is often contaminated and leads to widespread illness. The crisis disproportionately affects women and children, who spend hours fetching water, and threatens to trigger a broader economic and humanitarian collapse in the politically unstable nation.</p>

This behavior highlights public frustration with the so-called "kiss-and-fly" tariffs, which critics call extortionate and greedy.

However, others, particularly teachers, contend that the long break is essential for them to recharge and plan for the upcoming school year.

          <h2>UK Government Considers Policy Changes to Encourage Investment Over Cash Savings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has signaled a push to encourage savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments to stimulate the economy. The government plans to launch new advertising campaigns and have banks send targeted messages to savers, arguing that the benefits of investing are often overshadowed by risk warnings. The debate includes the possibility of altering the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize a shift toward investment ISAs. Critics, however, warn this approach could backfire if new investors face short-term losses and stress the need for better financial education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, private members-only clubs is rising in India, catering to the country's growing class of young, self-made entrepreneurs and creative professionals. These clubs, such as the successful Soho House in Mumbai, offer a more relaxed and contemporary alternative to the formal, colonial-era gymkhanas traditionally favored by the old-money elite. With high demand and long waiting lists at older establishments, these new spaces provide a haven for networking, business, and leisure. While still exclusive and expensive, their membership is based more on personal accomplishment and creative merit rather than family legacy or inherited status.</p>

          <p>A viral image purporting to show Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with a young girl has been confirmed to be a fake, created using artificial intelligence. The fact-check points to several clear indicators of AI generation within the image, including a deformed hand on the girl, a distorted jacket sleeve on Trump, and malformed faces in the background. The image has resurfaced multiple times on social media, often used to fuel political narratives. While some genuine photos of Trump and Epstein together do exist, this specific, widely circulated picture is not authentic and serves as an example of AI-driven disinformation.</p>

The podcast also explores the educational achievement gap, where boys are increasingly falling behind girls in literacy and other areas. It concludes by featuring diverse male voices discussing the meaning of masculinity in 2025 and the need for more authentic identities.</p>

          <p>After years of rapid growth, the popularity of learning Mandarin Chinese is waning in several Western nations, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. Recent data from universities and secondary schools in these countries shows a significant decline in language course enrollments, with US university numbers down 25% from their 2013 peak. This "huge shift" marks a notable reversal of a trend that was once fueled by the perception of Mandarin as the language of the future due to China's economic ascent. The decline suggests a changing landscape in global linguistic and cultural priorities among students.</p>

Despite the odd setback, he finished the day with a strong score of 66, leaving him at eight under par.
