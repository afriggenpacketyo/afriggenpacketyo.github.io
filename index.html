          <p>Chinese media reported that President Trump and President Xi Jinping held a phone call to discuss trade relations between the two countries. The call occurred amidst ongoing trade tensions and accusations of breached agreements between Washington and Beijing. This conversation is considered a potential step towards de-escalating the trade war that has threatened global trade flows. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment, leaving the specifics of the discussion undisclosed, however, the discussion has been widely seen as an endorsement for de-escalating the trade war. The tone of the call remains undisclosed, so a full evaluation of the call is difficult. Optimism surrounding the resolution of US-China trade tensions is cautiously positive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 2% in an effort to stimulate the eurozone's struggling economy. This is the eighth rate cut in the past year, as fiscal policymakers seek to bolster the economy amid broader economic uncertainty. The reduction comes after President Trump's threat to raise tariffs on goods from the European Union, adding further pressure to the economic situation. The ECB's move reflects concerns about economic growth in the face of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national accused of attacking demonstrators in Colorado. The order came after the family was taken into custody by ICE agents, with the Department of Homeland Security initiating removal proceedings.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit saw a significant reduction in April, primarily due to a sharp decrease in imports following President Trump's escalation of tariffs. The trade gap fell by more than half, registering at approximately $61 billion compared to $140 billion the previous month. Imports dropped by 16% as trade barriers took effect, though some firms had previously stockpiled supply in anticipation of the levies. While Trump views tariffs as a means to reduce the nation's trade deficit, many economists argue that the deficit reflects the consumer-driven nature of the U.S. economy. The long-term effects of these trade policies remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>This article examines how tariffs could affect the prices of goods like shoes and sweaters, particularly those imported from China and Vietnam. Retail consultancy group AlixPartners created pricing models to estimate potential price increases under President Trump's tariff proposals. The models suggest that under current tariffs, prices of goods made in China could rise by about 19%, while higher tariffs could lead to increases of up to 90%. Retailers are exploring various strategies to mitigate these costs, but consumers may still face higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, partial restrictions are in place for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The policy, which takes effect on Monday, includes exceptions for U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with proof of identity.

          <p>This article discusses how the traditional pressure to achieve a "summer body" has evolved into a year-round focus on fitness and appearance. Social media trends, workout methods, and the rise of weight-loss drugs have contributed to this constant pursuit of an ideal body image. While the body positivity movement made some strides, the pressure to conform to narrow beauty ideals persists, leading to fatigue and increased body-image issues. The author questions whether this shift has decreased the pressure or simply replaced it with something more toxic, suggesting that bodies have become never-ending projects.</p>

          <h2>England Expands Free School Meal Eligibility</h2>

          <p>The government of England has announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 pupils whose parents receive Universal Credit, regardless of their income. This change, set to take effect in September 2026, aims to help families who need it most and is considered a down payment on child poverty. The government has allocated Â£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, and the move is expected to lift 100,000 children out of poverty. While praised as a welcome step, some argue that further action, such as abolishing the two-child benefit cap, is needed to address child poverty effectively.</p>

          <p>Red Sea marine traffic has increased by 60% since August 2024, reaching 36-37 ships per day, after Yemen's Houthis narrowed their targets following a ceasefire deal with the U.S., according to the EU's Aspides naval mission commander. However, traffic remains below the average of 72-75 ships per day seen before the Houthi attacks began in November 2023. The mission, tasked with safeguarding navigation and monitoring illegal arms shipments, has provided close protection to 476 ships and shot down 18 drones. Despite the increased traffic, the commander cannot guarantee that merchant ships won't be attacked, and some companies are deterred by the mission's limited capacity.</p>

          <p>New studies indicate that China is rapidly gaining an edge over the U.S. in biotechnology, particularly for drug and agricultural development. A Harvard Belfer Center report suggests that China has the most immediate opportunity to overtake the United States in this sector. The U.S. National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology has urged the government to invest at least $15 billion over the next five years to support the domestic biotech sector. U.S. and European pharmaceutical giants have already spent billions to acquire China-developed drugs, underscoring China's growing biotech capabilities.</p>
