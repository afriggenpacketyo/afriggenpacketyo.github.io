          <p>Egypt's foreign minister has assured Greece that Egypt is committed to preserving the spiritual and religious significance of Saint Catherine's Monastery, a part of the Greek Orthodox church. The reassurance came after an Egyptian court ruling raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders about the monastery's ownership claims to the land it sits on. While the court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites, it ruled the land was public, prompting Greece to seek guarantees for the site's protection. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated the ruling would not affect the site's spiritual value and religious standing, with both countries agreeing to cooperate on protecting the monastery's rights and legal status.</p>

Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students following the October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel.

          <p>President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" is projected to increase the national debt by $3 trillion, or $5 trillion if made permanent, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The estimate is based on the House-passed bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which projects it would add more than $2.4 trillion to primary deficits before interest over 10 years. Some lawmakers, including Senator Rand Paul, have voiced opposition to the legislation, while top Democrats claim the bill would cause the deaths of an estimated 51,000 Americans due to changes to the federal healthcare system. Elon Musk, Trump's former head of the Department of Government Efficiency, is also against the bill (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ordered the Trump administration to provide due process to over 100 Venezuelan men deported to a supermax prison in El Salvador. Judge James Boasberg found that the men, deported under the Alien Enemies Act, were "plainly deprived" of their rights. The Trump administration argued the act allowed them to deport suspected gang members, but Boasberg ruled the men must be allowed to challenge their removal. Concerns have been raised about the government's claims that all deportees are gangsters, with evidence suggesting many have no gang affiliations.</p>

Hiring was described as "little changed" across most of the Fed's districts, with lower labor demand and reports of layoffs in certain sectors.

The fungus causes a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, and farmers rely on various methods to mitigate the risk, including fungicides.

McMahon defended the proposed cuts, arguing that the federal government should not be solely responsible for student loans and that colleges need to have "skin in the game." Democrats raised concerns about cuts to mental health programs and the elimination of TRIO, while Republicans emphasized the need for workforce development without federal funding.</p>

Observers caution that divergent world views and competing national interests could undercut Beijing’s vision of a multipolar world.

These pardons include those for former Republican politicians convicted of tax evasion, individuals connected to Trump's political campaigns, and those involved in the January 6th riot. Critics argue that this practice undermines the rule of law by signaling that loyalty to the regime is a shield against criminal punishment. The use of clemency is supposed to reflect mercy and repair communities, but this has been twisted into a tool for regime control.</p>
