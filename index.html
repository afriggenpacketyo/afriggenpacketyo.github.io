        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A flight passenger has defended the controversial practice of "gate lice," sparking a debate on travel etiquette. The trend gained attention last year when American Airlines began using technology to prevent passengers from boarding before their designated zone. The passenger argued that confusing announcements and poorly placed signage often force travelers to crowd the gate area to understand boarding instructions. Etiquette experts suggest that passengers should wait their turn unless they have a tight connection or are traveling with someone who needs assistance, as airlines are forced to create rules to manage those who jump ahead in line. The article highlights varying experiences among travelers regarding gate announcements and boarding procedures.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has echoed President Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, labeling the Fed's refusal to do so as "monetary malpractice." Vance's statement followed a report indicating that consumer price index increased by just 0.1%, with annual inflation levels standing above the Fed's 2% target. Trump has been pressuring Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates, particularly in light of easing inflation and a moderating labor market. The FOMC is expected to make its interest rate decision soon, with markets anticipating a potential rate cut in September, as the administration emphasizes the need for lower rates amid ongoing economic uncertainty.

The study reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the sensory and motor experiences necessary to understand concepts like flowers in their full richness. AI's creativity is described as "hollow and shallow" because it cannot replicate the depth and emotional connection humans have with sensory experiences. Experts suggest that future AI models augmented with sensor data and robotics may improve, but will still lack the human element of memory and self.</p>

          <p>President Trump's political team has approached Texas Republicans about redrawing the state's congressional map to protect the GOP's narrow House majority. Discussions are preliminary, with potential targets including up to five seats currently held by Democrats. However, Republicans acknowledge that redistricting could backfire, leading to legal challenges or Democratic gains in a wave election. The move indicates Republican concerns about losing seats in the upcoming midterms, as the current map was drawn by Republicans in 2021.</p>

          <h2>EU Assesses Potential Emergency Measures Amid Surge in Chinese Exports</h2>

          <p>The European Union is evaluating whether the surge in Chinese exports to the bloc, coinciding with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, necessitates emergency measures. Despite a significant drop in China's shipments to the U.S. and a rise in exports to France and Germany, the European Commission states it's "too early to conclude" trade diversion is occurring. The EU is monitoring trade patterns to determine if the increase in Chinese exports causes harm to EU industries. The new customs surveillance system will aid in detecting trade diversions, but more data is needed to establish a trend.</p>

The Â£3 bus fare cap will continue, and more pensioners will receive winter fuel payments. Changes to energy bills are also expected due to investments in nuclear power and home insulation.</p>
