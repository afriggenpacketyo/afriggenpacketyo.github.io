          <p>Two men have been sentenced to decades in prison for their roles in the deadliest human smuggling event in U.S. history, where 53 migrants died in a sweltering tractor-trailer in Texas three years ago. Felipe Orduna-Torres, identified as the operation's leader, received two life sentences, while his top assistant, Armando Gonzales-Ortega, was sentenced to over 87 years. The migrants, from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, had been locked in a trailer with no working air conditioning during a three-hour drive. This sentencing marks a significant step toward justice for the victims of the tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred a final decision on Louisiana's controversial congressional map, opting to schedule the case for reargument in its next term. The map, which creates a second majority-Black district, was challenged by a group of voters who claim it constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. This legal battle highlights the difficulty states face in complying with the Voting Rights Act without overly relying on race, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. For now, the map with two majority-Black districts will remain in place, with potential implications for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority Congress granted to federal courts. This decision reins in a judicial tool that has frequently stalled major executive actions, altering the balance of power between the judicial and executive branches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deeper within the U.S. economy, the effects of trade tariffs are becoming more apparent as sticker prices on a range of consumer goods are actively being increased. Distribution centers report re-ticketing millions of items with price hikes of 8% to 15%, a practice not seen on this scale since the pandemic. Simultaneously, retailers and manufacturers are shrinking their inventory footprints to mitigate risks from trade uncertainty and perceived consumer softness, holding less stock on hand. This combination of rising prices and reduced product availability points toward growing inflationary pressure and a potentially weaker holiday shopping season.</p>

          <p>In a decision viewed as a significant victory for presidential authority, the Supreme Court curtailed the power of lower courts to issue sweeping injunctions against executive orders. The ruling allows President Trump's administration to move forward on its birthright citizenship policy for now, and it also strengthens the executive branch's ability to implement other policies previously blocked by federal judges. While legal battles over the specific policies will continue, the decision gives current and future presidents more immediate power to enact their agendas without being halted by a single court.</p>

          <p>The third and final season of Netflix's "Squid Game" has shifted its focus from sharp capitalist satire to a broader, more superficial critique of human nature, according to this review. While the first season used its deadly children's games to explore themes of social inequality, the new season's challenges are seen as plot devices designed for shallow thrills. The increased role of the villainous "VIPs" and the introduction of a newborn baby as a competitor are criticized for turning the drama into a parody of itself. Despite compelling performances and impressive set pieces, the show is said to have abandoned its original, richer themes.</p>

The damages sought are nearly identical to the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit.

          <h2>Explainer: When Does Credit Card Debt Become Too High for Settlement?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 12:23:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While debt settlement can help individuals resolve significant credit card debt for less than the full amount owed, there is a practical limit to its effectiveness. This article suggests that settlement works best for unsecured debts between $7,500 and $75,000. Once debt exceeds $100,000, the process becomes riskier, as creditors are more likely to pursue legal action rather than negotiate. Furthermore, the large lump-sum payments required for high-debt settlements are often unrealistic for individuals to save, and the fees charged by relief companies can become prohibitively expensive, making alternatives like bankruptcy potentially more efficient.

          <p>A federal jury in New Orleans has ordered a Catholic religious order to pay nearly $2.4 million in damages to a man who was sexually abused in the late 1960s by a member of the order. The verdict is a landmark case in Louisiana, being the first of its kind since a state law was upheld allowing survivors to seek damages regardless of when the abuse occurred. The plaintiff, John Lousteau, was abused at a summer camp run by the Holy Cross order. This significant award could influence future settlements, including those in the New Orleans archdiocese's ongoing bankruptcy case involving hundreds of other survivors.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Toni at Random," and a related essay explore the pivotal but lesser-known career of Toni Morrison as a book editor at Random House in the 1970s. Before achieving global fame for her own novels, Morrison championed a generation of Black writers, including Angela Davis and Huey P. Newton. She fought to publish works that were uncompromising in their vision for Black people, resisting industry pressure to cater to white audiences. This work established that powerful literature written for a specific community could achieve universal acclaim, reshaping the publishing landscape and defining a legacy of artistic integrity.</p>

          <p>A new trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans increase their savings in response to economic anxieties over inflation, tariffs, and job security. The U.S. personal saving rate has risen sharply this year, reaching 4.5% in May, a significant increase from 3.5% in December. This shift away from post-pandemic "revenge spending" is reflected in social media trends like "no buy" challenges and a renewed focus on building emergency funds. Financial experts note that this cautious consumer behavior is a defensive move to create a financial cushion against potential future cost increases and market volatility.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has altered its controversial welfare reform bill following a significant rebellion from within the Labour Party. The initial plan would have applied stricter criteria for receiving Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to all claimants. After facing opposition from about 120 of his own MPs, Starmer announced the new rules will now only apply to new claimants, not existing ones. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health component of Universal Credit and will fast-track a support package to help people find work, though some MPs still plan to vote against the bill.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the nature of rules and societal trust, using a personal anecdote about a reckless driver at a crosswalk as a metaphor for larger geopolitical events, such as the U.S. pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. The author argues that while rules are essential for society, it is naive to expect everyone, from individuals to nations, to follow them. The piece suggests that assuming the worst and expecting people to fail is a more practical, if cynical, worldview. This mindset encourages proactive measures rather than relying on the hope that others will act honorably.</p>

CEO Tim Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement to lead the effort, has promised an aggressive strategy that includes reintroducing Hemi V-8 engines, offering an industry-leading warranty, and returning to NASCAR. The brand has lost significant market share to competitors, a situation Kuniskis attributes to past issues with pricing and a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500. The revival plan aims to restore dealer confidence and reclaim a market share of over 20% for its full-size trucks.</p>

For decades, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has urged the FAA to require car seats for children under two, citing the risk of injury during severe turbulence or other emergencies. However, the FAA has not enacted such a rule, reportedly concerned that requiring parents to buy an extra ticket would lead more families to drive, a statistically less safe mode of travel.</p>

A coalition representing the adult entertainment industry argued the law unconstitutionally burdens adults' free speech and creates privacy risks.
