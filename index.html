          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of all his scheduled concerts due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. The article indicates that Joel, age 76, is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised by his doctors to refrain from performing during his recovery. Normal pressure hydrocephalus involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, potentially leading to brain damage and issues with walking, bladder control, and cognitive function. Early diagnosis and treatment, often involving surgery to drain the excess fluid, offer the best chance of recovery for the singer, who previously underwent surgery in March.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended a block on the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the Department of Government Efficiency effort, led by Elon Musk.

The judge emphasized that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates and that a president cannot initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without congressional partnership.

The article explains that the bill's tax cuts favor business owners, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas, while reductions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP would hurt low earners. The Congressional Budget Office estimates income for the bottom 10% of households would fall, while those in the top 10% would see an income boost.

          <p>The White House has rejected a finding by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that the Trump administration is breaking the law by withholding funds directed by Congress. The article reports that the GAO concluded the administration violated the Impoundment Control Act by blocking spending on electric vehicle charging stations. The White House budget office dismissed the GAO report, arguing that it interferes with managing taxpayer dollars effectively. The dispute is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court, as the Trump administration challenges the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields have fallen as investors react to President Trump's renewed trade war threats, seeking safety in bonds. The article notes that Trump proposed a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., causing market uncertainty. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 3 basis points to 5.03%, while the 10-year Treasury shed 5 basis points to 4.505%. These moves followed concerns earlier in the week about Trump's tax bill worsening the U.S. deficit, compounded by Moody's downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating.</p>

While MRI scans are better at detecting more tumors, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective. The scans were administered to women with dense breast tissue who had already undergone mammograms with normal results, suggesting a potential improvement in screening protocols.</p>
