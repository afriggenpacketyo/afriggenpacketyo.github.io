          <p>Human remains were found at the crash site of an Air Self-Defense Force training jet in central Japan, where it crashed into a large reservoir earlier this week. The T-4 jet, carrying two personnel, disappeared from radar shortly after takeoff from Komaki Air Base in Aichi Prefecture, prompting a search for the missing crew members. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani reported the body was severely damaged and the ASDF has identified the two crew members as Capt. Takuji Ioka, 31, and 1st Lt. Shota Amitani, 29. The ASDF also found what appears to be the plane's engine and helmets at Lake Iruka.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales debated proposed changes to a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny and numerous amendments since passing its first stage in November. Key issues being considered include ensuring no obligation for medical staff to participate and preventing them from raising the option of assisted dying first. The debate also involves emotional speeches from MPs sharing personal experiences with terminal illnesses, highlighting the deep divisions and strong opinions surrounding this issue within Parliament.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit train engineers initiated a strike after failing to reach a contract agreement with NJ Transit officials, causing commuter train service to cease and impacting an estimated 350,000 commuters. Negotiations between the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) union and NJ Transit officials were close but ultimately unsuccessful, prompting the strike to begin at 12:01 a.m. on Friday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri have encouraged commuters to work from home and anticipate resuming negotiations on Sunday morning. The strike has led to the development of a contingency plan, but it is expected to only accommodate approximately 20% of current rail customers.</p>

          <p>Germany and the UK are strengthening their military cooperation with plans to jointly develop long-range precision weapons to protect Europe from potential attacks. The two countries formalized their partnership in the Trinity House Agreement, aiming to protect the North Atlantic and North Sea. This includes joint operations with submarines and maritime reconnaissance aircraft, and the development of precision weapons with a range exceeding 2000 kilometers. The collaboration also extends to developing compatible weapons systems and addressing the need for common standards in European defense.</p>

Hours before her death, MÃ¡rquez expressed fear in her livestream, stating, "Maybe they were going to kill me." Two men posing as delivery drivers arrived at the beauty salon where she worked, and one of them shot her in the head and chest while she was live.

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators commenced in Istanbul, Turkey, marking the first such engagement since the start of the war, but expectations for significant progress remain low. Despite this, President Trump and other U.S. officials have expressed support for the negotiations. Both sides have taken steps to be seen as responding to Washington's call for direct talks. However, the talks are viewed by some as an attempt by Putin to maintain Trump's attention and potentially shift blame for lack of progress onto Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Latin American leaders have spent millions hiring Washington's top lobbyists to influence the Trump administration, seeking free-trade deals, security assistance, and energy investments. At least 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have registered top officials as foreign principals under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (Fara). El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has seen significant returns from his lobbying efforts, securing meetings with Trump and a nuclear energy deal.

          <p>Russ Vought, a key figure in Project 2025, is poised to continue President Trump's efforts to dismantle the federal workforce after Elon Musk's departure from government cost-cutting initiatives. Vought, known for his Christian nationalism and ideological drive, aims to consolidate power for the president and implement changes outlined in Project 2025. He has expressed a strong distaste for civil servants and seeks to eliminate job protections for career civil servants, replacing them with loyalists. Vought's approach contrasts with Musk's, focusing on reshaping the government to align with his ideological vision.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding whether President Trump can end birthright citizenship, focusing on the broader issue of whether a single lower-court judge can block presidential policies nationwide. The administration argues that courts should only apply injunctions to individual cases, while others contend that this would burden the public and the courts. The justices explored potential compromises, such as limiting universal injunctions to specific circumstances. The decision could significantly impact the power of the judicial branch to check the president's agenda.</p>
