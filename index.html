          <p>China strongly condemned the newly announced US tariffs, denouncing them as violating international trade rules and undermining legitimate interests.  The Ministry of Commerce vowed to implement resolute countermeasures against these sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. This action follows President Trump's imposition of steep tariff rates on numerous countries, including a significant increase on Chinese imports. The announcement triggered immediate reactions from other nations, with some planning retaliatory measures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a delay in the closure of the de minimis trade loophole, granting businesses and customs officials more time to prepare. Initially set to end abruptly, this loophole allowed duty-free entry for shipments under $800, largely benefiting Chinese online retailers.  The delayed closure will now impose a duty of either 30% of the value or $25 per item, increasing to $50 by June 1st. This decision aims to address concerns about unfair competition, counterfeit goods, and the smuggling of illicit substances.</p>

          <p>The US Senate passed a resolution to block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, demonstrating rare bipartisan opposition to his trade policies.  Four Republican senators joined Democrats in supporting the measure, defying Trump's pressure.  The resolution targets Trump's use of a national emergency declaration on fentanyl to justify the tariffs. While the resolution is unlikely to pass the House, it highlights growing concerns about the economic and geopolitical ramifications of Trump's trade war.</p>
