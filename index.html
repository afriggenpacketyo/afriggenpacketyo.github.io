        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance has accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" in the ongoing government shutdown stalemate. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Vance asserted that the White House will not negotiate over healthcare policy until Democratic leaders, particularly Senator Chuck Schumer, agree to reopen the government. He framed the Democratic demand for an extension of health insurance tax credits as an unreasonable ultimatum, while defending the administration's handling of federal worker layoffs as a necessary consequence of the shutdown initiated by the "far-left." The conflict continues with no clear resolution as both parties exchange blame.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's stance on Russia, suggesting its actions are insufficient despite recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries. He also raised serious legal concerns about recent U.S. lethal strikes against alleged drug-dealing vessels in the Caribbean, labeling them as potentially "illegal killings" without proper congressional oversight or clear legal justification. Himes further criticized the Republican-led government for the ongoing shutdown, highlighting the financial strain on his constituents, including National Guard members who will miss their paychecks while being deployed.</p>

          <p>Following the Colorado Buffaloes' 24-17 victory over No. 22 Iowa State, head coach Deion Sanders appeared perplexed by the Big 12 Conference's policy that could result in a significant fine for fans rushing the field. The celebration, which occurred after Colorado ended a losing streak against ranked opponents, may cost the university $50,000. Sanders voiced his support for the fans' enthusiastic display, stating he loves to see the students celebrate and questioning the rationale behind such a hefty penalty. This potential fine follows previous penalties the university has faced for fan and crowd behavior.</p>

In response, authorities are warning residents, activating emergency services, and some airports are reporting delays and cancellations.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has responded defiantly to President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, stating that while Beijing does not want a trade war, it is "not afraid of it." The statement came after China imposed new export controls on rare earth minerals, a move Beijing defends as legitimate under international law. Chinese officials accused the U.S. of applying a "textbook double standard" by using national security as a pretext for discriminatory trade actions. The escalating rhetoric has shaken global markets and casts uncertainty on a potential upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>The government of Madagascar has announced that an illegal attempt to seize power by force is underway, escalating a period of political turmoil.

          <p>China has issued a stern warning that it will take "resolute measures" to retaliate if the Trump administration follows through on its threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. The threat from President Trump, made in response to Beijing's new export controls on rare-earth minerals, caused significant drops in global financial markets, wiping an estimated $2 trillion off U.S. stock values. China's commerce ministry defended its export controls as legitimate and blamed Washington for escalating the trade dispute. The standoff creates fresh uncertainty for investors who had largely moved on from the trade war narrative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stephanie Rogers, a microbiologist with the FDA for 16 years, is facing significant hardship due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. To prepare, she moved in with her mother, pre-filled her children's prescriptions, and made a withdrawal from her retirement fund. The current shutdown feels more precarious than previous ones due to threats of permanent layoffs and denial of backpay, creating immense uncertainty about her job, health insurance, and future. The situation has caused emotional distress for her entire family, with her daughter asking if she still has a job, illustrating the profound personal impact of the political stalemate.</p>

          <p>During a rare press conference in Delhi attended by female journalists, the Taliban's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, was confronted with questions about the ban on education and work for women in Afghanistan. Muttaqi claimed the education of girls has been "postponed" by order of the supreme leader and is not considered "haram" (forbidden by Islamic law). This event followed an earlier male-only press conference from which women journalists were excluded, an act Muttaqi dismissed as a "technical issue." His comments do little to address international criticism of the Taliban's severe restrictions on women's rights since their return to power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The appointment of conservative commentator Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is not a sudden shift but the result of a 50-year plan to make media more friendly to corporate power, argues the article. This strategy was outlined in the 1971 Powell Memo, which called for corporations to monitor and influence news coverage to be more pro-business. The article reveals that CBS executives were involved in implementing this plan in the 1970s, aiming to "correct the situation" of critical journalism. Weiss's ascent is presented as the modern outcome of this long-term effort to destroy accountability journalism and align major news outlets with powerful interests.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a public warning to propaganda staff and other classified units to tighten controls on confidential information. The agency cited several recent instances where state secrets were leaked through news media interviews and other public-facing communications. An article from an affiliated social media account cautioned that propaganda workers, in their pursuit of novelty and publicity, were sometimes neglecting confidentiality reviews. This laxity, it stated, endangers national security, as public information from state-run entities is closely scrutinized by foreign entities seeking intelligence.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that the prime minister's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, had no role in the "substance or the evidence" of the recently collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The charges were dropped after prosecutors said the government failed to provide necessary evidence confirming China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. Conservatives have suggested Powell, who has advocated for closer ties with Beijing, was responsible for withholding this evidence. The government insists it could only act based on the official policy designation at the time.</p>

The author suggests that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting discrimination is valuable, even if flawed. Rather than simply offsetting purchases with donations, the columnist recommends engaging with the material critically and in community with others. This approach allows fans to continue interrogating the text's problematic elements while appreciating its positive messages, transforming passive consumption into a more active and socially conscious practice.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has asserted that the precedent set in 2011 should compel the UK government to grant another independence referendum if his party wins a majority in the next Holyrood election. In 2011, an SNP majority led to the 2014 referendum, a basis Swinney believes gives his party a strong negotiating position. He dismissed the UK Labour government's opposition to a new poll as "fatuous," arguing that precedent is a significant factor in legal and political considerations. Swinney is framing the next election as a de-facto vote on independence to address Scotland's stagnant living standards.</p>
