          <p>SpaceX has launched its 33rd commercial resupply mission, sending a Dragon capsule with 2.5 tons of supplies and scientific equipment to the International Space Station. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral early Sunday, successfully delivering its payload into orbit. In addition to crew supplies and research projects, the capsule is equipped with an add-on thruster kit designed to help maintain the station's altitude. This new capability will allow the Dragon spacecraft to assist with periodic re-boosts, a function predominantly handled by Russian spacecraft until now.</p>

The victim has not yet been identified, and investigators are working to determine how long the remains had been at the location. The gruesome nature of the discovery has shocked local workers and residents, who described the scene as the next level of violence for the city.</p>

          <p>A German rescue charity reported the drowning of three young sisters, aged nine, 11, and 17, after the overcrowded rubber boat they were on took on water in the central Mediterranean. The vessel, which departed from Libya, was overwhelmed by high waves, leading to the tragedy. The girls' mother and brother were among the 65 survivors rescued by the charity RESQSHIP. The incident highlights the extreme dangers migrants face while attempting to cross the sea to Europe, with the UN reporting over 700 such deaths in the central Mediterranean this year alone.</p>

          <p>Former CIA Director and retired General David Petraeus stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the main barrier to achieving peace in Ukraine. In an interview, Petraeus expressed doubt that a productive meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would occur, asserting that Putin has no intention of ending the war without territorial concessions. He argued that the United States should increase its support for Ukraine to alter the dynamics of the conflict. Petraeus suggested lifting weapon restrictions and seizing frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with more substantial aid.</p>

          <p>Despite stringent US sanctions intended to curb its growth, China's nuclear power industry has advanced to become a global benchmark for efficiency and scale. The blacklisting of entities like the China General Nuclear Power Group has isolated China, forcing it to develop a self-reliant and highly advanced supply chain. Now, as the US and Europe face delays and rising costs in their own nuclear projects, they are unable to leverage China's industrial capacity. This situation has created a paradox where sanctions have not only failed to hinder China but may also be stalling the West's own transition to atomic energy.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have heavily bombarded northern and eastern parts of Gaza City with air and tank strikes as they prepare for a large-scale ground offensive. The military has also returned to the Jabalia refugee camp to destroy buildings, preventing Hamas from regrouping in the area. The Hamas-run health ministry reported 64 people were killed in the past 24 hours, raising the total since the war began to over 62,600. The planned operation has intensified pressure on the nearly one million Palestinians still in the city, with the UN warning of a horrific humanitarian impact.</p>

          <p>The 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security is projected to be around 2.7%, according to the Senior Citizens League, an increase from earlier forecasts due to persistent inflation. While a higher COLA means increased benefits, it also reflects rising living costs that may outpace the adjustment. A recent study indicates that Social Security benefits have already lost 20% of their purchasing power since 2010, suggesting that the annual COLA has consistently struggled to keep up with the actual expenses faced by retirees.

          <p>The British government is planning a major overhaul of the asylum appeals system to address what Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called "unacceptable delays." A new independent body of adjudicators will be established to handle appeals more swiftly than the current court system, where the average wait time is over a year. The move aims to reduce the number of failed asylum seekers housed in hotels at taxpayer expense, which currently stands at 32,000. Critics, however, argue that the focus should be on making correct initial decisions to prevent the need for so many appeals.</p>

Arrupe, a revered figure whose cause for canonization opened in 2019, was informed of the risks but did not definitively block the ordination.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has adopted a more combative political style to counter the Trump administration, employing social media trolling, lawsuits, and a bold redistricting proposal. Newsom is pushing a special election ballot measure to redraw congressional maps, a direct response to Republican gerrymandering in Texas, which could help Democrats retake the U.S. House. This aggressive "fight fire with fire" approach marks a strategic shift for Newsom, who is positioning himself as a national Democratic brawler. The move is seen as a high-stakes gamble that could define his political future ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

These factors could allow Eli Lilly to achieve greater market share in the lucrative weight-loss drug space, which is eager for more convenient and accessible treatment options.</p>

          <p>A new meme, the "performative male," is gaining traction among Gen Z on TikTok and has inspired real-life contests across the country. The term describes a man who adopts an alternative, intellectual, and "soft" aesthetic—such as carrying tote bags, reading feminist literature, and listening to indie female artists—often to attract progressive women. While largely a lighthearted trend poking fun at a specific subculture, it also taps into a deeper skepticism about authenticity.

          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared an honest one-year review, noting that while his savings on gas were less than expected at $334, the real financial benefit came from reduced maintenance costs. He contrasted the $600 he spent on two new tires for the Tesla with the tens of thousands he had spent on repairs for his previous car. The owner concluded that the longer he drives the electric vehicle, the more he will save on maintenance, a sentiment echoed by other EV owners.
