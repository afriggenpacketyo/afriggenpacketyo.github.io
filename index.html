          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:36:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, along with independent MP Zarah Sultana, has launched a new political party aimed at challenging the "rich and powerful." The yet-to-be-named party positions itself as a grassroots, community-led alternative to what Corbyn describes as the "control freaks" of the Labour Party. It intends to campaign on issues like wealth redistribution, child poverty, and anti-war stances, positioning itself to the left of Labour. The new entity plans an inaugural conference in the autumn to define its policies and may first contest local elections in May 2026.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:35:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant jump, positioning it as a new meme stock fueled by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The rally was partly sparked by the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, focusing on the brand's denim line. The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its tradable shares sold short, made it an attractive target for traders looking to initiate a short squeeze. This surge provides a potential reprieve for the stock, which had fallen about 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge in Bali has sentenced three British citizens to a 12-month prison term for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Indonesia, allowing them to avoid a potential death penalty. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float were arrested in February after the drugs, valued at around £300,000, were discovered disguised in powdered dessert packets. Factoring in time already served, the trio could be released by early 2026. Indonesia has notoriously strict drug laws but has maintained a temporary halt on executions since 2017.</p>

While companies like Delta and Amazon deny using personal data to set individual prices, investigations have found other retailers like Kroger and Target offering varied prices to different customers.

          <p>Labubu dolls, a line of "ugly-cute" vinyl figures from Chinese retailer Pop Mart, have exploded into a global craze, generating significant revenue and a fanatical following. The toys, sold in "blind boxes" that create a surprise element for collectors, accounted for over $423 million of Pop Mart's $1.8 billion in revenue last year. This marks one of China's first homegrown global toy megahits, with 40% of Labubu sales occurring outside the country. The phenomenon has led to long queues and online mania as collectors, like those in the U.S., embrace the thrill of the hunt.</p>

The statement comes as the September 17 divestment deadline approaches, a result of a 2024 law passed by Congress. Lutnick specified that American ownership of the technology and control over the algorithm are key conditions for any deal to proceed.</p>

Zelensky stated the new bill is "balanced" and will protect the institutions from Russian influence, effectively backtracking on the previous law.

          <p>This article outlines the potential loss of assets when filing for personal bankruptcy, distinguishing between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Under Chapter 7, a trustee can liquidate non-exempt assets—such as second homes, valuable vehicles, or collectibles—to repay creditors, although federal and state exemptions often protect primary homes and personal necessities. In contrast, Chapter 13 involves a three-to-five-year repayment plan that typically allows the filer to keep their property. The article also suggests exploring alternatives like debt management plans or consolidation loans, which can provide relief without the same risk to one's assets. (not investment advice)</p>
