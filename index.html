          <p>The Trump administration proactively informed several U.S. allies in the Middle East about Israel's impending strikes on Iran.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio personally contacted these allies. The key message emphasized that the strikes were solely Israel's operation, not involving U.S. assets, and that the U.S. favored diplomacy over military action.  This preemptive notification aimed to distance the U.S. from potential repercussions, particularly concerning allies hosting U.S. forces.</p>

          <p>Approximately 60 protesters, primarily veterans and military families, were arrested near the U.S. Capitol.

The arrests occurred on the eve of the Army's 250th-anniversary parade in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reviewing the Aukus security pact between the U.S., Australia, and the U.K., raising questions about its future.  The review aims to assess the agreement's alignment with the Trump administration's "America First" agenda.  Analysts suggest the U.S. is unlikely to abandon the pact entirely, given its importance in countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.  The review signals a potential shift in U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy.</p>
