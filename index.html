          <p>A new House Republican tax bill, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans while negatively impacting low-income households. The bill includes tax cuts for business owners, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas, but offsets these cuts with reductions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bottom 10% of households would see a 2% income decrease in 2027 and a 4% decrease in 2033, while the top 10% would see a 4% income boost in 2027 and a 2% boost in 2033. The bill now heads to the Senate for further consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in women with dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound scans. The New York Times article notes that this method is also capable of finding smaller tumors than regular mammography, although MRI scans detect more tumors overall but are more expensive. The study suggests contrast-enhanced mammography should become standard care for high-risk women with dense breasts, though it is not yet FDA-approved for screening. The research involved over 9,000 women and found that contrast-enhanced mammography detected 19.2 cancers per 1,000 exams.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has stated that Palestinians in Gaza are enduring the "cruelest phase" of the conflict, with Israel permitting only a "teaspoon of aid" when substantial assistance is required. Guterres has warned of potential famine and significant death and destruction, noting that 80% of Gaza is either militarized or under evacuation orders. Despite a recent easing of Israel's blockade, Guterres asserts that the resumed aid is inadequate to address the urgent needs of the population.</p>

          <p>An expert in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations expresses deep pessimism, stating that the conflict is driven by intense hatreds that are becoming increasingly murderous. The article argues that this "biblical rage" prevents both sides from acknowledging the validity of opposing viewpoints, citing the outrage over Israel's blockade of Gaza and the deadly assault on the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC as examples. The author emphasizes the need for careful navigation of this complex terrain, recognizing that anti-Zionism is not always antisemitic, but it can be, and that people can be easily stirred to violence.</p>

The choice of Kermit as a commencement speaker was met with mixed reactions, with some questioning whether it was an effort to sidestep difficult issues facing higher education. The speech included wisdom from a muppet's life, with Kermit sharing life with the right people, even a spotlight-hogging pig.</p>

          <p>President Trump has faced a series of court losses recently, with federal judges ruling against his administration on various matters. However, while the rulings indicate unlawful actions, the real-world consequences vary, and unwinding these actions can be challenging due to the slow pace of litigation. Despite the court losses, the Trump administration has responded with criticism and intends to appeal the decisions.

The bill includes extensions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, tax cuts on tips and overtime, and deductions for auto loan interest on U.S.-assembled cars. It also introduces Medicaid restrictions, increases the State and Local Tax Deduction cap, provides funding for border security, establishes "Trump accounts" for child savings, and restricts food stamps.

This division has led to a standstill in city planning, with proposals for an open street and a pedestrian mall both facing opposition.

Many in the EU and other countries are skeptical of the U.S. administration's threats, believing they will back down as they did with China.
