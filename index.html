          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of poisoning relatives with a mushroom meal, testified that she unintentionally served the toxic meal and subsequently panicked. Prosecutors allege she intentionally used death cap mushrooms and lied to police. Patterson pleaded not guilty to three murder charges and one attempted murder charge related to a beef wellington lunch in July 2023, where three relatives died and one survived. She described strained relationships with her former in-laws and communication issues with her estranged husband, also recounting the traumatic birth of her first child and her decision to leave the hospital against medical advice. The article details Patterson's defense against prosecution claims and her explanation of events leading up to the tragic incident. Optimism regarding the trial's outcome is low given the severity of the charges.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election with 50.89% of the vote against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki's leadership. Nawrocki's win was lauded by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, while EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland. The president's role is influential in foreign policy and legislation, potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system.
