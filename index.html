However, Cramer cautioned that this trend doesn't guarantee the same explosive growth seen in the previous quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC report addresses common myths surrounding cooking oils, featuring insights from Professor Nita Forouhi of the University of Cambridge. The article debunks claims that vegetable and sunflower oils are unhealthy, explaining they are low in saturated fats and beneficial when replacing butter or lard. It also clarifies that modern margarines no longer contain harmful trans fats and discusses the appropriate uses for different oils based on their smoke points, recommending basic olive oil for shallow frying and vegetable oil for deep frying.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has praised team captain Martin Odegaard for his "phenomenal" creativity, particularly highlighted in the recent Champions League victory over Olympiacos. Arteta stated that he has given the 26-year-old midfielder "total freedom" to take risks and generate opportunities on the field, which is his natural strength. Odegaard, who recently returned from a shoulder injury, was instrumental in both goals during the match and played a key role in the team's recent comeback win against Newcastle.</p>

The criminals, who had been trying to extort a ransom, reportedly backtracked on their threats without receiving payment, telling the BBC they were "sorry for hurting kids." While the nursery chain has not paid, experts caution that hackers' claims of deleting stolen data are not always reliable.</p>

          <p>Eight months into his second term, President Trump's aggressive campaign against "sanctuary" cities and states that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement has yielded few tangible results. Despite lawsuits against over a dozen Democratic-led jurisdictions and threats of funding cuts, most legal challenges remain unresolved, and local leaders have largely maintained their policies. While the administration has surged deportation agents to these areas, federal courts have blocked attempts to withhold funds, and only one city has reportedly altered its policies in response to the pressure.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has indicated a significant shift in military strategy, moving beyond a sole focus on nuclear deterrence to include a major upgrade of the country's conventional armed forces. This new policy aims to modernize conventional weapons systems, innovate defense production, and integrate advanced technologies like AI and unmanned systems. This change in focus, likely influenced by the war in Ukraine, suggests Pyongyang is pursuing a more comprehensive military capability, potentially with Russian assistance, escalating the security threat in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to increase the time refugees must wait before they can apply for permanent settlement, extending the current five-year period. Additionally, the route that allowed refugees to automatically bring close family members to the UK will be permanently scrapped. The government stated these "fundamental changes" are intended to ensure that settlement is "earned by contributing to the country," aligning the rules for refugees more closely with those for legal migrants on work visas, who may face a 10-year path to settlement.</p>

          <p>Recent polling suggests that President Trump's support among Latino voters, a key demographic in his 2024 victory, is eroding, primarily due to economic concerns like high grocery and housing costs. A New York Times/Sienna poll found 69% of Hispanic respondents disapprove of his job performance, and a majority believe he has worsened the economy. However, this decline in support for Trump has not translated into significant gains for the Democratic party, indicating that many Latino voters remain unconvinced by either side's economic message.</p>

          <p>The Democratic party has taken a considerable political gamble by initiating a government shutdown over a stalemate on healthcare tax credits, a move that comes when the party's approval ratings are low. While Democratic leaders like Senator Adam Schiff argue the fight is necessary to prevent millions from facing massive health insurance premium increases, the strategy is fraught with peril. The Trump administration is already responding with punitive measures, such as canceling billions in funding for projects in Democratic-led states, framing the shutdown as a result of Democratic obstruction.</p>

This reflects a strategic shift towards recruiting talent with established online followings, aiming to connect with younger audiences familiar with short-form digital comedy.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The President and the Dragon," chronicles former President Jimmy Carter's determined, multi-decade effort to eradicate Guinea worm disease. When Carter began his mission in 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases across Asia and Africa; by 2024, that number had been reduced to just 14. The film highlights how this remarkable public health achievement was accomplished not with vaccines, but through education, clean water initiatives, and the tireless work of local volunteers on the ground, fulfilling Carter's post-presidential legacy.</p>

          <p>On the first day of the government shutdown, the Trump administration announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in climate-related funding designated for 16 primarily Democratic-controlled states. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought characterized the funds as part of a "Green New Scam" meant to "fuel the Left's climate agenda." This action follows an earlier announcement freezing $18 billion for infrastructure projects in New York City, indicating the administration is using the shutdown to target political opponents and their policy priorities.</p>
