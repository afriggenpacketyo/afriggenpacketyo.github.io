        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A zookeeper was tragically killed by lions at Safari World Bangkok, raising serious questions about safety protocols and the park's controversial lion ownership practices. The incident, witnessed by a park visitor, involved six or seven of the big cats after the supervisor, with over 30 years' experience, stepped out of his car. This event has prompted an urgent investigation by Safari World to enhance safety measures and renewed calls from animal rights groups like PETA for the lions' relocation to a sanctuary. The tragedy underscores the inherent dangers of working closely with wild animals, even those raised in captivity, and the critical need for stringent safety adherence.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump dined in Washington D.C., promoting his initiative to deploy the National Guard and federalize police to combat crime, which he claimed made the city a "safe zone." He was met by both cheers and protests, with some diners chanting "Free Palestine" and "Trump is the Hitler of our time." Secret Service removed the protesters. The outing occurred amidst reports of declining restaurant reservations and frequent street protests against his federal crackdown, which has led to nearly 2,200 arrests since early August.</p>

          <p>As of September 9, 2025, average mortgage rates are 5.76% for 15-year and 6.58% for 30-year loans, while refinance rates stand at 6.01% for 15-year and 6.73% for 30-year terms. Experts suggest rates might stabilize if the Fed pauses hikes, but a strong credit profile and comparing lenders remain crucial for securing favorable terms. Borrowers should also consider loan terms and fees to ensure affordability and lock in rates after making a decision. This article provides a snapshot of the current market and advice for securing good rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale prices, measured by the Producer Price Index, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, providing a potential opening for the Federal Reserve to approve an interest rate cut this month. This decline, driven largely by a drop in services prices, defied expectations for a rise and comes amidst a weakening labor market. While inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, officials are increasingly confident in easing price pressures, despite concerns raised by President Trump's tariffs and his public pressure on the Fed. This article suggests a significant shift in the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock soared 28% after analysts expressed shock and praise for its massive growth projections in cloud infrastructure and new AI deals. Despite an earnings and revenue miss, Wall Street focused on the company's forecast of cloud revenue jumping to $18 billion this fiscal year and reaching $144 billion in five years, driven by multibillion-dollar contracts including one with OpenAI. This article highlights the "seismic shift" in computing and Oracle's unique approach to data center property, though some analysts caution that much of the growth comes from competitors offloading capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners can find affordable borrowing options through home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), with average rates around 8.10% to 8.37% as of September 9, 2025. These rates are significantly lower than other personal borrowing options and are expected to decline further with potential Fed rate cuts. Home equity loans offer fixed rates and lump sums, while HELOCs provide revolving credit with variable rates. Both can offer tax benefits for home improvements, but homeowners must carefully consider their budget and the risk of using their home as collateral.</p>

The diplomat's past relationship with Epstein, including a letter calling him "my best pal," has drawn criticism and raised questions about judgment, particularly given his current high-profile role.

Instead of a superpower, Russia is becoming China's disgruntled junior partner, reliant on its imports and financing. The piece suggests that the Kremlin's focus on destruction in Ukraine is causing it to miss the 21st-century technological revolution, leading to a "fortress economy" fortified against the future.</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university" under the proposed name London and South East University Group. This consolidation, driven by economic challenges facing the higher education sector, will result in a single institution with nearly 50,000 students across existing campuses. While officials insist it's not a takeover or crisis-driven, the University and College Union anticipates redundancies. The move, welcomed by England's higher education regulator, aims to provide a strong financial foundation and may inspire similar collaborations across the sector.</p>

          <p>A severe global education crisis is unfolding, with over 270 million children, including a quarter of teenagers, currently not enrolled in school—an increase of 21 million from the previous year. This alarming trend is exacerbated by ongoing conflicts in regions like Sudan, Gaza, and Afghanistan, and a projected $3.2 billion decline in international aid for education by 2026. The article emphasizes that school provides crucial stability and meals for children in crisis, with efforts like underground classrooms in Ukraine and makeshift schools in Gaza continuing despite immense challenges. The long-term economic cost of these education gaps is projected to be immense.</p>

This surge reflects weakening labor market data that pushed Treasury yields lower, making borrowing more attractive.

          <p>Scientists at New Hampshire's Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest have spent 57 years mapping songbird territories to understand how the forest ecosystem is changing. Behavioral ecologist Miranda Zammarelli, digitizing decades of hand-drawn maps, found that shifts in bird populations, like the disappearance of the least flycatcher, reflect the forest's natural aging process since being clearcut in the 1920s. This long-term data provides unique insights into habitat quality and ecological shifts, revealing how avian communities respond to environmental succession. However, the project faces uncertainty due to budget cuts, highlighting the importance of sustained environmental research for future understanding.</p>
