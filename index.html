          <p>Justin Bieber publicly apologized to his wife, Hailey Bieber, for a comment he made years ago stating she would never be on the cover of Vogue. He admitted that he made the statement out of disrespect and a desire to "get even" during a fight. Justin expressed that he and Hailey have matured and realized that such behavior only prolongs intimacy and connection. Hailey, in her Vogue interview, addressed rumors about their marriage and the difficulties of navigating public scrutiny during her postpartum period, emphasizing the importance of shutting out negativity.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and individuals at high risk of severe disease. However, the agency will require vaccine manufacturers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials before approving the vaccines for broader use in healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. This decision comes as the FDA acknowledges the divided opinions on repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses and aims to gather more robust evidence for their benefit in lower-risk populations. The new rules reflect a shift towards risk-based recommendations, similar to those adopted in other developed countries.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed his chief spokesman to convene a panel to review the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The panel will focus on accountability for senior military officials. The decision to appoint his spokesman, Sean Parnell, to lead the inquiry is unusual, indicating skepticism that military leaders would hold each other accountable. The review's scope will not include decisions leading up to the withdrawal, such as the Trump administration's deal with the Taliban, nor will it examine the sudden collapse of the Afghan military.</p>

His character's entrance into the bar, greeted with a chorus of "Norm!", became a memorable running gag. Wendt reunited with some of the "Cheers" cast at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2024, celebrating the show's enduring legacy.</p>

The company has sought to downplay publishers’ concerns that A.I. will disrupt their businesses. Mr. Pichai said A.I.

European officials said the message they took from the call was that they should not expect the United States to join them any time soon in piling additional financial pressure onto Mr. Putin. For Mr. Trump, that is a reversal. The American president declined, both in public and in his call with the European leaders, to follow up on that threat. The conditions to end the war, Mr. Trump, “will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.”</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass pledged to make it easier for productions to shoot in Los Angeles. The mayor signed an executive directive to support local film and TV jobs — an action that she said will lower costs and streamline city processes for on-location filming, as well as increase access to legendary L.A. locations including Griffith Observatory, Central Library and the Port of Los Angeles. The move was cheered by representatives from the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and other union leaders. The changes ordered by the mayor are relatively modest, but industry veterans are hopeful that they will ease some of the burdens faced by productions and smooth logistical issues.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has finalized an interim order to temporarily cut the number of flights coming in and out of Newark Liberty international airport as the embattled transit hub has recently experienced widespread delays and cancellations due to air traffic control operations. Beginning on Tuesday, 20 May, Newark airport’s maximum hourly rate is now 28 arrivals and 28 departures, for a total of 56 hourly operations. That number of arrivals and departures will continue until construction of runway 4-left/22-right is complete, said the FAA in an announcement, which is slated to end on 15 June during the week “but will continue on Saturdays until the end of the year”. Outside the construction period, the airport will increase to 34 arrivals and departures until 25 October 2025.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to develop a missile defense system designed to detect, track and potentially intercept incoming missiles. He says his "Golden Dome" would cost $175 billion (€155 billion) and he wants it "fully operational before the end of my term." Trump has asked for an initial $25 billion for the program in a sweeping tax-cut bill currently being reviewed by Congress. Speaking alongside the US president, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said the system is aimed at protecting "the homeland from cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, drones, whether they're conventional or nuclear."</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected claims from Democratic lawmakers that Washington was retreating from its long-standing commitments to humanitarian assistance and human rights or that China could replace the US as a global aid leader. Rubio’s appearance at two congressional hearings Tuesday follows growing concern that drastic cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are undermining decades of US soft power and giving China a huge global propaganda win, arguments the top US diplomat sought to counter. “China doesn’t do humanitarian aid. China does predatory lending – that’s what Belt and Road Initiative is,” Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a morning hearing, referring to Beijing’s sweeping infrastructure plan that has spent more than US$1 trillion globally since 2013.</p>

          <p>George Wendt, who earned six consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his role as the bearish, beer-quaffing Everyman Norm Peterson on the enduring sitcom “Cheers,” died on Tuesday morning at home in Studio City, Calif. He was 76. Over more than four decades, Mr. Wendt racked up about 170 film and television credits. But he was best known for “Cheers.” He appeared on every episode of the sitcom during its 11-year run on NBC, which began in 1982. His streak of Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series began in 1984.</p>

          <p>Banu Mushtaq’s “Heart Lamp,” translated by Deepa Bhasthi, had received little notice in Britain or the United States before Tuesday. Now, it’s won the major award for translated fiction.

Max Porter, an author and the chair of this year’s judges, said in a news conference that “Heart Lamp” contained “extraordinary accounts of patriarchal systems and resistance,” while the way Bhasthi had translated the collection was unique.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with two counts of assault after a confrontation with officers outside an immigration detention centre. Alina Habba - the interim US attorney for the state and a former personal attorney to President Donald Trump - initially announced the charges in a social media post late on Monday. The formal complaint, unsealed on Tuesday, alleges that McIver pushed Ice agents with her forearms and joined in efforts to prevent them from arresting Mayor Baraka. The eight-page document includes several screenshots from cameras worn by Ice officers that show McIver, in a bright red jacket, inside a crowd of politicians and law enforcement.</p>

The report found that 53.2 per cent of China’s investments in high-income economies flowed into Europe, with the EU and Britain accounting for 19.1 per cent of all foreign direct investment from the country – the first meaningful hike since 2018.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te's administration faces increasing political stalemates both at home and abroad. Even Washington – its closest supporter and biggest arms supplier – is willing to strike deals with Beijing that leave Taipei on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Lai’s efforts to strengthen Taiwan’s military readiness and ramp up defence spending to please Washington have met a lukewarm response from the White House, and the island’s youth are less and less inclined to join the armed forces. Worse still, Lai is faced with an opposition-controlled legislature that has blocked some of his key initiatives and called him a “dictator” – a label that has increasingly taken hold in public discussion.</p>

          <p>Some teenagers began using nicotine pouches to help them get off vapes – but says it just led to another addiction. Most pouches contain six to 20 milligrams (mg) of nicotine, while some contain 50mg - about five times stronger than an average cigarette. The pouches are often referred to as snus, although that is a different product which contains tobacco and has been banned in the UK and EU since 1992. The general use of nicotine pouches remains low in Great Britain. Research suggests that about 5% of adults and 3% of under-18s have tried them – but use appears to be increasing and is higher in some groups, particularly young men.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House. In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms. Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier. A Biden aide said the former president's prior medical check for prostate cancer was more than a decade ago. He had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test in 2014, the aide told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
