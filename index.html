          <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' reversal on winter fuel payments, after restoring the payment to more than three-quarters of pensioners, with some papers criticizing the initial decision as misguided and demanding an apology. The papers also highlight Labour's pledge to invest £14bn in the Sizewell C nuclear plant to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create 10,000 jobs, with the Energy Secretary touting a new "golden age" for British nuclear industry. Other headlines include Greta Thunberg's detention by Israeli authorities and a new NHS cancer treatment using sound waves. The newspapers each offer a slightly different angle on these stories, reflecting diverse political perspectives and priorities.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about the UK's stance on Israel's actions in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff had questioned the UK's arms sales and alleged disregard for international law by Israel. Senior civil servants responded by emphasizing the importance of delivering government policies wholeheartedly, with resignation being an "honourable course" for those with deep disagreements. The response has sparked outrage and disappointment among officials who feel the space for challenging policy is being shut down.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in world fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key factors.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 plummeting from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year, according to provisional CDC data. This shift is attributed to factors including wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and a possible shift in drug use among teens and young adults. While the improvement is dramatic, experts caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, as many still struggle with addiction and face potential cuts to addiction services.</p>
