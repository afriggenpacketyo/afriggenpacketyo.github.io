          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have reached a $96 billion agreement with Qatar Airways to sell up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and 787 order, according to the White House. The deal, involving 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, was formalized during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates the agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs during production and delivery. This agreement could provide a significant boost for Boeing, which has faced financial challenges in recent years. </p>

          <p>A recent executive order by President Trump aims to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. by tying them to prices in other countries. The U.S. consistently pays more for prescription drugs compared to other high-income countries, largely due to its complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. While branded drugs are more expensive in the U.S., unbranded generic drugs are often cheaper.

          <p>Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under President Biden, suggested that Biden's decision to run for a second term might have been a mistake. When asked if the Democratic party would have been better off without Biden as the nominee, Buttigieg responded, "Maybe, you know, right now, with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that is the case." Buttigieg's comments come amid speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run. He emphasized the need for the Democratic party to "meet people where they are."</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria has sparked hope for economic recovery in the war-torn country. Lifting sanctions is seen as crucial for rebuilding Syria's economy, which has been devastated by a decade of civil war.
