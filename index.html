          <p>Veteran actor Brian Cox is starring in a new play, "Make it Happen," which chronicles the rise and fall of the Royal Bank of Scotland, as part of the Edinburgh International Festival. Cox portrays the ghost of economist Adam Smith in the production, which is described as a biting satire on the financial crisis. At 79, Cox expresses a commitment to protest and social justice, drawing from his own difficult upbringing in Dundee. The article highlights how the play re-examines Smith's legacy, suggesting his work was more focused on moral philosophy and human welfare than pure capitalism, a theme that resonates with Cox's personal convictions.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil announced its second-quarter financial results, revealing a significant 23% drop in net income to $7.1 billion compared to the previous year. Despite the decline, the company's performance exceeded Wall Street predictions, with earnings per share at $1.64 against an expected $1.54. The better-than-expected results were attributed to strong production growth, which helped offset the negative impact of lower global oil prices. The company's revenue for the quarter also slightly beat estimates, coming in at $81.5 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>

          <p>The article details how retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada on US goods are leading to higher prices for consumers. It breaks down the impact on specific categories, including appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, which have seen modest price increases. The automotive sector is also significantly affected due to integrated supply chains, resulting in higher costs for both new and used cars, while grocery staples like peanut butter and canned soups are also becoming more expensive. The piece explains that these price hikes are a direct consequence of the ongoing trade dispute, affecting everyday household budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is facing the suspension of significant federal research funding from agencies like the NSF and NIH due to claims of antisemitism and bias on campus. UCLA's chancellor stated that hundreds of grants could be lost, impacting life-saving research and the work of faculty and staff. This development follows a recent $6 million settlement with Jewish students who alleged that pro-Palestinian demonstrations had obstructed their access to campus. The university administration expressed deep disappointment, arguing the penalty does not effectively address discrimination and is evaluating its next steps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a significant 44% decline in its second-quarter net income, which fell to $2.49 billion, largely due to lower oil prices and a financial loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The acquisition of Hess, which adds key assets in Guyana and the U.S., is expected to contribute to earnings later in the year. Chevron's worldwide production saw a 3% increase, with a notable 8% jump in U.S. output, driven by strong performance in the Permian Basin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has confirmed its new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin on October 12, replacing traditional passport stamping with biometric checks for non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. Under the new rules, travelers will need to have their fingerprints and faces scanned upon entry, with the data being valid for three years. While the system aims to tighten security and eventually speed up border crossings, the UK government has warned of potential initial delays. The rollout will be phased over six months, and the EU has assured that once registered, travelers can use e-gates where available, streamlining future trips.</p>

          <p>A woman whose 79-year-old mother died in a car crash in Cornwall is advocating for an overhaul of the UK's regulations for older drivers, calling the current system "unsafe and inadequate." Her mother, Geraldine Gibson, was killed after pulling into oncoming traffic, and her daughter believes age-related health issues were a factor. The article explores the broader debate, noting that while drivers must self-declare medical conditions to the DVLA, very few notifications come from medical professionals. With an aging population, the number of older drivers is increasing, prompting calls for mandatory testing and more formal reporting protocols to improve road safety.</p>

          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having an emergency savings fund acts as a crucial "security blanket" that protects long-term retirement savings. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take out loans or make hardship withdrawals from their retirement accounts. This is particularly important for hourly workers with volatile incomes, who are more prone to tapping their 401(k)s early. Financial experts recommend building a fund to cover three to six months of expenses and automating contributions to ensure consistent saving. (not investment advice)</p>

Rising temperatures are melting the snow and ice that act as a natural adhesive on mountains, leading to a higher frequency of rockfalls and avalanches. This has made popular climbing destinations in the Karakoram and Himalayas more dangerous, forcing expeditions to alter schedules and climb at night to avoid daytime heat. The piece also notes that extreme weather events, like glacial lake outburst floods, are becoming more common, threatening both climbers and local communities dependent on mountain tourism.</p>

Wind gusts could reach 60 to 80 mph in northern coastal and hilly regions, and up to 45 mph in southern inland areas.

          <p>This article defines and explores parasocial relationships, the one-sided connections people form with public figures like celebrities, influencers, and podcasters. It explains that while these relationships feel real, they are not reciprocal, an illusion facilitated by modern media's intimate style and the constant access to celebrities' lives. The piece traces the history of intense fandom and notes that while often harmless, these dynamics can become toxic when fans overstep boundaries, leading to harassment and a sense of entitlement. It concludes by advising fans to remain mindful of the distinction between a public persona and a real person to engage with media responsibly.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the decline of Intel, once the most valuable U.S. chipmaker, and its struggle to compete with rivals like Nvidia, which has soared in value due to the AI boom. A series of strategic missteps, including passing on the opportunity to supply chips for the first iPhone, and significant manufacturing delays allowed competitors to gain market share. Despite a costly turnaround plan under a previous CEO, Intel's foundry business has reported substantial losses. The new chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, is now focused on cutting costs and re-evaluating investments to steer the historic Silicon Valley company back toward profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris's recent announcement that she will not run for governor of California has fueled speculation that she is preparing for a 2028 presidential bid. This article explores the challenges a female candidate, particularly Harris, might face in a post-Trump political landscape. It discusses whether Democrats might perceive a female candidate as a risk, given lingering sexism and the party's search for a clear identity. While some experts believe a candidate's economic platform will be more crucial than their gender, others argue that a woman of color could authentically speak to the need for change and mobilize key voter demographics.</p>

          <p>The community of Sierra Madre, California, has experienced a sharp increase in home break-ins by black bears, a situation officials believe has been worsened by the recent Eaton fire charring their natural habitat. In response to dozens of incidents, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife trapped and euthanized a 300-pound female bear believed to be the primary culprit. However, local officials and residents remain concerned, citing a lack of state resources for managing human-wildlife conflicts. The ongoing issue has sparked debate between those calling for more forceful intervention and those urging residents to better secure trash and other attractants.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Democratic Party and progressive culture are alienating male voters by portraying masculinity in a consistently negative light, potentially driving them to support Donald Trump. Citing recent focus groups and a pattern of critical media commentary, the author suggests that many men feel overlooked and criticized by the left. The article contends that this creates a "siege mentality" that makes them receptive to Trump's messaging as an act of rebellion. The author advises Democrats to change their tone, engage with men's concerns, and offer policies that don't seem to originate from a "gender studies seminar" to win back their support.</p>

Medical societies emphasize that robust data shows most SSRIs are safe and do not increase the risk of birth defects, and that untreated maternal depression carries significant health risks for both mother and child.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order imposing a new system of tariffs on nearly 70 countries, with rates ranging from 10% to 41%. The duties, which are set to take effect next week, target countries based largely on their trade deficits with the U.S. and follow through on the president's previous threats of reciprocal tariffs. Some countries, like Vietnam and Japan, will see lower rates than initially proposed due to recently negotiated trade deals, while Mexico has received a 90-day delay. The tariffs are expected to cost the average U.S. household an additional $2,400 this year. (not investment advice)</p>
