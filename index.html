          <p>OpenAI has launched GPT-5, its most advanced AI model, making it accessible to all ChatGPT users, including those on the free tier. The company states the new model is significantly faster, more accurate, and less prone to fabricating answers, a phenomenon known as hallucination. New capabilities include "vibe coding," where users can generate software from simple text prompts, and "safe completions" for handling potentially risky queries. The rollout aims to reach an estimated 700 million weekly active users and is being integrated into partner products like Microsoft 365 Copilot.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a historic peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the White House. The deal, attended by both nations' leaders, aims to resolve decades of conflict and includes Armenian development rights for a new transit corridor named the "Trump Route." U.S. officials have worked for months on the pact, which is seen as a crucial step for deepening regional ties and potentially expanding the Abraham Accords. The agreement will also open new energy and trade routes to the West that bypass both Russia and Iran.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining migrants who crossed the English Channel under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme with France. According to a government source, several dozen individuals have been detained and could be returned to France within weeks. The 11-month program involves the UK accepting an equal number of vetted asylum seekers from France in exchange for those who arrive illegally by small boat. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is prepared to defend against legal challenges to the removals, emphasizing that France is a safe country.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating an incident in a St. Louis suburb as a "horrific antisemitic attack" after three vehicles were set on fire outside the home of an American citizen who had served in the Israel Defense Forces. The words "DEATH TO THE IDF" were also spray-painted in the driveway, leading officials to treat the event as a hate crime. The Department of Justice's antisemitism task force has vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, with officials condemning the violence. The article notes that while overall hate crimes have slightly decreased, anti-Jewish hate crimes have reached a new high according to recent data.</p>

          <p>President Trump's implementation of widespread "reciprocal" tariffs has introduced significant volatility and uncertainty into the global economy, making investing more complex. Market strategists suggest that while long-term investors may benefit from staying the course, there are also tactical opportunities for those willing to look. Sectors like utilities and financials, which are more service-oriented and U.S.-based, are seen as less exposed to tariff impacts than industrials or consumer discretionary goods. The article also notes that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on areas like cryptocurrency and nuclear energy have performed well, as they are not directly affected by tariffs on physical goods.

          <p>In response to President Trump's directive to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census, this article explains the constitutional and operational realities of the decennial count. The Constitution requires an "actual enumeration" of all persons every ten years to determine congressional representation, a process that cannot be changed quickly. While the Trump administration's previous attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court, a new effort has a longer legal runway before the 2030 count. The article clarifies that the census is a massive, multi-year undertaking and that its data is fundamental to reapportioning congressional seats and redrawing districts nationwide.</p>

Leaders in affected countries like Brazil, Switzerland, and Laos are scrambling to implement contingency plans, with some describing the duties as "unacceptable blackmail" and a "horror scenario."

In contrast, Trump's public dismissal of the commissioner over a jobs report he deemed a "scam" demonstrates a more direct and unconstrained willingness to abuse presidential authority, making him the first president to ever take such an action.</p>

          <h2>ETFs Offer a Path for Long-Term Crypto Investing Amid New 401(k) Rules</h2>

          <p>Following President Trump's executive order to allow cryptocurrencies in 401(k)s, this article explores how investors can gain exposure to the asset class, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Crypto ETFs, which have seen record inflows this year, offer a convenient way to invest without directly holding digital currencies. The piece distinguishes between standard ETFs like BlackRock's IBIT, which track the token's price, and more aggressive leveraged funds designed for short-term trading. While some advisors advocate for significant crypto allocation in portfolios, others caution that the risks associated with volatility remain a major concern for long-term retirement planning.

          <p>Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren are demanding internal documents from UnitedHealth Group regarding a program that provides bonuses to nursing homes for reducing hospital transfers. The inquiry follows a Guardian investigation and whistleblower complaints suggesting the healthcare giant may be prioritizing profits over the health of elderly residents. The senators expressed concern that the bonus metric, which caps all hospitalizations regardless of necessity, could be a poor measure of care quality. UnitedHealth defends the program, stating it aims to curb unnecessary hospitalizations and that it has received high satisfaction ratings from patients.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, has sent a letter to Google and YouTube inquiring about settlement discussions with President Trump's legal team. The senators are concerned about a potential "quid-pro-quo" arrangement where Google might settle Trump's censorship lawsuit in exchange for favorable treatment from the administration on other legal matters. The letter highlights that Google is currently a defendant in major government antitrust and labor lawsuits. It points to a recent court filing indicating "productive discussions" between the parties, raising questions about the motivations behind a potential settlement.</p>

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threat to impose 100% "secondary tariffs" on countries that purchase Russian energy exports if a ceasefire in Ukraine is not reached. After Trump targeted India with a lower-than-threatened 25% tariff, oil prices actually declined, suggesting traders believe the president is bluffing or that a deal will be reached. Analysts note that steep tariffs would disrupt global supply and cause prices to soar, undermining Trump's goal of lowering energy costs. The market's muted reaction indicates a belief that the administration will avoid actions that could trigger a significant price spike at the pump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast, slightly lowering its storm prediction but still anticipating above-normal activity. The new outlook projects 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine becoming hurricanes and two to five of those strengthening into major hurricanes. This is a slight decrease from the May forecast but remains above the 30-year average of 14 named storms. Forecasters cite factors like neutral El Niño conditions and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures as drivers for the active season, urging communities in storm-prone areas to remain prepared.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of being "highly conflicted" due to alleged business ties with China. The unusual demand follows scrutiny from Republican Senator Tom Cotton over Tan's past investments in Chinese companies, some reportedly linked to the Chinese military. Intel, a major recipient of U.S. government funds for domestic chip manufacturing, has defended Tan, stating his commitment to U.S. national security. The president's attack caused Intel's shares to fall and highlights the administration's increasing pressure on tech companies regarding their operations in China.</p>

In a social media post, he stated the new count would be based on "modern day facts and figures" and information from the 2024 presidential election. This move represents a significant escalation of his previous efforts to alter the decennial survey, which is constitutionally mandated to count all persons for apportioning congressional seats.

The author contends that while agencies like the BLS and Congressional Budget Office have flaws and deserve criticism, firing the BLS commissioner over an inconvenient jobs report undermines the credibility of the data essential for a modern economy. The article suggests that instead of political retaliation, the administration should pursue genuine reform to improve data accuracy. Restoring confidence in these institutions is presented as a necessary step to achieving a vision of American economic dynamism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay argues that the decline of politeness, exacerbated by anonymous online interactions and communication with AI, is detrimental to personal well-being. The author defines politeness as a key component of personality and notes that being rude, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, can increase one's own anger and depression. Conversely, practicing courtesy, even when it feels undeserved, is shown to elevate mood and happiness. The author suggests making politeness a conscious habit, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity as practical ways to improve personal happiness and counteract a broader cultural trend toward incivility.</p>
