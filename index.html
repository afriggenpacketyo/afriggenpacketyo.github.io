          <p>A second unvaccinated child in West Texas has died from measles-related complications as the outbreak continues to spread, with nearly 570 cases reported across multiple states and Mexico. The outbreak, which began over two months ago, has prompted the CDC to send a team to assist with the response. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s tepid stance on vaccinations has drawn criticism amidst the outbreak, with experts warning that the U.S. could lose its measles elimination status. The vast majority of cases are among unvaccinated individuals and children under 17, raising concerns about the ongoing impact of vaccine hesitancy.</p>

          <p>Veterans in Wyoming hold differing views on President Trump's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), with some supporting the changes as a way to streamline the agency and reduce costs, while others fear the cuts will negatively impact access to vital services. Many veterans express a desire for reforms within the VA, including less bureaucracy and more input from veterans in policy decisions. Concerns are raised about potential privatization of VA services, which could compromise care, and the broader economic impact on the region, where the veteran suicide rate is already high.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariff regime, triggered by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, faces significant implementation challenges. The policy aims to correct global imbalances, restore manufacturing, and confront non-market economies, but lacks a coherent implementation plan. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), already understaffed and underfunded, will struggle to enforce variable tariffs across trading partners, potentially leading to bureaucratic bottlenecks and economic distortions. The absence of a formal rulemaking process and public comment period further exacerbates the challenges, raising concerns about the policy's long-term effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Homebuilders are facing a surge in unsold homes, reaching levels not seen since the Great Recession, prompting them to offer incentives to attract buyers. These incentives include mortgage rate buydowns, closing cost credits, and funds for upgrades, with some builders even slashing prices. The growing inventory reflects a shift in the market, as builders who rushed to meet pandemic-driven demand now contend with higher mortgage rates and affordability challenges. While this creates opportunities for buyers, the trend may not last as builders slow down construction to clear their backlog.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging over 2,200 points and the Nasdaq Composite entering a bear market, driven by concerns over the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the potential for a global trade war. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the tariffs are likely to increase inflation and slow economic growth. The market downturn erased trillions of dollars in investor wealth, prompting economists to downgrade their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones stated that the era of globalization has "ended" following Donald Trump's imposition of new tariffs, prompting the UK government to consider intervention to protect domestic firms. The UK was among nations hit with a 10% import duty, and negotiations for a trade deal to reduce tariffs are ongoing. The government is exploring ways to invest in the UK's economy and build relationships with allies, while the Liberal Democrats are calling for parliamentary oversight of any trade deal with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Construction is underway on the Wallis Annenberg wildlife crossing in Los Angeles, the world's largest wildlife bridge, aimed at reconnecting fragmented habitats and saving wildlife from traffic fatalities. The project, a public-private partnership, will create a native wildlife habitat above the 101 freeway, connecting two parts of the Santa Monica mountain range. The crossing will feature engineered soil, native plants, and sound walls to facilitate safe passage for animals, including mountain lions, frogs, and insects. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration ramps up deportations, immigrants with pending cases or parole are increasingly fearful of routine check-ins with ICE, which have become more likely to result in arrest and detention. Lawyers are advising clients to prepare for potential detention, even though skipping check-ins would violate immigration regulations. ICE's broadened mandate now prioritizes all immigrants without legal status for arrest, regardless of their compliance with authorities or lack of criminal history. The situation has created widespread anxiety and uncertainty within immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department is seeking the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the killing as a "premeditated, cold-blooded assassination." The decision has intensified the cultural significance of the case, given widespread public animosity toward the for-profit healthcare industry. Legal experts suggest Mangione's defense team may shift focus from guilt or innocence to mitigating factors in an effort to avoid the death penalty.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that over half of millennials are engaged in "polyworking," holding multiple jobs to supplement their income, driven by factors such as inflation and stagnant wages. Many millennials are pursuing personal interests, saving for the future, and gaining skills for career advancement through these additional income streams. While critics express concerns about the long-term effects on work-life balance, polyworking is increasingly viewed as a form of entrepreneurship and a hedge against economic uncertainty in a changing workplace landscape.</p>

          <p>Chinese-sponsored upgrades to Cambodia's Ream Naval Base are part of Beijing's strategic effort to diversify regional maritime access and de-risk supply chains, according to a Hong Kong-based analyst. The upgrades include a joint logistics and training center and a pier capable of handling large warships. While China's defense ministry claims the facility is for regional counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance, the US has expressed concerns about potential exclusive PLA access to the site. The move reflects China's broader Belt and Road Initiative and its efforts to secure its maritime interests.</p>
