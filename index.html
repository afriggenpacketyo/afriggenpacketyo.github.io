        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent surveys suggest the United States is becoming a less attractive destination for many Asian travelers, particularly those from Southeast Asia. Concerns over potential discrimination, gun violence, and administration policies are cited as more significant deterrents than cost. While overall interest has waned, travelers from countries with large U.S. diasporas, like Vietnam and the Philippines, show increased interest, potentially due to family connections and the influence of American culture. The data reflects a complex and varied sentiment across different Asian nations regarding travel to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1. The announcement, made via a letter to Canada's prime minister, cites Ottawa's retaliatory tariffs and links the new duties to stopping the flow of fentanyl from Canada. The letter also warns that the tariff rate could increase if Canada chooses to retaliate further. This move escalates trade tensions as it is separate from existing sectoral tariffs already impacting the Canadian economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Russia intensifies its missile and drone strikes on Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. senators to discuss strengthening his country's air defense capabilities. The meeting focused on acquiring more defense systems, potential joint weapons production, and a bipartisan U.S. bill proposing heavy tariffs on countries still purchasing Russian energy. Meanwhile, President Trump indicated he would make a "major statement" on Russia, expressing frustration with Vladimir Putin. The diplomatic and military activities occur as Ukraine secures over €10 billion in recovery pledges at a conference in Rome.</p>

The incident occurred in a new seven-mile-long wastewater tunnel, with the collapse happening far from the single access point. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department's Urban Search and Rescue teams facilitated the rescue, and remarkably, none of the workers sustained any visible injuries. The multi-million dollar construction project has been paused indefinitely while Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a temporary block on President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of some non-citizens. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argues the order violates the 14th Amendment. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited the scope of nationwide injunctions, but the new lawsuit was structured to comply with the high court's standards. The White House has criticized the ruling, vowing to fight what it calls an attempt to impede the president's policies.</p>

The research suggests eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, together—act as "emotional shortcuts" that resonate across cultures and political affiliations. While not a guarantee of victory, these words serve as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging. The analysis also contrasts these universal words with more "bespoke" slogans like "Get Brexit Done," which are effective for single-issue campaigns but have less enduring appeal.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, where over 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were killed in a UN-designated "safe area." The author shares the story of a survivor and draws a parallel between the international community's historical inaction and the current suffering of civilians in Gaza. The piece questions the efficacy of the phrase "never again," which has been declared after numerous atrocities, including the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide. It calls for an end to the cycle of witnessing, inaction, and belated condemnation.</p>

          <p>Tesla has filed an application with the Arizona Department of Transportation to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The move would follow competitor Waymo, which has operated a driverless service in the region since 2020. This expansion effort comes after Tesla launched a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where human-supervised vehicles have encountered some issues, including a minor accident. The company is working to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, using a camera-based system it claims is more economically viable.</p>

          <p>With the UK experiencing its third heatwave of the year after a record-warm spring, this article examines whether the extreme weather is "just summer." It explains that human-influenced global warming has unequivocally raised the likelihood and intensity of such events, noting that a 1°C global rise can mean heatwaves are 3-4°C warmer locally. The piece debunks comparisons to the 1976 heatwave, showing that today's events are more frequent and geographically widespread. Climate projections indicate hot spells will become an increasingly common feature, particularly in southeastern England.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a surge in demand. The number of fertility treatments rose nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022, and one in six babies in Seoul last year was born with their help. Experts attribute this to a generational shift, with more people seeking to control their family planning timeline, often delaying childbirth due to financial and career pressures. While the government has expanded subsidies, patients still face high costs and workplace challenges, highlighting ongoing barriers to parenthood.</p>

          <p>A senior Israeli official has stated that Israel believes the deeply buried stockpiles of enriched uranium at an Iranian nuclear facility recently struck by the U.S. military could potentially be retrieved by Iran. This assessment adds a new dimension to the damage caused by the June strikes, which the Trump administration claimed had "obliterated" the sites. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency's initial report was more measured, and the agency that designed the "bunker buster" bombs used is still awaiting data to confirm their effectiveness.

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is lengthening at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. This means that even small increases in the planet's average temperature will have a disproportionately large impact on the length and severity of extreme heat events. The study, which analyzed global heat wave data, warns that the longest and rarest heat waves are changing the fastest. This acceleration poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, underscoring the urgent need for faster adaptation strategies.</p>

          <p>A new report from the United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) warns that significant progress in the global fight against HIV/AIDS is at risk due to sharp funding cuts, particularly from the United States.

UNAIDS estimates that without new funding, there could be six million new infections and four million additional deaths in the next four years.
