          <p>President Trump suggested that a "very strong form of testing" will be implemented for women's sports at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, implying mandatory gender verification. This follows a U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee policy amendment to align with Trump's executive order on "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." Women's sports advocates and some athletes have been calling for stricter sex screening protocols, such as karyotyping, to ensure fair competition. The discussion highlights the ongoing and contentious debate surrounding the participation of transgender athletes in female sports categories.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that Vice President JD Vance is the most probable heir apparent to lead the MAGA movement. During a press event, Trump stated that while it is early, Vance is doing a "great job" and would likely be the favored candidate for 2028. He also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio as another potential contender, suggesting they might team up. Both Vance and Rubio, once critics of Trump, have since become staunch allies, though they have remained publicly noncommittal about their future presidential ambitions.</p>

McDonald, who was a fugitive for a period, admitted to misrepresenting how investor funds would be used after his firm suffered massive losses from a risky market bet in late 2020. He misappropriated client money for personal expenses, including luxury car purchases and rent, and used new investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier clients. Prosecutors stated he caused over $3 million in losses to his victims. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Rwandan government has confirmed an agreement to receive up to 250 migrant deportees from the United States, joining South Sudan and Eswatini in accepting individuals under a Trump administration plan. Rwanda will have the ability to approve each individual and will provide them with workforce training, healthcare, and accommodation. This development follows a similar but ultimately failed deal between Rwanda and the UK, which was struck down by the British Supreme Court over safety concerns.

Committee Chair James Comer stated the move is necessary for congressional oversight of federal sex trafficking law enforcement. The committee also subpoenaed several high-profile figures for testimony, including former President Bill Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey. This action escalates a potential conflict with the Trump administration, which has faced pressure to increase transparency regarding the Epstein case amid public frustration.</p>

The move signals a more hands-on presidential role than is typical for U.S.-hosted Games, with Trump stating he would use the National Guard or military if necessary to ensure safety. The creation of the task force, co-led by Vice President JD Vance, aims to coordinate federal efforts on security and transportation. This direct involvement could create friction with Los Angeles city officials, who have previously clashed with Trump over his policies and use of military personnel.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to drop in after-hours trading. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, just below the 49 cents anticipated, though its revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed forecasts. The company's AI business revenue saw a year-over-year decline, partly due to U.S. export restrictions to China, which cost it an estimated $800 million in sales. Despite these challenges, AMD's data center and gaming segments showed strong growth, and the company provided a positive sales outlook for the current quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

His lawyer condemned the execution as a "brutal and unchecked abuse of government power" and an act of "pure, unbridled bloodlust and cowardice."</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired five of the eight members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, the body created by Congress to manage the U.S. territory's fiscal crisis. A White House official stated the board had been run "inefficiently and ineffectively" and that it was time for new leadership. The dismissed members include the chairman and four others, most of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents. The board, established under the PROMESA Act, has been overseeing Puerto Rico's path to solvency and its complex debt restructuring, a process that remains contentious and incomplete.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. metropolitan areas, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their peak prices in 2022, with declines of nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is largely driven by an increase in housing inventory in these regions, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience tight inventory and rising prices, with cities like Milwaukee seeing a 26% increase since 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

Three major fires are already active in Southern and Central California, including the state's largest of the year, the Gifford fire. While Northern California has had a quieter season so far, officials warn that vegetation is drying out, and the incoming heat will elevate the risk significantly.</p>

A former communist official, Iliescu rose to power during the violent 1989 revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, becoming the country's first democratically elected president. His legacy is deeply divisive; he is credited with steering Romania toward NATO and the EU but is also condemned for his role in the violent suppression of protests in the 1990s, known as the Mineriads. His presidency was marked by both democratic reforms and accusations that he failed to fully break from the country's authoritarian past and its culture of corruption.</p>

          <p>This article examines the term "Russia hoax," a phrase frequently used by Donald Trump to dismiss investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The author argues that despite Trump's claims, the core findings of Russian meddling are not in dispute, as confirmed by U.S. intelligence and a GOP-led Senate investigation. The meaning of the "hoax" has shifted over time, from allegations of illegal surveillance to a general "witch hunt," but has been effective in sowing doubt. The article contends that recent efforts by Trump allies to bolster the "hoax" narrative are themselves misleading and part of a continued effort to obscure the facts of the 2016 interference.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. This move will allow jurors to decide if formal charges should be filed against those who may have conspired to falsely link Donald Trump to Russia. The action follows recent allegations from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and the declassification of documents from the Durham inquiry. These documents suggest a plan by Hillary Clinton's campaign to smear Trump, though the authenticity of the evidence, potentially Russian forgeries, remains a key question in the highly politicized affair.</p>

Investigators found that CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, proceeded with dives despite warnings and likely damage to the vessel's hull.

This article explains that while gerrymandering has a long history in U.S. politics, its use as a powerful partisan weapon has escalated dramatically. With the Supreme Court ruling in 2019 that federal courts cannot block maps for being purely partisan, states have become the primary battlegrounds for these politically charged conflicts over representation.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of placing $10,000 into a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account. While a top high-yield savings account might currently offer a slightly higher rate and thus marginally more interest over three months, its rate is variable and could fall. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed rate, providing guaranteed returns but sacrificing liquidity, as early withdrawals incur penalties. With interest rate cuts potentially on the horizon, the guaranteed rate of a CD may be more advantageous, but the choice ultimately depends on an individual saver's financial goals and need for flexibility.
