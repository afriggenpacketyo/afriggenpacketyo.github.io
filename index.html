            <p>Malaysian durian growers are experiencing a significant increase in sales to China due to the rising popularity of fresh, naturally ripened durians. Improved logistics and a steady supply have enabled Malaysian suppliers to boost exports by 30% this year, according to fruit distributors. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen on the tree before being harvested, a factor that appeals to Chinese consumers. This growing demand presents substantial opportunities for Malaysian durian farmers to expand their market share in China.</p>
