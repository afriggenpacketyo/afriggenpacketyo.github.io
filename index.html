          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a deal to reset relations after Britain's exit from the bloc in 2020. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. Both sides will also work towards a "balanced youth experience" scheme, allowing young people to work, study, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time, and explore the UK's potential participation in the Erasmus+ education program. The article states that the agreement seeks to deepen ties, especially for the younger generation, and address challenges posed by irregular migration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reversing course on a policy that allowed states to use Medicaid funds for social services like housing and nutrition, arguing that these services should not be paid for by government health insurance. This reverses a trend where numerous states expanded Medicaid to cover such services, aiming to improve health outcomes and reduce costs associated with emergency care and chronic conditions. The administration's decision has caused confusion and concern among state leaders, who worry it will disrupt ongoing investments and lead to increased suffering and healthcare costs. Experts warn that this disinvestment will negatively impact vulnerable populations and increase overall healthcare spending.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Beijing may be less inclined to implement aggressive fiscal stimulus measures in the upcoming quarter, as recent macroeconomic data indicates China's economic resilience against US tariff pressures. Investment banks have revised their growth forecasts for China following a 90-day tariff truce with the United States and a supportive policy package from China's central bank. Despite a slight slowdown in April compared to the first quarter, China's industrial output and retail sales exceeded expectations, while exports grew despite the impact of US tariffs. This article suggests that China's economy is holding steady amidst international trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms and the discovery of a nodule on his prostate, and while the cancer is Stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris issued supportive statements, while prostate cancer experts noted that although the cancer is incurable once it has spread, advancements in treatment have significantly increased survival rates. The article also mentions the release of audio from Mr. Biden's 2023 interview with Robert K. Hur, which reveals Mr. Biden’s difficulty providing dates and details.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen argues that the United States needs to prioritize open-source AI to avoid ceding control to China. He believes AI will "intermediate" key institutions like education, law, and medicine, making control over AI models a matter of technological sovereignty. Andreessen emphasizes the importance of an American or Western open-source large language model to shape the values and messaging embedded in AI. His comments come amid increasing US-China tech rivalry and a debate over open- versus closed-source AI models.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit down to £1,720 from the current level of £1,849. The article clarifies that the price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, so total bills will vary based on usage.</p>

          <p>Drinks giant Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker, expects US trade tariffs to cost the company around 150 million US dollars annually and is launching a major cost-cutting plan. The company will be impacted by a 10% tariff on UK and European imports into the US, implemented by President Donald Trump. Diageo believes its current plans will mitigate around half of the impact of these higher costs on its profit and it will work on further measures to offset the impact. This reflects an improving outlook after Diageo previously braced for a 200 million US dollar hit to profits from tariffs.</p>
