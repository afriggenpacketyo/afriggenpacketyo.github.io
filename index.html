          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled costs, raising questions about the state's ability to complete large-scale infrastructure projects. An eminent-domain lawyer, Mark Wasser, disputes claims that property acquisition is the primary cause of the delays. He notes that design and construction often proceed during compensation negotiations. The project, initially intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is now projected to run only 171 miles between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033, with farmers and landowners expressing skepticism about its completion.</p>

          <p>Economists are exploring the potential of refitting underused single-family homes into multi-unit dwellings as a solution to America's affordable housing crisis. With zoning codes often restricting apartment buildings, developers are finding creative ways to add rental units to existing structures. This approach aims to address the housing mismatch, where older people live in large homes with empty bedrooms while others seek smaller, more affordable options. Cities and states are encouraging backyard homes and lot subdivisions to add housing without disrupting existing neighborhoods.</p>
