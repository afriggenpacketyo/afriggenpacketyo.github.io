          <p>This article explores Harry Kane's remarkable football career, highlighting his record-breaking goal tallies for England, Tottenham Hotspur, and Bayern Munich over more than a decade. Despite his consistent, prolific scoring and significant impact on team performance, some analysts suggest he remains underappreciated compared to other global stars. Pundits like Chris Sutton and Pat Nevin argue Kane's all-around playmaking ability, vision, and humility are often overlooked, even as he rapidly reaches new milestones for his club. His stellar contributions, particularly in major tournaments, solidify his status as one of England's greatest strikers, yet his understated public persona might contribute to this perceived undervaluation among some fans and media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly rushing to rehire Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff members who were mistakenly laid off as part of broader government shutdown cuts. These firings, affecting over 4,000 federal jobs, included critical experts working on measles, Ebola outbreaks, infectious disease surveillance, and the production of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Federal health officials indicated that many terminations were errors due to job code misclassification, with efforts underway to restore hundreds of these essential workers. This incident highlights concerns about the administration's approach to public health, following previous criticisms and staff changes at the CDC.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in Tel Aviv, expressing anticipation for the imminent release of Israeli hostages by Hamas under a newly brokered ceasefire deal. During the event, US special envoy Steve Witkoff received praise for Donald Trump's instrumental role in facilitating the agreement, though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced boos. Concurrently, Palestinian officials reported approximately 500,000 people returning to northern Gaza, which remains largely in ruins. An upcoming summit in Egypt, attended by multiple world leaders including Trump, aims to finalize the war-ending agreement, while Hamas mobilizes fighters in Gaza amid concerns of internal conflict.</p>

          <h2>Kenya Converts US Dollar Loans to Chinese Yuan, Reducing Debt Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 00:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenya has announced a significant financial move, converting its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans, originally from the Export-Import Bank of China, to Chinese yuan. This strategic shift is expected to reduce annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million, effectively halving the interest rates from 6.37 percent under the previous dollar-denominated agreement. With approximately US$3.5 billion of the loan remaining unpaid, this conversion offers substantial relief to Kenya's national budget. Analysts suggest this decision not only benefits Kenya but also potentially paves the way for other debt-stressed African countries to strengthen their financial ties with China, signaling a broader geopolitical shift.</p>

          <p>New revelations, including an alleged email from Prince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein stating "we are in this together," have intensified calls for royal sanctions against the Duke of York. This article details how these reports directly contradict Andrew's previous claims of cutting ties with Epstein in late 2010, further damaging his already tarnished reputation. King Charles faces growing pressure to distance the Royal Family from Andrew, with suggestions ranging from excluding him from Christmas gatherings to stripping him of his remaining titles. Despite past attempts to reduce his public role and funding, Andrew's independent financial resilience and existing lease on Royal Lodge present ongoing challenges to fully isolating him from royal life.</p>

          <p>In a significant upset, USC's football team secured a decisive 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan, largely fueled by the breakout performance of walk-on running back King Miller.

The Trojans' defense also showed marked improvement, stifling Michigan's potent offense and holding their freshman quarterback to just 207 yards. This resounding win, especially after a disappointing previous loss, marks a crucial turnaround for USC and coach Lincoln Riley, highlighting the team's resilience and unexpected talent.</p>

Beijing defended its recent export limits on rare earth minerals, crucial for tech production, citing military applications and the "current turbulent global situation."

          <p>Alison Davis was found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, whose death at the base of a steep stairway was initially deemed an accident but later investigated as a homicide. Prosecutors argued Kevin was beaten to death, citing multiple skull fractures, his cold body temperature suggesting a delayed 911 call, and Alison's alleged inconsistent statements and unnatural behavior. The defense, however, maintained it was an accidental fall, with their medical expert arguing a single impact with a banister post caused the extensive injuries. Despite admitted flaws in the initial police investigation, the jury ultimately sided with the defense's theory, leading to Alison's acquittal after 17 months in jail.</p>

This article highlights nine key concerns for the Dodgers, focusing on the Brewers' small-ball offense, which prioritizes getting on base, making contact, and stealing bases over relying on home runs. Milwaukee's formidable pitching staff, led by ace Freddy Peralta and the impactful rookie reliever Jacob Misiorowski, ranked second in team ERA this season, showcasing impressive depth.

He alleges a "failure of leadership" in the city's emergency response, citing broken hydrants and inadequate pre-deployment of firefighters. Beutner, a philanthropist and former investment banker, could pose a significant political threat to Bass, especially after a recent report criticized the fire department's operations and Bass's approval of city worker pay raises contributing to a budget shortfall.</p>

She won her first Oscar – an exceptionally rare win for a comic performance – and received three more nominations, leaving behind a celebrated legacy as a beloved and influential star who never married but adopted two children later in life.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's poor performance at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Philadelphia Phillies has raised significant concerns for the upcoming NL Championship Series (NLCS). Ohtani, a multi-time MVP winner, managed only one hit in 18 at-bats with nine strikeouts, primarily struggling against left-handed pitching. While manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the tough matchups, he emphasized that Ohtani needs to "recalibrate" his approach and improve his "at-bat quality," particularly regarding swing decisions and managing the strike zone. The article stresses the Dodgers' crucial reliance on Ohtani's offensive contributions, stating they "are not gonna win the World Series with that sort of performance."</p>

          <h2>Belgium Moves to Ban Kangaroo Meat Imports Citing Animal Welfare Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 20:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Belgium, the second-largest importer of kangaroo meat globally, intends to formally ban its trade and sale by July, citing severe animal welfare concerns. The Flemish government informed the European Parliament that the commercial hunting of kangaroos in Australia, described as "the largest slaughter of wild land animals in the world," involves "animal-unfriendly" practices. Key concerns highlighted include the inability of Australian authorities to properly monitor humane killing methods and the lack of data on euthanized orphaned joeys during legal culls. This ban will also extend to kangaroo skins used in products like sports shoes and motorbike jackets, reflecting a growing ethical stance against the entire trade, which also poses zoonotic pathogen risks.</p>

          <h2>Tiger Woods Undergoes Seventh Back Surgery, Future Comeback Uncertain</h2>

          <p>Golf legend Tiger Woods has undergone his seventh back surgery, this time to address a collapsed disc in his L4/5 lumbar spine, casting significant doubt on his future comeback to professional golf. The 15-time major winner experienced severe pain and lack of mobility, leading to the disc replacement procedure, which doctors at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York deemed successful. This operation follows another lumbar spine surgery just over a year ago and a ruptured Achilles tendon earlier this year, adding to his extensive injury history. Woods has not competed since the Open Championship in 2024, and his return to the sport remains highly uncertain given these persistent health challenges.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall in southeastern Mexico has caused severe flooding and landslides, resulting in at least 41 deaths across five states, with 27 people still missing. Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo were among the hardest-hit regions, where many fatalities occurred due to landslides. President Claudia Sheinbaum has deployed 6,700 soldiers for emergency relief operations, as at least 34,000 houses, hospitals, schools, and critical infrastructure, including roads, have been extensively damaged. Some communities remain cut off, and power outages affect 320,000 people, with restoration efforts underway. The extreme weather, partly attributed to tropical cyclones Priscilla and Raymond, is expected to bring further rain in the coming days, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <h2>UK Clocks to Go Back on October 26, Marking End of British Summer Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 19:32:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The clocks in the UK will go back by one hour on Sunday, October 26, at 02:00 BST, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, easily remembered by the phrase "spring forward, fall back," grants most people an extra hour of sleep or leisure. While it brings sunset forward by an hour, leading to gloomier winter mornings, particularly in Scotland, the practice dates back to World War One to maximize evening daylight and conserve fuel. Debates persist about making BST permanent for potential economic boosts and reduced road accidents, despite concerns over darker winter mornings, especially for Scottish commuters and schoolchildren.</p>
