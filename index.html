          <p>Iran's UN Ambassador, Amir-Saeid Iravani, stated that Iran's right to uranium enrichment will "never stop," asserting it as an inalienable right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He addressed accusations of threats against IAEA inspectors, claiming their activities are suspended due to a parliamentary law, not direct threats, while acknowledging individual criticisms exist. Iravani also commented on diplomacy with the U.S., indicating that current conditions are not suitable for new negotiations following recent American aggression. He characterized potential talks as a "give and take process," rejecting any form of unconditional surrender or dictated policy from Washington.</p>

          <p>Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb expressed concern over the Trump administration's public health policies, particularly the politicization of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). He argued that recent changes, driven by Secretary Kennedy, reflect long-held anti-vaccine sentiments and risk undermining public trust beyond just COVID-19 vaccines. Gottlieb specifically addressed the committee's advice on thimerosal in flu vaccines and the removal of CDC information debunking links to autism, calling it a tangible threat to vaccine access.

          <p>According to a Financial Times report, insiders at chipmaker Nvidia have sold more than $1 billion worth of company stock over the past year, with half of that amount sold in the last month alone. The sales coincided with the stock reaching new highs, driven by the AI boom. CEO Jensen Huang recently sold approximately $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of the year. Despite the significant insider selling, the company's stock rallied to a new record last week, briefly regaining its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This op-ed argues that the United States is dangerously vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for modern technology and defense. China's recent export controls and invasive licensing requirements, which demand sensitive company data, are described as "competitive surveillance." The article critiques years of inadequate responses from both Democratic and Republican administrations, stating that recent trade frameworks offer only a temporary reprieve without addressing the core dependency. It calls for a long-term, unified national strategy to build a complete and secure critical minerals supply chain, treating it as an instrument of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking on "Face the Nation," Warner warned that the legislation would increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over a decade while imposing cuts on healthcare, nutrition programs, and clean energy initiatives. He argued the bill would be particularly harmful to rural hospitals and food assistance programs. Despite provisions like an expanded Child Tax Credit, Warner dismissed them as "lipstick on a pig," predicting the bill's negative consequences would ultimately harm Republicans politically.

As an outspoken critic of Israel's government, Mamdani's success in a city with a large Jewish population suggests that such a stance is no longer a disqualifier for Democratic voters. The outcome reflects a growing dismay among many progressive voters, including some Jewish New Yorkers, over Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza. While some supporters see his win as a rejection of weaponizing antisemitism, others in the Jewish community express concern over his positions and what it signals for their safety and political influence.</p>

The RSPCA warns that dogs have a limited ability to cool down and can overheat quickly, leading to serious health issues or death. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. The advice is to avoid walks in the heat, check pavement temperature before going out, and provide plenty of cool water and shade. If a dog shows signs of overheating, it should be cooled with water immediately and taken to a vet.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury found Karen Read not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, but convicted her of driving under the influence. The verdict concluded a highly publicized retrial, after her first trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors had accused Read of striking O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow. However, her defense team successfully argued that she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, claiming O'Keefe was beaten inside a home and his body was moved outside.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a buyer has been secured for TikTok's U.S. operations, describing them as "a group of very wealthy people" and stating he would reveal their identity in about two weeks. The sale is part of an effort to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data through TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for the sale, with the current deadline set for September 17. The deal will likely require approval from the Chinese government, which President Trump expressed confidence in obtaining from President Xi. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>LeBron James will make NBA history by becoming the first person to play 23 seasons, after exercising his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2025-26 season. The 40-year-old superstar, who is the league's all-time leading scorer, was previously tied with Vince Carter for the most seasons played. This will be his eighth season with the Lakers, and he is now just 50 games away from breaking the record for most regular-season games played.

In a Fox News interview, Trump threatened potential prosecution for both the reporters and their sources if they do not comply. The president has been adamant that the strikes crippled Iran's nuclear program, dismissing the leaked assessmentâ€”which suggested only limited, temporary damageâ€”as biased and incomplete. This move represents a significant escalation in his administration's conflict with the media and raises serious questions about press freedom protections.</p>

When asked what should happen to these children, who are currently considered U.S. citizens, Mullin argued against separating families, stating, "they should go where their parents are."

The tribe and environmental groups fought for decades to safeguard the 230,000-acre region, which is vital for their culture and ceremonies.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina for his refusal to support the president's major tax and spending package, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill." In a social media post, Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against Tillis in his 2026 reelection campaign, calling his opposition a "BIG MISTAKE." Tillis, along with Senator Rand Paul, voted against advancing the legislation, citing concerns over cuts to Medicaid that would negatively impact his state's hospitals and rural communities. The bill narrowly passed a key procedural vote despite their opposition.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival organizers said they were "appalled" by comments made by the punk duo Bob Vylan during their performance on Saturday. The band's frontman, Bobby Vylan, led chants calling for "death to the IDF," referring to the Israel Defense Forces. In a statement, the festival and organizer Emily Eavis said the comments "very much crossed a line" and that there is no place for hate speech or incitement to violence at the event. The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service.</p>

          <p>Automaker Lotus has stated it has "no plans" to close any of its factories, following reports that it was considering ending production at its plant in Hethel, Norfolk, and opening a new facility in the US. The company admitted it is "actively exploring" global market options, a move potentially driven by US tariffs on imported cars. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said he was reassured by Lotus management of their commitment to UK operations. The potential move had raised concerns about the 1,300 jobs at the historic Hethel site, which is a significant part of Britain's automotive heritage.</p>

Investors will be closely watching the JOLTS report, the ADP private payrolls survey, and the official U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for June to gauge the health of the economy. Continuing jobless claims, which have been trending higher, will also be a focus. Additionally, the market will be looking for any news from the White House regarding trade negotiations with China and other countries, as deadlines for reciprocal tariffs approach in early July.
