          <p>House Republican leaders are urgently working to gather support for a significant domestic policy bill central to the Trump administration's agenda. The legislation, which already passed the Senate, faces opposition from both moderate and conservative GOP members in the House over changes made in the upper chamber, including deeper cuts to Medicaid. With a razor-thin majority and a looming deadline, the White House is directly engaging with holdouts to secure the necessary votes for the bill's final passage. The outcome remains uncertain as leadership navigates internal party friction and potential attendance issues.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has warned that a recent US decision to halt some weapons shipments could embolden Russia and prolong the ongoing war. The White House confirmed the pause, stating it was a result of a Defense Department review to prioritize American interests. Ukrainian officials emphasized their urgent need for air defense systems amid continuous Russian missile and drone attacks. While Kyiv's defense ministry awaits official notification, the move has caused significant concern, with the Kremlin suggesting that reduced arms flow will hasten the conflict's end.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks are expected to name Mike Brown as their next head coach, following the surprising dismissal of Tom Thibodeau after a successful playoff run. Brown, who most recently coached the Sacramento Kings, brings extensive experience, having previously led the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has coached legendary players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and served as an associate head coach for the Golden State Warriors during their championship years. While a formal contract has not been finalized, the move concludes the Knicks' wide-ranging search to find new leadership for the team.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to severely restrict access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" to justify the policy, unlawfully supplants the immigration laws established by Congress. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor existing statutes grant the executive branch the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system. The order has been temporarily stayed for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal the decision, which marks a significant setback for its immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The decision blocks a plan to end the program in September, months ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan stated that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws and that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently.</p>

          <p>A jury has delivered a split verdict in the trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, acquitting him of the most serious charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation for prostitution under the Mann Act, related to his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and another woman. The acquittal on the racketeering charge is a significant victory for his defense team, who argued his actions did not constitute a criminal enterprise.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed overview of the evidence in the Suzanne Morphew murder case, following the re-arrest of her husband, Barry Morphew. Key clues include a spy pen that revealed Suzanne's affair, which investigators believe was a motive after she asked for a divorce. Cell phone data, a tranquilizer dart needle cap found in the dryer, and Barry's multiple trash disposals on the day of her disappearance form the basis of the prosecution's theory. Despite the initial charges being dropped, the discovery of Suzanne's remains in 2023 led to Barry being charged with first-degree murder for a second time.</p>

          <p>Agricultural officials in Alabama recently euthanized a swarm of Africanized honeybees, commonly known as "killer bees," marking the latest sighting of the invasive insect in the United States. These bees are notoriously aggressive and defensive, known to attack humans and animals in large numbers and pursue threats for up to a mile. The subspecies poses a threat to native European honeybee populations and has been spotted in 13 states, with recent incidents in Texas and Arizona resulting in a fatality and multiple hospitalizations.

The payment resolves a lawsuit over a "60 Minutes" interview and will cover Trump's legal fees and help fund his presidential library. Critics have labeled the move a "spineless capitulation" and a "shameful decision" that sets a dangerous precedent, potentially emboldening attacks on news organizations.

          <p>Researchers are launching a new expedition to a remote Pacific island in hopes of solving the 88-year-old mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance. The mission was prompted by a 2015 satellite image of Nikumaroro island that may show part of Earhart's Lockheed Electra aircraft protruding from the sand. Purdue University, where Earhart taught, is organizing the trip to investigate the site, which may have been exposed by a cyclone. While some experts are skeptical, proponents point to the object's size and location near Earhart's intended route as strong evidence justifying the new search for the long-lost plane.</p>

The piece also highlights the appointment of a pardoned January 6 rioter to a Justice Department group and Paramount's legal settlement with Trump.

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to breed and release billions of sterile male screwworm flies over Mexico and southern Texas. This effort aims to combat the flesh-eating larvae of the New World Screwworm, a pest that can devastate livestock, wildlife, and occasionally infect humans. The technique involves releasing irradiated sterile males to mate with wild females, whose eggs then fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This biological control method, which successfully eradicated the pest from the U.S. decades ago, is being revived as the fly has reappeared in southern Mexico.</p>

          <p>For those considering depositing a significant sum like $10,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD), this article outlines several key questions to ask first. Savers should evaluate whether a short-term or long-term CD is more advantageous, as current rate trends have inverted historical norms. It is also crucial to assess one's ability to keep such a large amount of money inaccessible for the entire term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Finally, individuals should compare the benefits of a CD against high-yield savings and money market accounts, which offer comparable rates with greater liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

The retirement announcement of Senator Thom Tillis, who cited a lack of bipartisanship after opposing the bill, highlights the risks for Republicans who defy the party line. Democrats are now targeting seats held by Tillis and another dissenting senator, Susan Collins, viewing them as key pickup opportunities.
