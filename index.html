          <p>A new defense agreement between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan creates a significant geopolitical dilemma for China, which has robust relationships with both countries, including a long-standing civilian nuclear program collaboration with Riyadh. Experts indicate that Beijing is wary of advancing this nuclear partnership to avoid provoking the United States or appearing to encourage nuclear proliferation. The pact, described by a senior Saudi official as encompassing "all military means," fuels regional concern over a perceived Israeli nuclear monopoly. This situation is further complicated by America's perceived hesitation to protect its allies, increasing Riyadh's unease and pressing China to navigate a delicate diplomatic path.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces clinched an 89-86 victory against the Phoenix Mercury in a dramatic Game 1 of the WNBA finals, overcoming a late deficit with a strong fourth-quarter performance led by A'ja Wilson and Dana Evans. This intense opener was overshadowed by significant off-court tension, as WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed player unrest. Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier, a players' union vice-president, had publicly criticized Engelbert for allegedly dismissing concerns about pay and officiating, claiming the league's leadership was "the worst in the world." While Engelbert refuted these specific accounts, she conceded the necessity of rebuilding trust with players, especially with the collective bargaining agreement nearing its expiration.</p>

          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' sentencing to over four years for prostitution-related offenses, his legal team announced plans to appeal the decision. Lawyers Teny Geragos and Alexandra Shapiro contend that the judge unfairly considered conduct for which Combs was acquitted, arguing the jury explicitly cleared him of sex trafficking and RICO counts. They assert the judge acted as a "13th juror," allowing the sentence to be driven by rejected allegations. While acknowledging the indefensible video of Combs assaulting Casandra Ventura, his defense maintains he has taken responsibility for domestic violence, but that was not the basis of his conviction. They argue further incarceration is senseless given the damage to his reputation and financial ruin.</p>

          <p>Many retained firefighters in the UK, who served their communities for decades as on-call emergency responders, are still waiting for their full pensions despite recent legal victories. Previously denied pension rights, the Fire Brigades Union successfully brought employment tribunal claims, leading to changes allowing claims dating back to 2000, and later, for their entire careers. However, administrative delays and the complexity of calculations continue to hinder payments, with some retirees, like 78-year-old Roger Dunton, expressing frustration. The West Yorkshire Pension Fund, managing these cases, acknowledges the complexity and is increasing resources to process claims, with backdated payments including interest.</p>

Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Steve Watson called this a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of necessary police action. The incident, declared an act of terrorism and potentially influenced by Islamist ideology, is under investigation by the police complaints watchdog, especially given the assailant's prior criminal history including a recent arrest for sexual assault.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein signed "Iryna's Law," a bill designed to increase checks on criminals released on bail and prohibit cashless bail for certain violent and repeat offenders. The legislation was prompted by the August murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, allegedly by a man with a history of arrests. While Stein, a Democrat, expressed reservations about aspects like restarting executions, he supported the bill for its focus on identifying high-risk individuals before bail decisions. The law, which prohibits cashless bail for specific crimes and limits judicial discretion, also controversially includes an amendment aiming to reintroduce execution by firing squad, which Stein vows to block.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly urged the University of Southern California (USC) to reject a higher education compact proposed by President Trump, which demands conservative policy shifts in exchange for federal funding. Newsom, who previously threatened to cut state funding to any California university agreeing to the compact, emphasized the importance of academic freedom, calling USC's deliberation a "false choice." The compact outlines conservative goals on admissions, diversity, free speech, and gender identity recognition. USC's interim President Beong-Soo Kim stated the university would consult various stakeholders before deciding, acknowledging the gravity of the offer.</p>

A draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, depicts Trump's face on one side and him pumping his fist after a 2014 near-assassination on the reverse, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." This initiative is enabled by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. However, existing provisions, like the Thayer Amendment, typically prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, raising questions about the legality of the proposed design.</p>

Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented, with Jackson criticizing the "grave misuse of our emergency docket" to disrupt lives. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a "win for the American people," arguing TPS was abused. Advocates, however, warned of "massive injuries" and potential deportations to unsafe conditions.</p>

          <p>Victoria Cruises Line (VCL) is facing accusations of fraud from dozens of customers who paid significant deposits for a three-year, around-the-world residential cruise that has repeatedly failed to set sail. Would-be residents, many of whom sold homes and made life-altering plans, discovered VCL does not own or lease the advertised ship. VCL claims it needs more customers to charter a vessel and denies intentionally harming anyone, citing administrative reasons for withheld refunds. However, consumer advocates and investigations reveal a web of shell companies and unpaid taxes, with Meta platforms criticized for not removing VCL's misleading advertisements.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicles growing by almost a third, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT). Combined with plug-in hybrids, electrified vehicles accounted for over half of all new car registrations last month. This surge is attributed to carmaker discounts, increased model choice, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme aimed at encouraging the transition from petrol and diesel cars. While businesses and fleets account for the majority of BEV purchases, private buyer numbers are rising, pushing zero-emission vehicles to over one in five new cars registered in 2025.</p>

          <p>Newly released court records reveal that a white Kansas sheriff’s deputy, Richard Fatherly, is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Charles Adair, a cuffed Black man. The affidavit states Fatherly pressed his knee into Adair's back for 86 seconds after he was returned to his cell, despite Adair being handcuffed, on his stomach, and having a severely injured leg. Adair, who had been arrested for misdemeanor traffic warrants, was diagnosed with a bone infection and schizophrenia. The autopsy listed the cause of death as complications from "mechanical asphyxia," fueling demands for public release of body camera footage and questions about Fatherly's continued freedom.</p>

The company, which is now entering administration, claims it passed most of the funds (£83 million) to other consortium firms, Loudwater Trade and Finance and Eric Beare Associates, and argues administrators should pursue them for the money. Doug Barrowman previously admitted receiving around £60 million, with a share going to a trust benefiting Baroness Mone.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to offer unaccompanied immigrant children aged 14 and older in government custody a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily self-deport, a significant shift in immigration policy. This initiative, outlined in a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services, excludes minors from Mexico. Immigration lawyers and advocates express alarm, arguing the offer could exploit vulnerable children and pressure them to waive legal rights, potentially leading to family separations and endangering them upon return. The policy echoes a previous, unverified scheme for adults and is criticized by congressional members for undermining due process and placing children at risk of trafficking.</p>

Judge Deborah Boardman acknowledged Roske's remorse and lack of prior criminal history but deemed the crime "absolutely reprehensible."

Scheduled flights between the two nations are operating normally, and South Korea continues to be a top destination for Chinese tourists. This resilience is attributed to both governments opposing the protests and the maintenance of public safety. However, experts caution that a potential decline in tourism could still occur if the Chinese embassy were to issue travel warnings, indicating that the situation, while stable for now, remains sensitive to official guidance and diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals a stark paradox in American sentiment: while an overwhelming majority across all political affiliations deem political violence unacceptable, they simultaneously anticipate an increase in such violence in the coming years. This apprehension is linked to a pervasive pessimism regarding the ability of different political groups to unite, despite a general belief that people, outside of politics, can get along. The poll also indicates that fewer than half of Americans feel comfortable expressing political views publicly, fearing negative repercussions like insults, threats, or employment problems, highlighting a growing erosion of civility and open dialogue.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allegedly ordered drone attacks on two Gaza-bound humanitarian aid vessels off the Tunisian coast last month, according to American intelligence officials. Drones reportedly launched from a submarine dropped incendiary devices onto the boats, causing fires, though no casualties were reported.

The Global Sumud Flotilla, which organized the initiative to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza, condemned the attacks, calling for independent investigations.
