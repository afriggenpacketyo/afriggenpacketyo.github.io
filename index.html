          <p>Authorities have identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect in a deadly ambush on Idaho firefighters. Roley allegedly set a brush fire to lure first responders, then opened fire, killing firefighters Frank Harwood and John Morrison and injuring a third. The suspect was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a nearby wooded area. Investigators revealed that Roley, who was living as a transient in his vehicle, had previously expressed a desire to become a firefighter, though his exact motive remains unclear. The attack is being condemned as a heinous and direct assault on emergency personnel.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has reportedly been offered a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. An attorney for the family of victim Kaylee Goncalves confirmed the offer, which prompted a furious reaction from the family, who stated on social media that they felt failed by the state of Idaho. The deal comes just weeks before the scheduled trial, which was moved to Boise over concerns about a fair hearing. Evidence in the case includes DNA linking Kohberger to a knife sheath found at the scene and data tracking his car and phone.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is confronting a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to disability benefits, specifically the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is engaged in a major effort to persuade dozens of his own MPs who oppose the reforms. Critics within the party are concerned that the changes, intended to manage a rising benefits bill, are being rushed to meet fiscal targets without proper review. The debate highlights a core tension within Labour between maintaining economic credibility and upholding traditional party values regarding the welfare state.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has entered a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's major tax and spending bill. Republicans are aiming to pass the legislation by a self-imposed July 4 deadline using the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority. Democrats are using the procedure to force votes on numerous amendments, putting Republicans on the record regarding controversial cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The bill, which the CBO estimates will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit, faces opposition from a few key Republican senators, making its final passage uncertain.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina detention officer, 56-year-old Francisco Flattes, was fatally shot after an inmate allegedly seized his weapon during a medical visit. The inmate, identified as 48-year-old Kelvin Simmons, was being escorted by two officers for an orthopedic treatment when a scuffle broke out. After the shooting, Simmons reportedly carjacked a vehicle and fled but was later apprehended. Simmons, a federal inmate facing bank robbery charges, will now also be charged with first-degree murder.

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine functions as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This discovery helps explain the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The findings could also lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, offering new avenues for promoting longevity and health.</p>

This expansion is part of a larger trend that has seen China's net coffee imports grow over 6.5 times between 2020 and 2024, creating a $42 billion industry. However, some observers question the sustainability of this rural cafe craze, noting that many shops rely on unique, picturesque settings to attract social media-savvy customers for one-time visits.

This data point offers a snapshot of the current sentiment within one of the most crucial sectors of the Japanese economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sweeping legislative proposal by President Trump is generating a mix of anxiety and excitement among Americans who would be directly affected by its provisions. The bill's cuts to programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid are causing fear for recipients who rely on them for food and healthcare. Conversely, provisions like eliminating federal income tax on tips and overtime are being celebrated by workers such as firefighters. The legislation also includes phasing out green energy tax credits, worrying small business owners in the solar industry about potential layoffs and economic hardship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has requested that the Trump administration return 200 soldiers to California's state command. The troops were federalized to respond to immigration-related protests, but with unrest decreasing and fire season intensifying, there is a critical need for them to resume firefighting duties. Governor Gavin Newsom has been a vocal critic of the federalization, calling it illegal and highlighting that the state's specialized firefighting Guard unit is severely understaffed. The request underscores the tension between federal deployments and state-level emergency response needs.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that a new wave of younger investors is driving market trends by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over established firms that prioritize stock buybacks. He argues that this demographic sees buybacks as a sign a company has run out of ideas, instead rewarding firms like Robinhood and Reddit for their potentially transformative business models. According to Cramer, this has created an "idea market" where individual company stories and growth potential are more influential than macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve policy. This shift in investor behavior could be reshaping market valuations and rewarding disruptive companies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from UK child health experts suggests that falling childhood vaccination rates are often due to practical and logistical obstacles rather than vaccine hesitancy. Parents face difficulties such as booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders, which prevent them from getting their children vaccinated on schedule. This decline has led to the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health recommends improving access through NHS apps, expanding vaccination services, and better utilizing health visitors to support families.</p>

          <p>This article examines the divisive impact of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the U.S. Health Secretary under the Trump administration, where he has launched a mission to tackle chronic disease. While his focus on issues like harmful food additives has gained some support, his tenure is marked by deep controversy due to his history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies about vaccines, autism, and other topics. Kennedy has dismantled parts of the CDC and other health agencies, drawing ire from the scientific community. His approach creates a paradox: bringing attention to neglected health areas while potentially undermining public health science.</p>

          <p>Energy bills for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to decrease by about 7% starting in July, according to the latest price cap from regulator Ofgem. This provides some immediate relief, equating to a drop of around Â£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, raising concerns about affordability during the upcoming winter. With future wholesale prices subject to global uncertainty, consumers are being encouraged to explore fixed-rate deals that could offer more stability.</p>

The breakthrough came from a combination of surveillance footage of Kohberger's car, cell phone data, and cutting-edge genetic genealogy that linked his father's DNA to a knife sheath left at the scene.

Government attorneys contend the gang constitutes a "hybrid criminal state" and that courts lack the power to overrule the president's invocation of the act.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system, envisioned as an American version of Israel's Iron Dome, is a key part of its strategy to counter China's military modernization. The project, which would rely on a sophisticated network of satellites and space-based sensors to intercept long-range missiles, aims to bolster U.S. defenses and deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific.
