          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. According to President Trump, the Philippines will eliminate all tariffs on U.S. goods, a detail Manila has not yet confirmed, while Indonesia will drop tariffs for 99% of its trade with the U.S. The deals also include provisions for military cooperation with the Philippines and the removal of Indonesian export restrictions on critical minerals. These agreements were reached ahead of an August 1 deadline for countries to secure trade deals or face higher U.S. tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The general manager of the Washington Commanders and the D.C. mayor have expressed little concern over President Trump's recent comments about the football team's name. Trump had threatened to block the team's plans for a new stadium in the capital unless they reverted to their former name, the Redskins. Mayor Muriel Bowser indicated she remains focused on finalizing the stadium deal, suggesting a blockage is unlikely and noting the president is a fan of quarterback Jayden Daniels. Similarly, Commanders GM Adam Peters stated that the team is concentrating on its on-field performance and not on non-football-related matters like the stadium or name controversy.</p>

          <h2>India Defeats England by 13 Runs to Secure Women's ODI Series Victory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:49:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's women's cricket team clinched a 2-1 series victory over England after winning the final one-day international by 13 runs. Chasing a record 319 for victory, England's captain Nat Sciver-Brunt scored 98, but her dismissal proved to be a turning point. Despite contributions from the lower order, England was bowled out for 305. India's strong performance was anchored by captain Harmanpreet Kaur's century and a remarkable bowling display from 21-year-old Kranti Goud, who took six wickets. The result leaves England with significant challenges to address before the upcoming World Cup in India.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the current 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs between the United States and China will likely be extended beyond its August 12 expiration. Bessent expressed optimism about the state of trade relations, stating that upcoming talks in Stockholm will address the extension and other economic issues. The discussions aim to persuade Beijing to reduce its manufacturing surplus and curb its purchase of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. This development follows a period of intense trade conflict where both nations had imposed tariffs exceeding 100% before agreeing to a temporary truce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors and Stellantis are experiencing substantial financial impacts from U.S. tariff policies, with GM reporting a $1.1 billion hit to its profits in a single quarter. The tariffs have reduced GM's profit margin from a target of 9% to 6.1%, and the company's stock fell following the announcement. Similarly, Stellantis, owner of Chrysler and Jeep, paid nearly $400 million in tariffs. Industry data suggests that automakers are largely absorbing these costs rather than passing them on to consumers, who are already facing high average vehicle prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to resume sales of Nvidia's H20 AI chip to China has been criticized by some U.S. officials. The approval reverses a ban from April and was part of a broader trade deal in which the U.S. eased some export controls in exchange for access to Chinese rare earth minerals. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the move, stating the goal is to get Chinese developers accustomed to American technology stacks without providing them with top-tier hardware. However, the decision has raised concerns about consistency, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously denied any "quid pro quo" involving chips for minerals. (not investment advice)</p>

According to a report from FilmLA, the decline was driven by significant drops in feature film and commercial production. However, television production was a bright spot, showing a 17% increase, its highest level since early 2024, thanks to gains in TV dramas and reality shows. The overall numbers remain well below the five-year average, though recent expansions to California's film and TV tax credit program aim to boost local production.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the pioneering frontman of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. Remembered as the "prince of darkness," he was celebrated for his wailing vocals and wild stage persona, which helped define the image of a rock star. After being fired from Black Sabbath for his struggles with addiction, he launched a highly successful solo career and later became an unlikely reality TV star with "The Osbournes." Despite a life of controversy and health battles, Osbourne reunited with his bandmates and was honored by a generation of musicians he influenced, cementing his legacy in rock history.</p>

The suspect, Raymond Boodarian, allegedly told a 911 operator that police were not needed. This revelation has intensified community frustration over recent crimes in the Encino area.</p>

          <p>DuPont's stock value increased after China’s market regulation authority suspended an antitrust investigation into its Chinese operations, which was widely viewed as retaliation for U.S. tariffs. The probe, which began in April, focused on DuPont's Tyvek business, a relatively small portion of its total sales. The suspension removes a significant overhang for the company, particularly alleviating concerns that the inquiry could disrupt the planned spinoff of its electronics division. This positive development comes ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report, with some analysts viewing it as a catalyst for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The announced intention of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to personally meet with convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell is being examined as a highly unusual prosecutorial step. This article suggests the meeting is driven by political incentives, as Maxwell likely desires a reduced sentence while the Justice Department may seek information to benefit President Trump politically. Any potential cooperation from Maxwell would face extreme scrutiny, given her conviction and the timing of her offer years after the initial investigation. The analysis highlights that the credibility of any information she provides would be a major hurdle in any future legal proceedings based on her testimony.</p>

He acquired the Times in 2018, returning it to local ownership, but the newspaper has continued to face financial struggles and staff reductions common in the media industry.

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a £63.5 million deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting. While personal terms and a five-year contract have been agreed upon, the completion of the transfer has been slightly delayed by negotiations over add-on payments. The 27-year-old has been a top target for manager Mikel Arteta, who is looking to add elite firepower to his squad. Gyokeres had an exceptional season in Portugal, scoring 54 goals in 52 games, and his signing is seen as a key move to bolster Arsenal's attack ahead of the new season.</p>

This flexibility is seen as a key strength, especially as the market adjusts to shifting demand and the upcoming end of federal EV tax credits.</p>
