          <p>China's first police corgi was filmed pilfering a sausage from a child during a patrol, leading to a public reprimand. The incident prompted officials to enroll the dog in a training program focused on resisting food temptations. This reflects a broader effort to refine the skills of police dogs and improve community relations. The corgi's misbehavior highlights the challenges of training animals for law enforcement duties and ensuring they adhere to behavioral standards in public settings.

          <p>Learning new languages physically rewires the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, as demonstrated by a German study tracking Syrian refugees learning German. Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reshape neural pathways, strengthens areas related to language processing and executive function. Studies suggest that children learn languages more easily due to their brain's greater adaptability, processing new languages independently rather than translating from their first language. While multilingualism improves memory and problem-solving, it's uncertain whether it directly correlates with higher intelligence, as cognitive skills involve numerous factors beyond language learning.</p>

          <p>Jack Goldsmith argues that Donald Trump's expansion of presidential power builds on excesses by previous administrations, revealing the office's latent authority. He notes similarities between Trump's actions and those of Nixon, Bush, Obama, and Biden, highlighting a decades-long escalation of power grabs. Goldsmith calls for reforms to limit presidential authority and restore Congress's vital role in policymaking. He suggests potential constitutional amendments to narrow the pardon power and confine Justice Department politicization, emphasizing the need for a leader with "checks and balances incorporated within his own breast."</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a highly effective antivenom using the blood of Tim Friede, who has been intentionally bitten by numerous species of deadly snakes over 18 years. Friede's self-immunization process made him "hyper-immune" to snake neurotoxins, allowing researchers to isolate target antibodies from his blood. The resulting antivenom protected mice against venom from various deadly snakes, including black mambas and king cobras. Researchers hope this broad-spectrum antivenom, potentially delivered via a "venom EpiPen," could be widely deployed in rural settings, improving treatment for snake bites globally.</p>

The episode highlights the importance of healthspan—extending the period of healthy living—and reframing aging positively. Dr. Rabheru's advice includes the "rule of 20s": 20 smiles, 20 minutes of activity, and 20 minutes of socialization daily.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the office responsible for leading the 'Safe to Sleep' campaign, raising concerns about the future of safe sleep education for parents. The campaign, which began as 'Back to Sleep' in 1994, significantly reduced sleep-related infant deaths by promoting practices like placing babies on their backs on firm mattresses. Despite the campaign's success, sleep-related infant deaths have recently increased, possibly due to limited access to healthcare information during the pandemic. Nonprofits will continue education efforts, but lack the resources to replace the NIH's contributions.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate skeptical of the EU and against military support for Ukraine, secured a significant victory in the first round of the Romanian presidential election rerun. Simion garnered 40.96% of the vote and is favored to win the runoff against liberal mayor Nicusor Dan. His support is particularly strong among the Romanian diaspora, and a potential Simion victory is viewed with concern in European capitals and Washington. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania, and a visa-waiver agreement was recently cancelled.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he is directing his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house the “most ruthless offenders.” He claimed America has been plagued by violent criminals and should lock them away from society. The plan faces practical challenges due to the island's crumbling infrastructure and high costs, as the prison was closed in 1963 for similar reasons. The island is now a national park and tourist attraction, leading to questions about the feasibility and seriousness of Trump's proposal.</p>

India has accused Pakistan of involvement, a claim Pakistan denies. The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947 when the region's fate was left undecided during the partition of India. Tensions have escalated, with India vowing severe punishment and Pakistan asserting its readiness to respond to any military misadventure. International efforts are underway to de-escalate the situation, but the risk of miscalculation remains high.</p>

Trump cited a "National Security threat" due to other countries offering incentives to draw filmmakers away from the US. Australia's location offset scheme, offering a 30% rebate for big-budget projects, may no longer be attractive enough for US-aimed productions. The arts minister is monitoring the situation closely, as foreign productions significantly contribute to Australia's screen industry revenue.</p>
