          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump’s trade war, which has involved tariffs disrupting global supply chains. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Despite Trump hailing the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about a quick deal, warning that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation. The article suggests that while Trump may tout any concessions made by China as a win, significant challenges remain in reaching a comprehensive agreement.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has launched an unprecedented smear campaign against Ukraine, urging citizens to vote against Ukraine's EU accession. This campaign involves pro-government media platforms spreading propaganda lies that portray Ukraine as a center of drug trafficking and organized crime. Orban's motives are largely driven by domestic politics, as he faces growing opposition led by Peter Magyar, whose Respect and Freedom party is gaining popularity. The article suggests that Orban is attempting to discredit Magyar by linking him to a supposed pro-Ukrainian war party financed by Brussels, while also appealing to revisionist sentiments among his base.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump continues to criticize the U.S. media as fake news, but some news organizations are accused of bending to his will, with billionaire owners allegedly prioritizing Trump's favor over journalistic independence. Examples include Jeff Bezos allegedly ordering a more favorable editorial stance at the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times dropping its endorsement of Kamala Harris. CBS News is said to be considering settling a $10 billion lawsuit brought against the network over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview.

          <p>Pakistan's Chinese-made weapons have demonstrated strength against India’s Western and Russian ones in the recent clash over Kashmir, but analysts caution that it is too soon to determine which side’s arms technology will prove superior in combat.

India deployed its fighter jet fleets, including French-made Rafale jets, while Islamabad claimed to have shot down five Indian aircraft, including Rafales.

This arrangement provides the support of an extended family but through chosen connections.

          <p>A discussion about doomsday prepping in America reveals that about half of Americans engage in some kind of preparedness for adverse events, according to a 2023 FEMA survey. The article explores the reasons behind this phenomenon, arguing that prepping is an American institution rooted in self-sufficiency and a lack of reliance on government support. While the ultra-rich often engage in conspicuous consumption through extravagant preparation plans, prepping is also prevalent among the middle class due to ongoing extreme weather events and a perceived inadequate state response. The article considers the political implications of individual versus collective approaches to confronting disasters.</p>

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that engines from Rolls-Royce and similar plane parts would be able to enter the US market without tariffs. The UK businesses secretary confirmed that the wider aerospace industry would have “a specific guarantee of zero tariffs” in the agreement, providing certainty to a £40bn sector supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK. The deal also benefits the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners.</p>

The US played a decisive role in mediating the ceasefire after four days of intense hostilities. Analysts from both countries agreed that the US mediation provided a useful off-ramp for both nations. While the ceasefire may mark the end of the worst military confrontation in 25 years, it will not easily lead to an enduring peace.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article delves into the impact of sibling relationships on personal development, drawing from research indicating that siblings often mold each other's personalities. The phenomenon known as the “sibling spillover effect” is particularly powerful in disadvantaged families. While birth order psychology may not hold up in studies, younger siblings are sometimes more competitive athletes. The article highlights that parents can be poor judges of their own kids, and genetic inclinations elicit responses from the world that shape personalities.</p>

          <p>Germany has begun rejecting asylum seekers at its borders, marking the first such action since the new government tightened immigration controls. In the two days since the policy was implemented, 19 asylum seekers were turned away, primarily due to invalid visas or fake documents. The move is part of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's efforts to curb illegal migrant entries, citing that Germany is surrounded by safe EU states. The policy has drawn criticism from German politicians and neighboring EU countries, raising concerns about European law and border congestion.</p>
