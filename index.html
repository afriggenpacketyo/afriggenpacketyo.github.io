          <h2>Trump Voters Express Confidence in Economic Handling Amidst Concerns Over Prices and Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite overall disapproval of President Trump's handling of the economy and tariffs, a majority of his 2024 voters remain confident in his leadership. These voters believe Trump's economic policies will strengthen the U.S. in the long term, though some acknowledge the potential for a short-term recession. While some Trump voters expressed concerns about the impact of tariffs on prices, they generally support his efforts to bring jobs back to America and believe he is capable of turning the economy around. The poll reveals mixed feelings, with some voters appreciating his border crackdown but disagreeing with his views on LGBTQ issues and abortion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has been marked by executive actions aimed at overhauling the federal government and pushing his agenda, though economic promises have not fully materialized. Polls indicate broad economic anxiety among Americans, and Trump's approval rating is the lowest for any president in the past 80 years. The Republican Party faces potential political liabilities, while Democrats are undergoing soul-searching to determine their future messaging and leadership. Intraparty tensions are evident as Democrats debate how to reach moderates and fight against the Republican Party, with some advocating for mass protests and others doubling down on progressive values.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has launched a platform to coordinate responses to disruptions affecting undersea cables, a move prompted by accusations against Beijing for recent incidents impacting the island's communications. The Regional Response Platform for Submarine Cable Security includes the coastguard, prosecutors, telecoms operators, and investigators to address cable-related crime. This initiative underscores the critical importance of undersea cables as Taiwan's "digital lifeline," especially following two major incidents of damage earlier this year. The platform aims to facilitate cooperation among various agencies to effectively crack down on criminal activities targeting these vital submarine cables.</p>

          <p>Despite earlier reports of reduced US film imports, major American productions are set for release in China, suggesting a temporary reprieve in potential Hollywood restrictions. Disney's "Thunderbolts" and "Lilo & Stitch" are expected to premiere in Chinese cinemas, indicating a possible holding pattern amid trade tensions. However, Hollywood continues to face declining revenues in China as audiences increasingly favor domestically produced films.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Albania has experienced significant deforestation in recent decades, with approximately 6.5% of its forest area lost in the past 20 years, despite a moratorium on commercial logging. Illegal logging persists, driven by the demand for high-quality beech wood, particularly from Italy, where it is used to manufacture wood products for the US market. Local authorities are responsible for managing forests, but enforcement is lacking, and some companies exploit loopholes to cut down valuable trees under the guise of firewood harvesting. The European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR) has limited effectiveness in preventing illegal timber from entering the EU market due to corruption and inadequate enforcement.</p>

The bloc is also concerned about the impact of ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and other partners, like China.

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured victory in Canada's federal election, fueled by a backlash against President Trump's trade threats and comments undermining Canadian sovereignty. Carney's campaign emphasized leadership and economic survival, portraying Trump as a threat to Canada's independence. While the Conservative opposition made significant gains, they fell short of securing a majority, and leader Pierre Poilievre lost his own parliamentary seat. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, with the Liberals largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan, while the New Democrats experienced a collapse in support.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to have lost his seat in the House of Commons, according to CBC, marking a significant blow after his party's defeat nationwide by Mark Carney's Liberal Party.

He faced opposition from a protest group advocating for electoral reform and struggled to distance himself from Trump's policies. Poilievre had held his seat since 2005 and rose to power in 2022 as leader of the Conservative Party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to bypass immigration courts in an effort to expedite deportations, raising concerns about due process. Changes include removing deportation protections, canceling legal representation grants for children, and transferring individuals to prisons outside U.S. jurisdiction. Experts warn that these actions erode due process rights for immigrants and could potentially impact lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens. Critics argue that access to an impartial judge is essential to prevent erroneous removals and ensure fair proceedings, while the administration contends that due process is hindering its ability to remove criminals from the country.</p>

The list of targets exceeds 100, ranging from prominent Democratic politicians to international students, with agencies such as the Justice Department, Defense Department, and IRS involved.

A majority believes grocery prices will increase, and nearly 60% think tariffs on imports will hurt the U.S. economy.

          <p>Dr. Victoria McCloud, the UK's only openly transgender judge, plans to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex at the European Court of Human Rights. McCloud argues that the judgment and equality watchdog's guidance violate her human rights, leaving her feeling "contained and segregated." The Supreme Court's ruling defines a woman by biological sex under equalities law, which McCloud contends fails to consider the impact on trans people. She says she is now legally "two sexes at once" because she has a Gender Recognition Certificate but is defined as a man for the purposes of the Equality Act.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars has announced plans to cut costs by 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) and has withdrawn its financial guidance following a sharp decline in operating profit for the first three months of the year. The company's operating profit fell to 1.9 billion krona, down from 4.7 billion krona in the same period last year, with a narrowed EBIT margin. The cost and cash action plan will include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations. Volvo Cars cited tariff pressure and broader automotive industry turbulence as reasons for withdrawing its financial guidance.</p>

Currently, mammograms can only be undertaken by female radiographers, but the SoR believes that opening the role to men could help recruit more qualified professionals. While some women express concerns about having a male radiographer, others, like breast cancer survivor Sally Reed, believe that life-saving screenings should be accessible regardless of the provider's gender.

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy substitutes, and reducing the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy. This proposal aims to tackle obesity and incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar content in their products. The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the Treasury argues that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar. The government estimates that a significant portion of milk-based drinks on the market would be affected by the tax unless their sugar content is reduced.</p>
