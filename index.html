          <p>Jill Sobule, the singer-songwriter known for her 1995 hit “I Kissed a Girl,” which brought a queer theme into mainstream pop, died in a house fire in Woodbury, Minnesota, at the age of 66. Sobule, celebrated for her sharp wit and dramatic songwriting, explored characters grappling with their internal lives and societal perceptions. Her self-titled 1995 album also featured the song “Supermodel,” which appeared in the movie “Clueless”. Sobule continued to record, perform, and contribute to television, including the theme song for Nickelodeon’s “Unfabulous,” and her autobiographical musical, “F*ck7thGrade,” is set for a June release. Optimism score should be low due to the death of a well known person.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants, which had been granted by the Biden administration. This action follows the homeland security secretary's termination of an 18-month extension of TPS, prompting a lawsuit alleging violations of administrative procedures and racial bias. A federal judge blocked the administration's efforts, citing irreparable harm to hundreds of thousands of people, economic costs, and public health concerns, but the administration is now seeking Supreme Court intervention.</p>

The company provided weaker-than-expected profit guidance for the second quarter and full year, citing challenging economic conditions and the impact of President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. CFO Amrita Ahuja highlighted that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, despite the market's negative reaction. (not investment advice)</p>
