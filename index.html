          <p>The UK and India have officially agreed to a trade deal after three years of negotiations, which aims to reduce tariffs on various goods and services between the two countries. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export products like whisky and cars to India, while also cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. Expected to boost trade by an additional £25.5 billion a year by 2040, the deal includes provisions on services and procurement, allowing British firms to compete for more contracts. Both Prime Ministers Starmer and Modi hailed the agreement as a significant milestone that will promote economic growth and job creation in their respective countries.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Friedrich Merz secured the chancellorship of Germany in a second parliamentary vote, overcoming an unprecedented initial defeat. Merz failed to secure an absolute majority in the first secret ballot, creating hours of uncertainty and confusion in the Bundestag. Despite his coalition's expected majority, some members dissented, leading to the need for a second vote, which he ultimately won with a margin of nine votes. Merz was then sworn in as chancellor, averting a potential political crisis and paving the way for his team of 17 ministers to take office, signaling the creation of a stable government ready to tackle pressing issues like migration and the economy.</p>

          <p>This article from the New York Times profiles Friedrich Merz, Germany's newly elected chancellor, highlighting his background, political approach, and the challenges he faces. Despite securing the chancellorship after a second round of voting in Parliament, Merz enters office at a critical time for Germany's economy, security, and European role. Critics point to his tendency to break promises and struggle with long-term planning, while supporters emphasize his preparedness and potential to address key issues like growth, defense, and immigration. The article suggests that Merz's ability to wrangle lawmakers and confront domestic and international crises will be crucial as he leads Germany forward.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the growing resistance among Russian parents and teachers to the Kremlin's "patriotic education" initiatives in schools, which aim to indoctrinate children with pro-war and nationalistic ideologies. Some schools are creating fake schedules to avoid propaganda classes, while parents are opting for homeschooling or helping their children navigate the system discreetly. Despite the increasing pressure from the government, many teachers are quietly sabotaging the lessons by using the time for revision or homework, reflecting a widespread desire to shield children from misinformation and promote critical thinking about the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of over 10% despite the company's ongoing revenue growth acceleration, driven by strong U.S. commercial sector performance. Analysts raised concerns about the modest full-year revenue guidance increase, the sequential margin decline, and the year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma noted that Palantir's high software multiple makes it vulnerable to compression as revenue growth slows, despite the company exceeding revenue expectations and increasing its revenue guidance for the year.</p>

The groups also suggest examining wasteful water use in cities and industries, highlighting the need for a sustainable future for the Colorado River and the 40 million people who depend on it, as reservoirs continue to decline due to overuse and climate change.</p>

He suggests that any tariff reductions would still represent the largest tax increases since the 1960s, negatively impacting economic growth, and that stocks have not yet reached their bottom as macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate.

          <p>The Trump administration's dismissal of authors behind the sixth National Climate Assessment (NCA6) has raised concerns about the future of climate research and international collaborations. Experts warn that the US's retreat from climate science leadership could have global repercussions, with some scientists considering relocating overseas. The move has prompted international scientific organizations to bolster their efforts in climate research to fill the void left by the US, emphasizing the importance of global cooperation in addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>The federal government has resumed collecting on defaulted student loans, ending a five-year pause that began during the Covid-19 pandemic, with potential consequences for nearly 43 million Americans.

          <p>This article from The Guardian examines how Ohio has become a hotbed of white supremacism, with its influence spreading globally, often with deadly consequences. The article highlights examples such as Christopher Brenner Cook, a convicted terrorist from Ohio who sexually abused and radicalized a teenager in England who later committed suicide. It also notes the rise of neo-Nazi publicity efforts and the presence of far-right Republicans in Ohio politics, suggesting a growing acceptance and normalization of extremist views in the state.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cuts EPA Staff, Raising Health Concerns</h2>

          <p>Experts and advocacy groups are expressing concerns over potential risks to Americans' health due to the Trump administration's decision to cut staffing at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to levels last seen in the 1980s. The cuts, including a $300 million budget reduction and the reorganization of the office of research and development (ORD), are expected to undermine scientific independence and compromise the EPA's ability to protect human health and the environment. Critics argue that these changes will transform the EPA into a purely political agency, prioritizing energy and manufacturing over scientific research and environmental protection.</p>
