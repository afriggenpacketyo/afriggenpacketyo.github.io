          <p>This article reflects on the first anniversary of former President Joe Biden's decision to end his 2024 re-election campaign, a move that significantly altered the political landscape. The withdrawal followed a widely criticized debate performance and growing pressure from within the Democratic party over concerns about his age and electability against Donald Trump. The piece details the events leading to his exit, his endorsement of Kamala Harris, and the subsequent investigations into his use of an autopen and mental fitness. It frames the decision as a pivotal moment with lasting repercussions for the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Prominent Kenyan human rights activist and government critic, Boniface Mwangi, has been charged with possession of ammunition amid an investigation into "facilitating terrorist activities." The charges are linked to his alleged role in organizing recent anti-government protests that turned violent, resulting in numerous deaths. Authorities claim to have found teargas canisters and a blank round at his home, which his lawyer denies. His arrest occurs during a period of heightened unrest in Kenya, sparked by the death of a political blogger in police custody and ongoing demonstrations against corruption.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration in federal court, arguing that the freezing and cutting of $2.6 billion in federal research grants were illegal. The university contends the cuts are a retaliatory measure after it refused to comply with demands from a federal antisemitism task force regarding campus policies, academics, and admissions. Harvard states these actions jeopardize vital scientific and medical research, while the administration maintains it has discretion to cancel grants that no longer align with government policy. The case represents a significant confrontation over academic freedom and government control over higher education.</p>

The move, pushed by Governor Greg Abbott during a special session initially called for flood disaster relief, is seen by Democrats as a partisan power grab that exploits legal loopholes and undermines voting rights. Critics argue the plan is an attempt at "election theft" and that it will create racially discriminatory maps.

The commission will investigate why savings rates are low and aim to build a national consensus on solutions to prevent future financial hardship.

The research note suggests that the most effective way to break this cycle is to expand market demand by boosting domestic consumption, thereby creating an "incremental cake" for businesses.

          <p>This analysis argues that Chief Justice John Roberts has been instrumental in expanding the power of the American presidency, creating a constitutional framework that enables a more authoritarian executive. The article details how Roberts, through key majority opinions, has legitimized broad presidential authority in areas like national security, congressional oversight, and the firing of executive branch officials. These decisions, rooted in the unitary executive theory, have redefined the presidency as a nearly monarchical, one-person branch of government. The author contends that this judicial reshaping provides the constitutional legitimacy for President Trump's sweeping exercises of power, fundamentally altering the system of checks and balances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly favored tariffs over traditional sanctions as its primary tool for international economic pressure, aligning with the "America First" agenda. This approach allows for unilateral and rapid action without congressional approval, suiting the president's desire for flexible leverage on issues ranging from trade deficits to immigration. While tariffs generate revenue, critics warn this strategy, dubbed the "tariff tango," creates global trade uncertainty and could be linked to broader de-globalization and conflict. The administration has also blurred the lines by using tariffs for objectives typically reserved for sanctions, such as pressuring allies on non-trade issues. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials attribute a record 2.24 billion passenger trips in the first half of 2025 to this enhanced connectivity, improved service quality, and rising travel demand. The nation is on schedule to achieve its ambitious goal of having 50,000km of high-speed rail by the end of the year.</p>

The rules require cadres to act with fairness in personnel matters and lead by example to earn the trust of their soldiers.

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis, the parent company of brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Vauxhall, has announced that US tariffs have cost it €300 million. The financial impact stems from the 25% tariff on imported cars imposed by the Trump administration, which has disrupted trade and reduced the company's planned production. Shipments to North America dropped by 25% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, contributing to a 10% decline in total sales. This report highlights the significant real-world consequences of the administration's tariff policies on global car manufacturers and their supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

The landmark report's most significant recommendation is to scrap the economic regulator, Ofwat, and create a single, unified water regulator for England and another for Wales. The review also calls for more control over company ownership, greater accountability for executives, and reforms to self-monitoring practices to rebuild public trust. It warns that while bills may need to rise to fund necessary infrastructure investment, there are no quick fixes to the sector's deep-rooted problems.</p>

          <p>Food giant Kraft Heinz is reportedly exploring a major strategic shift by potentially spinning off a significant portion of its grocery business, including legacy Kraft brands like Velveeta. This move is seen as an attempt to undo the largely unsuccessful 2015 mega-merger, which has seen the company's stock value plummet as consumers shift away from processed foods. The plan would separate slower-growing products from more profitable brands like Heinz ketchup, aiming to unlock shareholder value by creating two distinct entities.
