The announcement followed frustration from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks, and previous ceasefire attempts had failed.

The ACLU argued that the deportations would violate due process rights, while the Trump administration claimed the detainees were "foreign terrorists." The ACLU had sued to block the deportations, citing concerns about the treatment of migrants sent to El Salvador under the same act.</p>
