          <p>Meta Platforms is signaling a more cautious approach towards its open-source artificial intelligence models, a strategic shift that contrasts with China's aggressive development in the same field. Tech experts, including Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive, 'Darwinian' open-source ecosystem is rapidly closing the gap with US AI capabilities. Recently, Chinese firms like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have released powerful new open-source models, claiming top performance benchmarks. This development highlights the escalating global competition in AI and differing philosophies on technology sharing.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv, assuring them of President Trump's commitment to securing the captives' release from Gaza. The meeting occurred during protests where families expressed growing desperation, especially after Hamas released videos showing hostages in emaciated conditions. The article also notes the dire humanitarian situation at aid distribution sites in Gaza, where hundreds have been killed in recent months. Witkoff's visit underscores the intense diplomatic and public pressure to resolve the nearly 22-month-long crisis.</p>

The resort noted that the effort, involving 150 employees, aims to care for the natural environment. In past cleanups, they have even been able to reunite valuable lost items, like an engraved engagement ring, with their owners.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill by Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The animal, named Winston, was a diplomatic offering during World War II but died just days before reaching England. For decades, it was rumored that the platypus died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research suggests the creature more likely succumbed to heatstroke, as records show water temperatures on the ship rose well above the safe threshold for the species.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has officially opened an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency that enforces rules limiting the political activities of federal employees. It remains unclear what actions could be taken against Smith, as he is no longer a government employee.</p>

          <p>Romania is taking significant steps to formally acknowledge the genocide of its Sinti and Roma populations during World War II, a topic long silenced in the country's public discourse. The new pro-European president, Nicusor Dan, recently participated in a memorial event, signaling a shift towards grappling with this dark chapter of national history. This change comes after years of pressure from civil society groups and is seen as a crucial move to combat ongoing racism and hate speech. The effort aims to ensure the victims are remembered and the history is properly taught.</p>

          <p>Ethereum is celebrating its tenth anniversary, marking a decade of evolution from a small, idealistic project into a foundational pillar of modern finance. Launched by Vitalik Buterin and a small team, the programmable blockchain has become the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on its infrastructure, integrating it into the global financial system. Despite challenges, Ethereum's stability and flexibility have established it as the dominant platform for on-chain innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man from Polk County, Tennessee, has been arrested after allegedly threatening to kill public officials and law enforcement officers. During the arrest at his home, deputies discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device, prompting an investigation by the ATF and a bomb squad. A subsequent search uncovered 14 explosive devices, and authorities believe the suspect attempted to detonate them as officers arrived. He now faces multiple charges, including nine counts of attempted first-degree murder against the officers present.</p>

          <p>The UK government has approved a 4.2% pay increase for police officers in England and Wales, an amount that the Police Federation has derided as 'barely treading water.' The federation, which represents over 145,000 officers, argued the raise is not enough to combat record resignations and declining living standards after years of real-terms pay cuts. While the Home Secretary framed the increase as a signal of gratitude, the federation contends it will do little to address the ongoing crisis in policing morale and retention.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 17% tariff on tomatoes imported from Mexico, ending a long-standing trade agreement. The move is strongly supported by some American tomato farmers, who claim the previous deal allowed Mexican producers to unfairly undercut U.S. prices. Farmers in states like Alabama report an immediate increase in business interest following the announcement. While the tariff is intended to bolster domestic food security and protect U.S. growers, there are concerns it could lead to higher tomato prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
