          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a frustrating 3-0 shutout loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, managing a meager three hits and only one runner in scoring position. This defeat halted their recent four-game winning streak and underscored persistent offensive challenges, especially against a pitcher like Zac Gallen who had been having a dismal season. Starting pitcher Blake Snell struggled with a noticeable drop in fastball velocity, conceding three runs including a crucial two-run home run. This outcome marked a significant missed opportunity for the Dodgers to expand their division lead, as both they and the San Diego Padres failed to capitalize on favorable schedules against lower-ranked opponents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants within the United States. Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration's policy likely infringes on individuals' due process rights, arguing that even those who entered illegally are entitled to a fair process under the Fifth Amendment. This decision is a significant setback for President Trump's campaign promise of increased deportations, although it does not question the constitutionality of expedited removal at the border. The ruling emphasizes the necessity of due process for a large group of people not previously subject to such fast-track removals.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks endured a heartbreaking 76-75 loss to the Indiana Fever at Crypto.com Arena, significantly hindering their pursuit of a playoff berth. The Sparks maintained control for the majority of the game, holding a narrow lead heading into the final minute. However, a critical offensive rebound by Aliyah Boston and a subsequent steal by Boston in the last seconds sealed their fate. Azurá Stevens led the Sparks with 17 points, while the Fever relied on strong performances from Boston and Odyssey Sims, with star Caitlin Clark sidelined. This defeat leaves the Sparks precariously in ninth place with only seven regular-season games remaining, two games behind the final playoff spot.</p>

          <p>A grand jury has indicted two civilian workers, John Floyd and Nelson Wu, on charges stemming from the 2021 Pearl Harbor fuel spill that contaminated drinking water, leading to illnesses in 6,000 people. The indictment specifically alleges that Floyd and Wu provided the Navy with inaccurate information regarding a May 2021 leak, six months prior to the drinking water contamination. They are accused of misleading officials about the volume of spilled fuel and redacting data, causing the Navy to underreport the incident to the Hawaii Department of Health. This marks the first indictment in the case, which a Navy investigation previously linked to significant management failures and human error, ultimately prompting the closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend, despite being ranked outside the top 100 in singles, achieved a stunning upset at the US Open, defeating No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2 to reach the fourth round. This career-highlight victory follows a controversial period where Townsend publicly addressed alleged "no class" comments from a previous opponent, Jelena Ostapenko, sparking accusations of racism. Townsend stated her stand was "bigger than me," focusing on representation and authenticity within the sport, and has garnered significant public support from figures like Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka. Her resilience is further underscored by past challenges, including a USTA fitness controversy in 2012, making this triumph a powerful statement.</p>

Additionally, hundreds of UN human rights agency employees have backed a letter urging the leadership to declare Israel's offensive in Gaza a genocide.

          <p>California and Texas are at the forefront of a nationwide political battle over congressional redistricting, a fight poised to significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas initiated the conflict by redrawing maps to create five new Republican-favoring seats, prompting California to retaliate by creating five new Democratic-leaning districts. This mid-decade gerrymandering, encouraged by President Trump to maintain Republican control of Congress, is now spreading to other states like Missouri. The article explains how redistricting, though typically done after a census, is being used to manipulate electoral outcomes, raising concerns about diluted minority voting power and the integrity of the democratic process.</p>

          <p>Charles Borges, the chief data officer for the Social Security Administration (SSA), has resigned, alleging "constructive discharge" after filing a whistleblower complaint. Borges claimed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees uploaded the entire country's Social Security information to a "vulnerable cloud environment." While an SSA spokesperson refuted the claim, stating the data was "walled off" and not compromised, Borges cited retaliation and a "culture of fear" making his duties impossible. This follows a Supreme Court decision allowing DOGE access to sensitive data, intensifying concerns over data security and whistleblower protections within federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery analyzed by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab shows the construction of an extensive earthen wall, or "berm," around the besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher. Over 31km of these barriers have been built by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since May, reportedly to trap people inside and deepen siege conditions. El Fasher is the last army stronghold in Darfur, and its fall could lead to national partitioning. The RSF is accused of intensifying attacks on civilians and hospitals, with humanitarian access blocked for months, leading to severe food and medical shortages for the 300,000 residents.</p>

          <p>Live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with 385 out of 439 fires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land directly attributed to manoeuvres. Fire crews battling blazes, such as a recent moorland fire in North Yorkshire, are frequently hindered by exploding World War II-era unexploded ordnance, making safe access impossible. Locals are urging the MoD to ban live fire training during dry months due to environmental and health concerns from smoke pollution. The MoD states it has robust wildfire policies and restricts live ammunition use during high-risk periods.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, upholding a lower court ruling. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to vacate a prior TPS extension, emphasizing that Congress designed the program to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This decision offers a significant win for plaintiffs, who argued the administration overstepped its bounds. While the ruling's immediate effect on those whose protections already expired is unclear, it provides a legal path to challenge the administration's actions.</p>

This measure seeks to increase Democratic representation and counter President Trump's agenda, following Texas's move to add Republican seats. Opponents, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and a bipartisan coalition, have booked over $10 million in airtime, arguing for the independent redistricting commission established in 2010. Supporters, spending at least $2 million initially, contend that Trump allies are trying to rig the 2026 election. The campaign underscores intense partisan efforts to influence federal power.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has cancelled $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding, citing an "AMERICA FIRST!" agenda. He informed House Speaker Mike Johnson of the withholding of funds for 15 international programs, employing a rarely used "pocket rescission" procedure to bypass Congress. This maneuver, last used in 1977, allows funds to expire without legislative approval if the request is made late in the fiscal year. Democrats and some Republicans, like Senator Susan Collins, have criticized the move as illegal and a violation of congressional authority. The action further strains legislative-executive relations and raises concerns about a potential government shutdown.</p>

CVS, for instance, cannot vaccinate even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico due to state laws.

Clinical guidelines recommend starting with behavioral intervention for this age group due to potential side effects like irritability and the high likelihood of treatment failure.
