          <p>Maryland officials conducted a profound reinterment ceremony for 65 early Catholic settlers at Historic St. Mary's City, more than 300 years after their original burials. This event, attended by the Archbishop of Baltimore, honored these individuals who established a precedent for religious liberty in North America, a fundamental aspect of the American experience. Researchers meticulously studied the remains, uncovering valuable insights into colonial life, including chronic illnesses and diet, with findings slated for a future publication. The ceremony aimed to restore dignity to these long-forgotten founders and underscore the enduring legacy of tolerance and coexistence they championed in the 1600s, positioning St. Mary's City alongside Jamestown and Plymouth in historical significance.</p>

          <p>US envoys, including Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, are traveling to Egypt for crucial ceasefire negotiations, following Hamas's conditional acceptance of key aspects of President Trump's peace proposal. Trump expressed strong optimism, stating "we are very close" to finalizing a deal that aims to end the two-year-old conflict, secure the release of all remaining hostages, and facilitate an exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties, even as Trump urged Israel to halt bombing. The complex proposal also includes Israel's phased withdrawal from Gaza and Hamas's eventual disarmament, though the latter remains a point of contention.</p>

          <p>Detective Devin Rigo urgently pursued a maroon minivan, identified as the primary crime scene in the murder of Kenneth Fandrich, to an Oregon scrapyard. Fandrich was found dead in an Intel parking garage, and surveillance footage implicated Dr. Steven Milner, who had previously stalked Fandrich, showing him spray-painting cameras and moving the victim into the vehicle. Investigators believed the minivan held vital forensic evidence to solidify their case against Milner. However, despite their rapid response, Detective Rigo arrived tragically too late, witnessing the crucial vehicle being crushed into scrap metal, a significant setback for the prosecution.</p>

Two unidentified drones were confirmed near the airport's runways before disappearing. Concurrently, Lithuania's main airport also temporarily suspended air traffic due to a "possible series of balloons." These events are the latest in a string of mysterious drone sightings across European Union member countries and critical infrastructure sites, sparking concerns among authorities, who suspect potential Russian involvement, though Russia denies these claims. European leaders are slated to discuss enhanced drone detection and defense strategies to address this escalating threat.</p>

          <p>The US electric vehicle (EV) market is projected to face a substantial slowdown following the expiration of a significant $7,500 government tax credit, despite a recent surge in sales attributed to buyers rushing to purchase before the incentive ended. Automakers like Ford and General Motors anticipate a "precipitous" drop in demand, with the US lagging considerably behind China and Europe in EV adoption. This disparity is linked to comparatively weaker government support and high tariffs on affordable Chinese EVs. The future trajectory of US EV sales now hinges critically on how carmakers adjust their pricing strategies amidst these dual pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's stated basis for the deployment, citing chaos, was "untethered to the facts" and that protests were not significantly violent enough to justify military intrusion without the governor's consent. This decision, which emphasizes the constitutional separation of civil and military power, was lauded by Oregon officials, who viewed it as a crucial win for state sovereignty and a rebuke to federal overreach, affirming local control over law enforcement matters.</p>

Elevated just four days before the game, Neuheisel devised an aggressive offensive strategy that saw quarterback Nico Iamaleava deliver a career-best performance, accounting for five touchdowns. This unexpected win, UCLA's first against a top-10 team since 2007, brought immense relief and jubilation, with fans chanting Neuheisel's name. Despite some initial communication glitches with the new system, the team's belief and bold approach led to a significant triumph.</p>

          <h2>Understanding "Freshers' Flu": Why New University Students Get Sick</h2>

          <p>Freshers' flu," a prevalent illness among new university students, is identified as a collection of common cold viruses, intensified by the unique environment of campus life. Immunologists explain that the convergence of thousands of students from diverse backgrounds creates a "mixing pot" of novel respiratory infections. Compounding this, factors such as late-night socializing, crowded lectures, communal living, poor dietary habits, and the stress of adapting to university life collectively suppress the immune system, rendering students highly susceptible. While typically not serious, experts recommend adequate rest and medical consultation for persistent symptoms, emphasizing the body's need for recovery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting a Trump administration initiative to transfer immigrant children into adult detention facilities upon their 18th birthdays, preventing scheduled transfers for the weekend. US District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that this automatic detention violates a previous 2021 court order mandating release to the "least restrictive setting" for eligible individuals. This legal challenge underscores ongoing controversies surrounding Trump's immigration policies, which also face accusations of reviving family separations and offering financial incentives for children to self-deport, practices criticized for coercing vulnerable individuals and undermining their legal claims.</p>

She now faces the significant task of restoring voter trust following recent party scandals and navigating the complexities of a rising far-right.

          <p>The United States' growing disengagement from the United Nations, an institution it largely shaped and financially supports, is increasingly viewed as presenting a "tremendous opportunity" for other global powers, particularly China. Former German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock highlighted a collective will among nations to "choose the right path at the crossroads" for the UN, which she noted remains adrift decades after similar calls for reform. This American retreat from multilateralism could enable countries like China to expand their influence and leadership roles, potentially leading to a significant reshaping of international diplomacy and the balance of power within the global body.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis converged on Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, expressing cautious optimism and celebrating the potential Gaza ceasefire deal, with many crediting President Trump for his perceived role in brokering the agreement. Protesters, some wearing Trump masks, voiced criticism towards Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of prioritizing political gain over securing the hostages' immediate release. The proposed 20-point plan outlines a hostage-for-prisoner exchange and a phased Israeli withdrawal. Despite Netanyahu's public statements about achieving a "great achievement" and maintaining control in Gaza, the demonstrators' primary message was a fervent desire for the return of all hostages and a return to normalcy.</p>
