          <p>In Costa Rica, police seized crack cocaine, marijuana, knives, and five capybaras, which are the world's largest rodents, after a car chase. The two men in the vehicle, who both had criminal records, were arrested and the Security Minister noted the intersection of the drug world with the introduction of non-native species. The capybaras, which are illegal to possess, transport, or traffic in Costa Rica, were turned over to the National System of Conservation Areas to be evaluated by veterinarians and then transferred to a refuge for environmental and conservation education programs. This incident marks the first recorded case of illegal capybara trafficking in Costa Rica.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that his upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in June will be a crucial step toward resolving bilateral tariff negotiations. Ishiba emphasized that Japan seeks the complete removal of higher U.S. tariffs rather than settling for a reduction. He also addressed rising rice prices in Japan due to a poor harvest, promising to lower them sharply to satisfy both producers and consumers. Shinjiro Koizumi, the agriculture minister, announced the release of stockpiled rice directly to supermarkets to reduce prices, addressing public concerns about inflation and sluggish wage growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by showing indifference to harassment of Jewish students since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights alleges that Columbia failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism and did not properly investigate or punish vandalism. This action follows previous measures by the Trump administration against universities, including barring Harvard University from enrolling international students. The government claims Columbia failed to abide by its own policies and procedures when responding to Jewish students' complaints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering a 5% tax on remittance transfers from the U.S., primarily impacting Latin American countries that rely heavily on these funds. The proposal, aimed at curbing illegal migration, has drawn criticism from leaders like Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, who argues it amounts to double taxation. Experts warn the tax could push transfers into informal channels and disproportionately affect countries where remittances constitute a significant portion of GDP. The policy also raises concerns about alienating Latino voters, who represent a growing demographic in U.S. elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by revoking its eligibility to enroll international students, potentially affecting over 6,000 students. This move, likely to face legal challenges, adds uncertainty for international students already grappling with visa revocations and bureaucratic hurdles. Education advocates denounce the action as an overreach that will harm US higher education by deterring global talent. Universities fear a significant drop in foreign student enrollment, impacting their finances and contributions to various fields, as international students contribute billions to the US economy and foster innovation.</p>

The price cap, which affects 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales, will see its first drop in a year, reflecting a fall in wholesale gas prices.

States and cities enacted new policies such as banning chokeholds and mandating body cameras, but these changes have had little impact on accountability or the number of police killings. The Trump administration has dropped efforts to investigate or oversee nearly two dozen police departments, and the number of prosecutions for police shootings has remained relatively unchanged.

          <p>Hundreds of workers remained underground at the Kloof gold mine near Johannesburg after a "shaft incident," according to mining company Sibanye Stillwater. All 260 employees have been accounted for and provided with food, and the company stated that the workers were not trapped. Initial investigations showed that a rock winder skip door opened at the loading point, causing some damage. The company expects all affected employees to be brought to the surface later today, after safety and shaft examination procedures are completed.</p>

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems insufficient to reverse historical pay freezes. The BMA plans to ballot members next week over possible strike action, arguing that doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago. The government defends the offer as above inflation, but unions express concerns that it will not be fully funded, potentially leading to cuts in services. The Royal College of Nursing also reacted angrily to a smaller rise for nurses and other NHS staff, raising the possibility of industrial action.</p>

          <p>A sweeping tax bill passed by House Republicans disproportionately benefits wealthy Americans through tax cuts for businesses, investors, and homeowners, while low-income households face reduced social safety net programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bottom tenth of households will see a 2% income drop in 2027, while the top 10% will gain 4%. Reductions to Medicaid and SNAP offset the tax cuts, impacting lower-income individuals who rely on these programs. Economists criticize the bill's regressive nature, compounded by the administration's recent tariff policies.</p>
