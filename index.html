          <p>The article addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the 'one country, two systems' framework is set to expire. It references a presentation by activist investor David Webb, who questioned the applicability of existing laws post-2047 and suggested the need for law students to familiarize themselves with mainland law. The author urges calm and recalls similar anxieties leading up to 1997, emphasizing the need to address the issue of land leases and borrowing for property purchases to ensure stability and confidence in Hong Kong's future. The author hopes to avoid a repeat of past alarmism by proactively discussing legal and economic implications.</p>

          <p>Poland began voting in a high-stakes presidential election that will significantly influence the country's political direction, particularly concerning abortion rights, LGBTQ+ protections, and its relationship with the European Union. The leading candidates are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, a pro-EU Warsaw mayor supported by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, and Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian backed by the conservative Law and Justice party. Trzaskowski champions abortion rights and LGBTQ+ protections, while Nawrocki emphasizes conservative values and national sovereignty. The outcome will determine whether the current political gridlock between the prime minister and the outgoing conservative president eases or intensifies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences found that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor consistent right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the study also identified problematic chauvinist and xenophobic views among some soldiers. While the findings offer some relief amidst past reports of far-right networks within the military, researchers remain skeptical about the effectiveness of voluntary surveys and the timing of the study, which coincided with increased scrutiny of right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr and police. Some experts argue that the military needs to do more to address the complexity of modern right-wing mindsets, especially given the rise of far-right attitudes in broader society.</p>

          <p>In the retrial of Karen Read, accused of murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, a Massachusetts judge barred references to a separate, mishandled murder investigation. This decision comes as defense attorneys aim to portray the investigation into O'Keefe's death as unreliable and potentially corrupt. An expert in criminal justice highlighted significant errors in the initial police response, emphasizing the need for improved training and documentation to avoid compromising cases. The retrial continues with scrutiny on evidence handling and investigative procedures, raising questions about the integrity of the process.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 02:24:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed delaying the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charging current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027, citing budget deficits. These changes aim to address a $12 billion state budget shortfall, attributed to factors including tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, rising medication costs, and increased healthcare utilization among seniors. While Newsom stated he would not remove anyone from Medi-Cal, the measures are intended to ensure fiscal stability and preserve the program's long-term viability for all Californians.</p>

He argues that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment is "theft, thievery on a high scale" and will harm young artists. This comes after the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to ensure copyright holders have to give permission for their work to be used.
