          <h2>Treasury Secretary Bessent Highlights Potential for Trade Deal with China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 11:05:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the US and China have an opportunity to reach a significant trade agreement, advocating for a collaborative rebalancing of trade relations. Bessent criticized the World Bank's lending practices to economically advanced nations like China, suggesting a shift in resource allocation towards higher priority areas and private sector-led growth. He emphasized the need for the IMF and World Bank to reform and serve their stakeholders effectively, urging China to embrace its role in the global economy and graduate from its 'developing country' status. Bessent's remarks signal a potential shift in the Trump administration's approach to trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>
