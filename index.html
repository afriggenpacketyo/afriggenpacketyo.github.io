          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral race, citing constant media speculation and a Campaign Finance Board decision to withhold millions in funds. His departure creates a dynamic three-way contest between Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa. Adams faced a tumultuous year, including a federal corruption scandal, which he claims was politically motivated. Other candidates reacted, with Mamdani linking Adams' actions to Donald Trump, while Cuomo thanked Adams for his leadership and acknowledged his accomplishments. City leaders, including Governor Kathy Hochul, also recognized Adams' contributions in areas like housing, crime reduction, and the city's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, marking a significant shift in the city's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a prototype Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) air defense system to South Korea, marking the first known overseas deployment of such a system. This strategic move, featuring a mobile, ground-based weapon designed to intercept cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and rockets, is perceived as a direct response to potential threats from China and North Korea. The IFPC system aims to significantly enhance South Korea's air and missile defense capabilities, bolstering regional security in a volatile geopolitical environment. This article highlights the ongoing efforts by the US to strengthen its alliances and advanced military technology in key global hotspots, underscoring a commitment to deterrence and stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>The increasing vacancy rates in American shopping centers are leading to more favorable real estate deals for small, local businesses across the country. Wellness practitioners, artists, and service-based businesses are now securing prime commercial spaces once dominated by national chains, often with flexible lease terms, partial fit-outs, and even rent-free periods. While overall rental rates are still rising, the slower pace of increase and higher availability are creating an opening for entrepreneurs. This trend allows local businesses to test physical presence without overextending capital, contributing to community regeneration and filling spaces left by larger brands. Experts note that landlords are increasingly willing to negotiate to keep plazas active and bustling, as empty spaces deter consumers, fostering a more flexible and opportunity-rich environment for independent retailers.</p>

          <p>A devastating incident at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, resulted in at least four fatalities and eight injuries during a Sunday morning worship service. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Marine Corps veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle into the church, opened fire on hundreds of congregants, and deliberately set the building ablaze before being killed in a shootout with police. The FBI is investigating the event as an act of targeted violence, and authorities are responding to additional bomb threats in the community. Officials, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer, expressed heartbreak and gratitude for first responders, while the church emphasized faith and peace amidst the tragedy. Law enforcement agencies, including the NYPD and LAPD, are increasing patrols at places of worship as a precaution.</p>

          <p>The Village of Broadview has launched a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter's vehicle was hit by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent. The incident occurred while reporter Asal Rezaei was alone near an ICE detention facility, with no active protests taking place, and her driver's side window down. The projectile caused chemical agents to engulf her truck, leaving white powder on her windshield and causing her face to burn and her to vomit. Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills condemned the "unprovoked attack" and stated the department expects full cooperation from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security into their criminal investigation, highlighting concerns about press freedom and potential excessive force.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, with the CSI 300 index climbing about 16% and the IT index reaching its highest level since 2015. This surge is largely driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, efforts towards chip self-sufficiency, and Beijing's campaign to rein in price wars, fueling investor optimism. Retail investors, who dominate China's onshore markets, have played a key role by shifting bank deposits into equities. While some experts caution about a potential bubble, particularly in technology and contract research organizations, others note that the overall market doesn't show signs of overheating. This article highlights that underlying economic fundamentals do not fully support the current momentum, raising questions about the rally's sustainability and potential vulnerabilities.

China Southern Airlines reported "financially leased" a total of just three jets as of June, with no mention of ownership. This article suggests that the Shanghai-based manufacturer, Comac, might be experiencing turbulence in securing engines for the model, leading to market speculation regarding potential disruptions to the supply chain.

          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are expected to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation event in U.S. history, as part of the Trump administration's program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. This significant exodus comes as Congress faces a deadline to authorize more funding or risk a government shutdown, with the White House also ordering federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings. Workers described months of "fear and intimidation" that left them feeling they had no choice but to depart, citing that when their mission is undermined, job security is uncertain, and work-life balance is stripped away, they choose to leave.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong's Green Marine Fuel Ambitions Hinge on Methanol Supply Chain Development</h2>

          <p>Hong Kong's ambitious goals for green marine fuels are heavily reliant on establishing a robust methanol supply chain, according to Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While the city has already realized liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel fueling operations with significant throughput, green methanol requires a reliable upstream-to-downstream infrastructure. This includes bringing mainland-produced fuel into Hong Kong, storing it, and selling it tax-free. This article notes the maiden voyage of the ship CM Hong Kong, a dual-fuel vehicle carrier, which currently uses one-quarter green methanol despite its cost being around four times more than traditional fuel. Europe's implementation of carbon emissions-based import tariffs is expected to accelerate methanol usage from 2027, highlighting the urgency for Hong Kong to develop its supply capabilities.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed severe negligence at a specialist eating disorder unit in York, where staff were photographed sleeping while on duty, failing to monitor vulnerable patients at risk of self-harm. Whistleblowers and nine former inpatients reported multiple "unsafe" incidents, including staff witnessing self-harm without intervention, unhygienic food, and the use of triggering language, with many patients feeling their condition worsened. The Care Quality Commission, which previously rated the service "good," is now conducting further monitoring and inspections. The unit has since closed due to low referrals, and a co-located dementia unit also faced a temporary suspension of new admissions over safety concerns, underscoring systemic issues in patient care and oversight. This article highlights the profound impact of such failings on seriously ill individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, despite two federal courts having universally blocked it on different grounds. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government has a compelling interest in ensuring American citizenship is granted only to those "lawfully entitled to it," claiming the lower court decisions undermine border security. This article notes that courts and the government have historically interpreted the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause to apply to all born in the U.S., regardless of parents' immigration status, a precedent established in 1898. Critics, like the ACLU, call the order illegal and a "cruel and senseless" attempt to strip citizenship, warning of an "earthquake" if the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favor.</p>

Officials stated Jahn used apps designed to track ICE agents as part of his planning, highlighting a concerning aspect of the incident. Marcos Charles, an ICE executive, blamed "wild rhetoric" for what he described as a 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE officers, underscoring a climate of extreme animosity towards law enforcement.

Additionally, the Daily Mirror highlights Labour's proposal for sanctions against long-term youth unemployed individuals who refuse paid work placements.

          <p>President Trump stated his confidence that the American people will side with him if a government shutdown occurs, blaming Democrats for the impasse ahead of a crucial meeting with congressional leaders. He believes Democrats will pay a political price for not agreeing to his terms for spending cuts, particularly regarding undocumented migrants accessing public benefits, which he linked to healthcare negotiations. The White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs if funding expires. Democrats, however, assert that current federal law prohibits taxpayer dollars for undocumented immigrants' healthcare and are fighting to protect Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies.

          <p>The UK Labour Party is struggling to maintain the trust of the business community, which had largely supported them before the election, following a post-election budget that introduced significant negative components for businesses. Billionaire John Caudwell, a long-time Conservative supporter who switched to backing Labour, noted a "desperate loss of faith" due to increases in employers' National Insurance and an inflation-busting hike in the National Living Wage. While the government highlights substantial inward investment from tech giants like Apple and Nvidia, smaller businesses feel forgotten, citing rising costs and a reluctance to invest or hire new staff.
