          <p>China's next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft has successfully completed its inaugural test flight, which included a critical zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. Developed for China's lunar ambitions in 2030, the Mengzhou spacecraft comes in two variants: one for near-Earth space station operations with a seven-astronaut capacity, and another for deep-space lunar missions. During the test, the spacecraft's escape engines ignited while grounded, and the return capsule reached its designated altitude and separated cleanly before landing safely with an airbag cushioning system. This safety verification simulates emergency scenarios during liftoff, ensuring crew survival in case of rocket failures, and marks China's first such test since 1998. </p>

          <p>Honda has announced the successful test of its experimental reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, Japan. The company stated that the rocket reached an altitude of nearly 300 meters before successfully landing, marking a significant achievement for the carmaker. Honda aims to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029, utilizing technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems. While no decisions have been made regarding commercialization, Honda sees potential for contributing to daily life through satellite launches, leading to services compatible with other Honda businesses, as growing expectations for space-based data systems increase demand for satellite launch rockets.</p>

The grocery chain stated it has not fully recovered from the attack that occurred last month. While the offer aims to show that the Co-op is "on the front foot" ahead of summer trading, one analyst suggests it is an effort to win back customers who may have started shopping elsewhere.

          <p>Urawa Reds were defeated by River Plate 3-1 in their opening match of the Club World Cup, conceding all goals through headers. Despite strong support, Urawa's defensive lapses proved costly, with River Plate taking an early lead and maintaining it throughout the game. Although Urawa managed to score a penalty, they struggled to contain River's attacks and ultimately faced an uphill battle to advance in the tournament. The match was decided by small details, and Urawa found things really tough at the start, but the positive was that they gradually found their pace and looked to dominate.</p>

          <p>The debate over whether the US should join Israel in attacking Iran has revealed divisions among Donald Trump's supporters. Trump's reported consideration of targeting Iranian nuclear facilities has pitted the isolationist and hawkish wings of his party against each other. Conservative Republican congressman Thomas Massie has sided with Democrats to block Trump from engaging US forces in unauthorized hostilities, while figures like Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene have opposed intervention. Steve Bannon has argued that a war with Iran would "blow up" the coalition of Trump supporters.</p>
