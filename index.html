            <p>Malaysian durian exports to China have increased significantly due to a growing consumer preference for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen on the tree before being collected, a method favored by Chinese consumers. Improved logistics and a steady supply have enabled Malaysian suppliers to increase exports by 30% this year. This surge presents significant opportunities for Malaysian durian growers to expand their market share in China.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is facing a growing number of espionage cases, revealing vulnerabilities in the island's political and military defenses. Several individuals closely associated with senior DPP politicians are under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence. This infiltration raises concerns about Beijing's intensifying efforts to undermine Taiwan from within, potentially impacting public trust in the government.

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight. Putin stated that Russia would cease fighting, expecting Ukraine to reciprocate, while remaining prepared to respond to any violations or provocations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism but said Ukraine would mirror a full and unconditional ceasefire if Russia genuinely observed it. The announcement follows increasing pressure from the Trump administration for progress in peace talks, and a prior rejection by Putin of a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.</p>
