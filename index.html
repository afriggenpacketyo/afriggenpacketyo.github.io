          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk alleges that Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to achieve top rankings, specifically questioning why his xAI's Grok chatbot is not featured more prominently. This follows Musk's previous criticism of Apple's integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the operating system level, which he labeled an "unacceptable security violation." The threat comes as Musk's xAI and OpenAI are in direct competition with new AI models.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the recent firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, whom Trump accused of manipulating jobs data after a weaker-than-expected July report. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been publicly supported by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. The move has raised concerns among some economists about the potential politicization of the independent federal statistical agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to manage the intense competition in China's "quick commerce" sector. He argues that instead of stifling competition, regulators should curb excessive cash burn and guide the industry towards high-quality, innovative development. This approach aims to transform the sector from a zero-sum game into a win-win scenario that creates new consumption opportunities. The advice comes as e-commerce platforms are fiercely competing in the rapid delivery market for food and essential goods. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite abandoning their final stolen vehicle and leaving behind a loaded firearm, the suspects managed to evade capture, and authorities believe others may have assisted their escape.</p>

          <p>According to newly declassified FBI documents, a Democratic whistleblower who worked for the House Intelligence Committee for over a decade has accused Rep. Adam Schiff of approving the leak of classified information. The staffer reportedly told the FBI that Schiff greenlit the leaks in 2017 with the intention of discrediting then-President Donald Trump and pursuing his indictment. The whistleblower described the alleged actions as "treasonous" and "illegal." The documents were recently provided to Congress by FBI Director Kash Patel, prompting calls for further investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, suspending planned tariff hikes that were set to take effect. President Trump signed an executive order to formalize the delay, meaning the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the U.S. calls unfair trade practices. The move averts, for now, a further escalation of trade tensions.

This climate of fear is expected to drastically reduce the city's sales tax revenue, impacting its ability to provide community services.

The U.S. government will allow the companies to sell certain chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue from those sales, which will go to the U.S. Treasury.

          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force is rooted in a narrative of rampant lawlessness that contradicts current crime statistics. While the president referenced a 2023 spike in homicides, he omitted that violent crime in the city is now at a 30-year low, with significant year-over-year decreases in homicides, robberies, and carjackings. Experts note this strategy mirrors his previous actions in Los Angeles, using false or misleading claims about crime and homelessness to justify federal intervention. Critics argue the move is a political maneuver rather than a data-driven response.</p>

          <p>Whistleblowers at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse. In a complaint to the Charity Commission, staff raised alarms about a "toxic internal culture," misuse of public funds, and a potential withdrawal of government funding. The concerns follow a threat from Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to pull funding unless the institute pivots its focus to defense and national security research. This has triggered what staff call a "crisis in governance" at the prominent, publicly funded research charity.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea footballer Jess Carter has spoken about the "astronomical" racist abuse she feared her Black teammate, Lauren James, would have faced if she were the only player to miss a penalty in a crucial Euro 2025 shootout. Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, described feeling a sense of relief when white teammates also missed penalties, highlighting the disproportionate burden on Black players. She revealed that the abuse made her feel "small" and "scared to play," shedding light on the severe psychological impact of racism.</p>

          <p>The three-year-old mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons has been solved after the killer's new girlfriend led police to his body. Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later contacted the police. The victim's family expressed immense gratitude for her actions, stating that without her intervention, Parsons' body likely would never have been found.</p>

          <p>President Trump is framing his upcoming bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska as a low-stakes "feel out" meeting, confirming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will not be included. Trump has indicated that "land swapping" will be a central theme of any potential deal to end the war, a concept Zelenskyy has rejected. In his remarks, Trump positioned himself as a pragmatic mediator, while a gaffe in which he said he was "going to Russia" revealed how central Putin is to his political narrative. The exclusion of Ukraine suggests a lack of genuine peace negotiation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting at the White House, just days after demanding his immediate resignation. The initial call for resignation followed questions raised by Senator Tom Cotton about Tan's past ties to China. After the meeting, which included cabinet members, Trump announced that Tan and his team would be bringing forward suggestions on strengthening U.S. technology. This sudden reversal reflects the administration's hands-on and often unpredictable approach to the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The project, proposed by a New York-based developer, is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for construction, and experts note that the current financial climate presents significant challenges for new housing development. High interest rates, rising material costs, and labor instability are creating uncertainty for developers, despite high demand for housing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta fired more than 180 rounds into the campus, breaking approximately 150 windows. The attacker, who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his mental health issues, killed a police officer before being stopped by security. Internal agency communications revealed that bullets pierced "blast-resistant" windows in multiple buildings, including the one housing the director's office. The extensive damage and motive have raised concerns about the impact of anti-science rhetoric on public servants.</p>
