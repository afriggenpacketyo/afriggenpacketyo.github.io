          <p>An attempted cyber attack on Edinburgh Council's education department disrupted pupils' revision ahead of key exams, leading to password resets for all users across the education service. Staff identified a suspicious meeting invitation as a spear-phishing attempt and took immediate precautionary measures. While the council assures that no data was compromised and students sitting exams will receive priority support, the incident caused considerable disruption as students were temporarily unable to access school learning resources. The council provided alternative arrangements for students to access their revision materials by visiting their school on Saturday to obtain a new password.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, resulting in numerous flight delays and cancellations. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed that a telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display for approximately 90 seconds. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, including upgrades to telecommunications systems and radar, but these improvements could take up to four years to complete. United Airlines has been limiting flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing issues, causing frustration for travelers and prompting officials to call for immediate action to fix the connection between New York air space and the Philadelphia air traffic control center.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a former commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, was fired by President Trump and plans to challenge the dismissal in court, arguing it is illegal. Trumka stated that he was given no reason for his firing, but it followed his vote against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. He expressed concern that DOGE would undermine the agency's lifesaving functions to benefit wealthy donors. Several Democratic senators and Consumer Reports have also condemned the firings, calling them an attack on the independence of the country's product safety watchdog.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle undocumented immigrants, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller argued that the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus during an invasion, framing illegal immigration as such. This consideration comes amid multiple lawsuits against the administration's handling of undocumented immigrants and criticisms of federal courts hindering the deportation process. The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only a few times in U.S. history, primarily during times of war or rebellion.</p>

          <p>The failure to secure murder convictions for officers involved in the beating death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis highlights the challenges in achieving meaningful police reform. Despite video evidence and the police chief's swift action to fire the officers, a jury acquitted three of the former officers involved in Nicholsâ€™s death on several charges, including second-degree murder. The verdict underscores the rarity of convictions against officers and the stalling of broader reform efforts due to changing political winds and rising violent crime. The article suggests that without systemic reforms and accountability, unjust deaths at the hands of law enforcement will continue.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exports Plunge Amid Increased U.S. Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Shipments decreased by 21% compared to the previous year, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, reflecting a shift in trade patterns. While President Trump suggested potentially lowering tariffs to 80%, this rate would still be prohibitively expensive for many U.S. businesses. The disruption in trade flows has prompted retailers to rethink their supply chains and reduce reliance on China.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new trade agreement with the U.K. has been met with skepticism, with experts suggesting that high tariffs are likely to remain in place long-term. Despite some concessions, a 10% tariff remains on U.K. imports, higher than the pre-Trump effective tariff rate. Economists warn that even with lower tariffs, businesses will continue to pay more for imported goods, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers and a slowdown in economic activity. The deal, while a "modest improvement," is considered worse than the pre-Trump status quo.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Zambia, Michael Gonzales, tearfully announced the cut of $50 million in aid for medications and medical supplies after discovering widespread theft of donated drugs. Gonzales' team found that 95% of pharmacies were selling stolen medications, with 45% being U.S.-provided drugs. Frustrated by the Zambian government's lack of action, Gonzales felt compelled to cut the aid to safeguard American taxpayer dollars. The decision has sparked mixed reactions in Zambia, with some praising the U.S. for exposing corruption and others fearing the health crisis that may result from the funding cut.</p>

While South Africa will not block departures, it has sought assurances that those selected have been fully vetted.
