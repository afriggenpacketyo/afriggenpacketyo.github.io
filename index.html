        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles, a group of federal ICE agents were denied entry to Dodger Stadium. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization confirmed the denial via social media, stating that the agents requested access to the parking lots but were turned away, and the Department of Homeland Security stated that CBP vehicles were briefly in the parking lot for reasons unrelated to any operation. The incident follows criticism of the Dodgers for not addressing immigration raids in the city, with President Trump instructing ICE to expand deportation efforts in major cities. The Los Angeles Police Department alerted the Dodgers to the ICE presence, leading to the denial of entry, and the situation unfolded against a backdrop of demonstrations and heightened tensions over immigration enforcement. The author's tone throughout the article reflects the seriousness of the situation and its potential implications for community relations, with the author not making any direct reference to the optimism score.</p>

          <p>A preliminary NTSB report reveals that a May plane crash that killed six people, including drummer Daniel Williams and music executive Dave Shapiro, was caused by the plane flying too low during its descent. Contributing factors included faulty runway lights and potentially adverse weather conditions near San Diego, California. The pilot, who had approval to fly the Cessna S550, discussed alternate airport weather conditions but did not notify air traffic control of his final selection. The aircraft struck power transmission lines before crashing into a residential area, damaging multiple vehicles and a structure, and the plane was not equipped with a flight data recorder.

          <p>A review of “28 Years Later,” the latest zombie film from Alex Garland and Danny Boyle, highlights its unusual ambition and quirky characters despite a dull central plot. The film blends philosophy, violence, pathos, and comedy, resulting in a tonally ungainly but kooky spectacle. The plot involves survivors nearly three decades into a viral pandemic, and the film's editing incorporates archival footage and abrasive sound to make points about human nature and struggle. The review concludes that the film doesn't reveal everything it's after but is an intriguing comment on human progress, and the author's tone throughout the article reflects the seriousness of the situation and its potential implications for community relations, with the author not making any direct reference to the optimism score.</p>
