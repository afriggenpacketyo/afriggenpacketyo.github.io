          <p>Long-sought Mexican cartel leader Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, 75, pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn courtroom to U.S. drug trafficking charges, expressing remorse for his role in flooding the U.S. with illicit substances and fueling deadly violence in Mexico. Prosecutors assert that under his leadership, the Sinaloa cartel evolved into the world's largest drug trafficking organization, responsible for transporting at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine. Zambada admitted to bribing Mexican police and military commanders for operational freedom, and is now set to receive a life sentence on January 13, facing billions in financial penalties. This plea follows his arrest in Texas last year, ending a decades-long pursuit by U.S. law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has admitted that the main screening tool, Dash, used to assess domestic abuse victims' risk in the UK "doesn't work," despite being widely used by police, social services, and healthcare workers since 2009. Concerns are mounting from academics and sector professionals that Dash fails to accurately identify high-risk victims, with one analysis showing only 20% of domestic homicide victims were classified as high risk by the tool. Phillips is reviewing the entire victim support system, acknowledging "obvious problems" but emphasizing the need to make the best of the current system until a replacement is found. Families of victims are now exploring legal action against institutions they believe failed their loved ones due to inadequate assessments.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dominant 7-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, propelling them back into sole possession of first place in the National League West with just 30 games left in the regular season. Andy Pages was a standout, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs, while pitcher Emmet Sheehan delivered a career-high seven scoreless innings, limiting the Reds to just two hits and striking out ten. This impressive win, the team's fourth shutout in recent games, signals a positive trend as the Dodgers welcome back several key players from injury. Their strong performance suggests they will be a formidable contender as they push for more postseason success.</p>

Starting as a deckhand, he is now a superyacht captain, earning $10,000 monthly plus tips, significantly more than his initial yachting salary and comparable to his engineering income but with far fewer expenses. Ortega emphasizes that aspiring yachties need a willingness to learn and a customer service personality, not necessarily boating experience, and he now mentors others through his "Superyacht Sunday School" program. While acknowledging challenges like time away from family, he advocates for pursuing a fulfilling life over being stuck in an unhappy career.</p>

This significant increase fuels public excitement, with the estimated cash value for a single winner now at $367.9 million, offering the choice of a lump sum or 30 escalating annual payments. The absence of a jackpot winner since May 31 has contributed to this substantial prize, attracting more players across the 45 participating states. Despite the long odds of 1 in 292.2 million, the dream of winning continues to drive ticket sales.</p>

          <p>Approximately 10 million YouTube TV subscribers face the potential loss of Fox News, Fox Business, and Fox Corp. sports channels due to an unresolved fee dispute between Google-owned YouTube TV and Fox. The blackout could occur as early as Wednesday afternoon, threatening access to crucial college football games and the upcoming NFL season, which begins on September 7. YouTube TV asserts that Fox is demanding payments "far higher" than comparable content providers, aiming to avoid passing additional costs to subscribers. Conversely, Fox accuses Google of exploiting its influence by proposing "out of step" terms, emphasizing the need for a fair agreement. This conflict underscores the increasing frequency of such disputes in the evolving pay-TV landscape.</p>

          <p>California Republicans have filed an emergency petition with the state Supreme Court, seeking to block a November special election on Governor Gavin Newsom's controversial redistricting plan, Proposition 50. This measure, signed into law last week, aims to redraw congressional maps to make five GOP-held districts more favorable to Democrats, a move Newsom frames as a counter to Republican redistricting in Texas. Opponents argue the plan violates the state constitution by undermining the independent redistricting commission, bypassing a mandatory 30-day public review period, and violating the single-subject rule for ballot initiatives. This legal challenge represents a significant effort to halt a plan that could potentially help Democrats reclaim control of the U.S. House in 2026.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have announced a significant breakthrough in "invisibility" technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, traditionally vulnerable due to their powerful radar emissions. The new method, based on frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, makes AEW&C signals exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. By assigning each antenna a minutely varied frequency, the signal becomes chaotic at a distance, obscuring its directional origin and making the aircraft appear to "fluctuate, scatter, and morph beyond recognition" to adversaries. This innovation represents a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability and effectiveness of these critical command nodes in future conflicts.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has controversially labeled illegal immigration a "scourge" affecting the UK on a "historic and unprecedented" scale, outlining strict plans to detain and deport people entering the country illegally. His party proposes introducing a legal obligation on the Home Secretary to remove illegal arrivals and to ban anyone entering illegally from ever being able to claim asylum. To facilitate these sweeping removals, Reform UK plans to leave the European Court of Human Rights, repeal the Human Rights Act, and disapply international treaties like the Refugee Convention. Farage's assertive stance comes amidst heightened political debate, with nearly 28,000 migrants having crossed the English Channel since the start of the year.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Dauphin Island, Alabama, a barrier island, is facing an existential crisis as it continues to shrink due to storms and sea-level rise. Katrina severed the island's west end, destroying over 300 homes, with some residents still paying property taxes on lots now submerged under Gulf waters. Mayor Jeff Collier highlights the critical need for continuous maintenance and millions in funding for beach restoration projects, including a $60 million plan for the west end. The recent cancellation of FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program, which supported such projects, by the Trump administration further complicates efforts, leaving communities like Dauphin Island in limbo.</p>

The ongoing manhunt focuses on rugged, heavily forested terrain outside Leavenworth, described as extremely challenging due to steep hillsides, dense brush, and minimal cell service. DNA testing earlier this month confirmed Decker, a former Army soldier, as the sole suspect after he failed to return his daughters to their mother following a planned visitation. With nearly 100 personnel, including special agents and experts, authorities are committed to finding Decker and delivering justice for 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn, and 5-year-old Olivia, offering a $20,000 reward for information.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump expressed a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, possibly this year, aiming to revive past nuclear diplomacy during an "occasionally awkward" Oval Office meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. Trump, who has met Kim three times previously, praised their relationship and claimed fewer missile tests since his return to office, a point disputed by analysts. During the meeting, Trump also floated the idea of the U.S. taking ownership of land hosting a military base in South Korea, rather than leasing it, an idea likely to provoke strong reactions. Despite Lee's flattery and calls for Trump to be a "peacemaker," concrete agreements on trade and defense issues remained unresolved.</p>

While a White House spokesperson had indicated a review found funds "grossly misused to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda," California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the agreement, asserting that the lawsuit compelled the administration to back down.
