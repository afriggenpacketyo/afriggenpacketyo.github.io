          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported that President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum was not raised during recent talks with U.S. officials in Washington. Trump announced the tariff increase on social media, citing national security, and the new rate is set to take effect on Wednesday. Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to discuss the outcome of the talks and was instructed to continue negotiations with the U.S. with the goal of reaching an agreement. The Japanese government is closely monitoring the specific details of the measures to be revealed by the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has identified Yunnan province as a key origin point for the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies a long-speculated hypothesis about the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. Scientists analyzed genetic data and found that a portion of the Tibetan Plateau population's genetic makeup originates from an archaeological site in central Yunnan. This discovery fills a crucial gap in understanding the prehistoric populations of East and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the current crisis in American air travel, using Newark Liberty International Airport as a prime example. Newark has experienced multiple frightening incidents due to failing radio and radar systems, which have left air traffic controllers overworked and understaffed. An aviation safety writer for The Verge, Darryl Campbell, explains that the problems at Newark are systemic and reflect issues that many airports will face in the coming years. The FAA's budget struggles to keep up with maintenance needs, leading to outdated systems and overworked staff. </p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in the upcoming Spending Review, which will outline departmental budgets for the next few years. The level of NHS spending will largely dictate whether cuts are made to other unprotected areas like schools and criminal justice. The IFS suggests that the government "front-loaded" spending, meaning spending will slow down, and increasing health funding could lead to real-terms cuts in other departments. The government insists it will scrutinize every pound spent.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the need to fight for a new social contract that lifts from the bottom of society, drawing lessons from past poor people's movements. It highlights the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), led by poor Black women. The NWRO championed "welfare as a right" and demanded a "guaranteed adequate income," challenging the notion that a person's value is tied to their ability to work. The article suggests that the Johnnie Tillmon model of grassroots organizing can transform growing indignation into lasting power.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the risk of sun damage during air travel, particularly for those in window seats. While airplane windows block most UVB rays, they don't fully block UVA rays, which can cause premature aging and skin cancer. Dermatologists recommend wearing sunscreen on flights, especially for frequent flyers or those with a history of skin cancer. Protective clothing and sunglasses are also helpful in reducing ultraviolet exposure.</p>

          <p>Armed clans are reasserting themselves in the Gaza Strip, challenging Hamas's authority, particularly in areas where the IDF is conducting operations. These clans act like armed militias, seizing food, looting warehouses, and protecting their members from Hamas security forces. The influence of these clans predates the current conflict, rooted in smuggling networks. Hamas has accused some clans of collaborating with Israel, while security sources say the clans are motivated by power and wealth rather than ideology.</p>

          <p>Doctorsâ€™ associations and medical schools warn that a proposal in the Republican-led budget bill, which restricts graduate federal student loans, could worsen a national shortage of doctors. The proposal would limit federal student loans for "professional programs" to $150,000 and eliminate a federal graduate loan program. Advocates warn this could drive low-income students away from medicine, make loans harder to repay, and worsen the flight of doctors from lower-paid specialties. House Republicans argue that uncapped student loan access has driven up tuition costs. (not investment advice)</p>
