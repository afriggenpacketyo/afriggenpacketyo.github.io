          <p>The European Union is launching an ambitious initiative to build a network of AI "gigawatt factories" to close the gap with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence. The plan involves creating centralized ecosystems that combine immense computing power, data, and talent to develop advanced AI models. With an initial investment of 20 billion euros, the EU aims to establish facilities that can power a new industrial revolution and enhance its technological sovereignty. However, the project faces significant hurdles, including high energy costs, regulatory delays, and the need for substantial private investment to fund the power-intensive infrastructure required for these massive data centers.

According to data from Rightmove, rents have increased by 44% since 2020, significantly outpacing the 36% rise in average earnings over the same period. While the pace of yearly rent increases is beginning to slow, the market remains challenging for tenants due to a persistent shortage of available properties compared to pre-pandemic levels. The steepest rent hikes were observed in commuter towns like Ascot and northern regions such as Greater Manchester, reflecting shifting demand and affordability pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from just 13% a year prior, according to research from Canalys. This surge is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to move production away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs. While China's share of U.S. smartphone imports fell to 25%, the trend highlights India's growing importance as a global electronics manufacturing hub, a development other major brands are also exploring.

SIA's operating profit also fell, signaling that margins are normalizing from pandemic-era highs as airline competition intensifies. While the airline stated that overall demand for air travel remains strong, analysts expressed concern that Air India's financial drag and weaker cargo demand could continue to negatively impact SIA's bottom line in the near term.

The verdict is the culmination of a case that began in 2012 and has deeply divided the country, where Uribe is seen by some as a savior and by others as a figure associated with human rights abuses.

This initiative follows various local pilot programs and comes as China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024.

          <p>England's victorious women's football team, the Lionesses, will be celebrated with an open-top bus parade through central London on Tuesday following their Euro 2025 final win against Spain. The procession will travel along The Mall, culminating in a ceremony at the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace. The team, which became the first English squad to win a major tournament on foreign soil, has been lauded by politicians and the public alike. The celebrations also include a special Royal Mail postmark and a government initiative to increase funding and access for women's and girls' football facilities across the country.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly denied a request from Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te for a stopover in New York during a planned trip to South America. While the official reason cited by Taiwan's Presidential Office was the need to focus on typhoon rehabilitation efforts, sources suggest the decision may be a diplomatic maneuver. Some analysts believe that avoiding a high-profile U.S. visit by the Taiwanese leader could help ease tensions with Beijing. This could potentially clear the way for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump later in the year, a significant event in international relations.</p>

          <p>Following intense international pressure, Israel has reversed its policy and is allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, with truck convoys and airdrops resuming. However, the United Nations warns that the current levels of assistance are insufficient to address the widespread hunger and malnutrition. The UN's agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, states that at least 500-600 trucks of basic supplies are needed daily, far more than the 120 that entered on Sunday. The desperation is so severe that residents are resorting to looting aid trucks, a phenomenon aid agencies call "self-distribution," which starkly illustrates the depth of the humanitarian crisis in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management has issued new guidance affirming the rights of federal employees to engage in religious expression at work. The memo states that workers can discuss their faith, display religious items, and even politely attempt to persuade colleagues of their religious views, so long as it does not constitute harassment. While the policy clarifies that employees must honor requests to stop such discussions, it has drawn sharp criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation. Critics argue the guidance is unconstitutional and could encourage supervisors to proselytize to their subordinates, creating a coercive environment.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The meeting will focus on a European-led peace plan and aid efforts, which Starmer presented to U.S. President Donald Trump during their recent meeting in Scotland. The move comes amid renewed international diplomatic efforts and growing domestic pressure on the UK government to take a stronger stance, including calls from over 140 Labour MPs to immediately recognize a Palestinian state. Downing Street has indicated that the right to statehood is a matter of "when, not if," signaling a potential shift in UK policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a formal misconduct complaint against federal Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over his handling of a case involving deportations to El Salvador. The complaint, directed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleges that the judge made improper public comments critical of the Trump administration and its willingness to comply with court orders. The conflict stems from Boasberg's order to block deportation flights, which the administration allegedly ignored. The complaint seeks an investigation and the reassignment of the case, highlighting the significant tension between the judiciary and the executive branch over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are raising alarms over the potential loss of critical mental health resources due to federal funding cuts. The Trump administration abruptly discontinued millions in grants intended to fund school counselors and social workers, citing issues with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This has left many districts, particularly in rural areas, scrambling to maintain services for students dealing with trauma and mental health crises. A CBS News analysis shows that 47 states already fall short of recommended counselor-to-student ratios, a problem that will be exacerbated if the grant funding is not restored.</p>

Kenny Laynez, who was born and raised in the U.S., was told "you got no rights here" by an officer during the May incident. The encounter, which occurred during a traffic stop, also involved the use of a Taser on his undocumented co-workers. The incident has intensified scrutiny of Florida's expanded crackdown on illegal immigration, with advocacy groups warning that deputizing more local law enforcement for immigration operations will lead to severe consequences and rights violations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic experts are analyzing the new U.S.-EU trade agreement, with many concluding that it is an "asymmetric and unbalanced deal" that heavily favors the United States. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports while eliminating tariffs on American goods exported to the EU, a move projected to reduce the EU's annual GDP. European industries, particularly automotive and wine producers, have expressed concern over the financial impact. While the deal reduces the uncertainty of a full-blown trade war, economists suggest the EU accepted unfavorable terms to avoid the threatened alternative of even higher tariffs from the Trump administration.

The article notes that engaging with Trump's freewheeling, often unpredictable style of diplomacy provides Starmer with crucial face time to build a relationship with a key ally. However, it also presents jeopardy, as Starmer must carefully navigate Trump's public commentary on sensitive topics like Gaza and immigration. The visit is framed as a key test of Starmer's ability to manage the UK-US relationship and align on critical international issues.</p>

          <p>University of Southern California offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to play in the upcoming season after his request for an eligibility waiver was denied. The lawsuit challenges the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," which limits athletes to four seasons of competition within a five-year period. Wingfield argues that disruptions from the pandemic and a season-ending injury should warrant an exception. The case could have significant implications for USC's offense, which is thin on the offensive line, and adds to the growing number of legal challenges questioning the NCAA's amateurism and eligibility rules.</p>
