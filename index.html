          <h2>Ukraine's President Signs Controversial Law Limiting Anti-Corruption Agency Independence, Sparking Protests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a contentious bill that critics argue severely undermines the country's anti-corruption framework by placing independent agencies under the control of the prosecutor general. The law, which affects the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), has triggered the largest anti-government protests since the 2022 invasion, with demonstrations in Kyiv and other major cities. International partners, including the EU and G7, have expressed significant concern, as Ukraine's progress in fighting corruption is a key condition for receiving Western financial aid and for its European Union membership aspirations.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has publicly spoken about the profound humiliation she experienced after discovering her face was used in violent and explicit AI-generated deepfake pornography. She revealed that numerous other female parliamentarians have also been targeted, highlighting the real-world consequences and potential for inciting violence from such digital fabrications. Mordaunt is advocating for stricter online safety measures, including robust age verification for pornographic sites and social media, and supports the government's initiative to criminalize the creation and distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes, stressing the urgent need to protect children from harmful online content.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic and pioneering frontman of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's powerful vocals and theatrical stage presence helped define the genre in the 1970s before he was dismissed from the band due to substance abuse issues. He subsequently launched a highly successful solo career and later achieved a new level of fame with his family on the reality TV show "The Osbournes." Despite a life marked by notorious antics and health struggles, including a recent Parkinson's diagnosis, he continued to record and perform, leaving an indelible legacy on rock music.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a major trade agreement with Japan, which includes imposing a 15% tariff on Japanese goods imported into the United States. President Trump stated that the deal also involves a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and to open its markets further to American products, specifically including cars, trucks, and certain agricultural goods. This agreement follows a period of intense negotiations where the U.S. had threatened higher tariffs, reflecting the administration's broader strategy of using such levies as leverage to restructure global trade relationships and address perceived imbalances.

While the court's opinion will be non-binding, it is expected to establish a significant legal precedent for what nations must do to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. This ruling could become a foundational tool for future domestic and international climate-related legal actions and agreements.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at 0.8% in June, remaining at its lowest point in over four years and falling short of economists' forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes volatile transport and accommodation costs, also remained unchanged at 0.6%, providing a clear signal of easing price pressures within the economy. This sustained low-inflation environment gives the Monetary Authority of Singapore significant flexibility to consider easing its monetary policy in its upcoming decision. The central bank remains cautious, citing a subdued domestic growth forecast due to an uncertain global trade environment and the lagging effects of international tariffs on the nation's export-dependent economy.

          <p>Germany's top administrative court has finalized a ruling that allows the domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to classify the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "suspected right-wing extremist" group.

The court cited a justified suspicion that a significant portion of the AfD supports degrading the legal status of German citizens with immigrant backgrounds.

In the sixth and seventh innings, Dodgers relievers issued a series of walks and committed a glaring fielding error that allowed the Twins to score six runs on just two hits, turning a tied game into a significant deficit. The performance highlighted the team's ongoing struggles with its injury-depleted relief corps, which has been a key factor in their recent slump, having now lost 11 of their last 14 games.

The influx of tourists, particularly international visitors, has also led to a surge in short-term holiday lets, further straining the residential community. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, some residents feel the balance has tipped too far, diminishing the quality of life for those who call the Old Town home.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has taken disciplinary action, including suspensions and expulsions, against approximately 80 students for their involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests earlier this year. The protests included the occupation of a campus library and the establishment of an encampment, which the university stated were violations of its policies. The Ivy League institution said each case was assessed individually, with punishments ranging from probation to degree revocation. This move comes as the university attempts to restore federal funding that was cut following accusations that it failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus during the demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge after it was announced that the U.S. would lower its tariff on imported vehicles to 15% from a threatened 25%. Toyota's stock jumped over 15%, while others saw similar double-digit gains. The news provided immediate relief to Japan's auto industry, which is a cornerstone of its economy and heavily reliant on exports to the American market. The reduced tariff was part of a broader trade agreement announced by President Trump, which he hailed as a historic deal beneficial to the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

They are urging parents to engage in discussions about online safety with their children and to utilize parental controls on devices. The warning highlights a growing threat from online gangs that commit a range of crimes, including those related to extremism.</p>

          <p>Emmy-winning actor Jeff Daniels has once again voiced strong criticism of President Donald Trump and his supporters, specifically targeting the economic impact of the administration's tariff policies. In a podcast interview, Daniels issued a pointed message to voters who supported Trump, saying, "I hope you’re losing tons of money." He argued that the real-world financial consequences of the tariffs, such as higher grocery bills and increased car prices, would ultimately be what turns public opinion against the president. A White House spokesperson responded by calling Daniels an "out-of-touch left-wing Hollywood clown" and asserted that the economy is thriving under the current administration.</p>

          <p>A 13-million-year-old fossilized leg bone of a 'terror bird,' a large, flightless predator, displays distinct teeth marks that scientists believe were made by an even larger reptile. Researchers in Colombia used 3D digital scans to match the bite marks to an extinct caiman species called Purussaurus neivensis, which could grow up to five meters long. The analysis suggests a violent confrontation between two of the era's top predators in the ancient swamps of what is now the Tatacoa Desert. Because the bone shows no signs of healing, scientists conclude the terror bird either died in the attack or was scavenged shortly after, providing rare insight into this prehistoric ecosystem.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, federal judges in New Jersey have sidelined interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal attorney to President Trump, and appointed her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the top prosecutor role. However, hours later, the Trump administration ousted Grace, with the Justice Department accusing the judges of being "rogue" and undermining the president's authority. The judiciary's decision to replace Habba came after her 120-day interim appointment expired without Senate confirmation. The subsequent firing of Grace, a career prosecutor, was condemned by New Jersey's Democratic senators as a blatant attempt to undermine judicial independence.</p>

While the plea deal avoids a painful trial and provides a degree of closure for some families, it leaves the "why" behind the brutal murders a mystery, concluding a tragic chapter for Moscow, Idaho, without full explanation.</p>

          <p>Economists are advising Chinese companies to more deeply integrate their operations within the economies of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) as a strategy to counter U.S. efforts to crack down on trade transshipments. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods suspected of being diverted through countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. By establishing genuine, long-term local operations rather than just using ASEAN countries as pass-through points, Chinese firms can better navigate unpredictable tariff policies and contribute more substantively to regional economies, according to the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office.

An MRI revealed no structural or ligament damage after Scott exited a recent game with a stinging sensation in his forearm. While the loss of Scott, a key offseason acquisition, is a blow to an already struggling bullpen, the diagnosis is a significant relief for the team. The injury further highlights the Dodgers' need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the upcoming trade deadline to bolster their pitching staff for the remainder of the season.</p>

Despite her reporting the incident in September, it took nearly six months for the perpetrator to be arrested and convicted.
