          <p>MI5 provided false information to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO) regarding its handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent, leading the watchdog to rewrite a report. The original draft contradicted MI5's false evidence given in court, but the final version did not, effectively misleading every organization and court responsible for overseeing the Security Service. MI5 Director General Sir Ken McCallum apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the false statements. The article highlights concerns about IPCO's reliance on assurances from MI5 and raises questions about the Security Service's adherence to legal and public interest standards.</p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant amidst growing tensions between the United States and China. The goal is to reduce dependencies on the US for defense and technology, China for raw materials and cleantech, and Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the key proponents of this strategic autonomy. The EU has sought economic concessions from China in exchange for improved political relations, but Brussels now believes China has declined this offer.</p>

          <p>Despite the reliance of the Pentagon and NASA on Elon Musk's businesses, former President Trump retains options to penalize Musk. Even if terminating federal contracts is infeasible, Trump could tighten federal oversight of Musk's various ventures. This scrutiny could potentially impact Musk's companies like SpaceX and Tesla, depending on the nature and extent of the oversight implemented by the administration.

          <p>A man in southern England discovered that his father had been swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago, resolving a long-standing family joke about the father not resembling his parents. The discovery was made through a home DNA test, which revealed unfamiliar relatives and led to the unearthing of birth records from 1946. BBC News is aware of five cases of babies swapped by mistake in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Lawyers anticipate more cases to emerge due to the increased availability of affordable genetic testing.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, the president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) California, was injured and detained while documenting an immigration enforcement raid in downtown Los Angeles. The labor union stated that Huerta was detained while exercising his First Amendment right to observe law enforcement activity, while federal authorities claim he obstructed their access to a worksite. Elected officials have condemned Huerta's arrest, while federal authorities maintain that interfering with federal officers is illegal.

          <p>Global spirit makers are confronting a challenging mix of tariffs and evolving drinking habits. French cognac maker RÃ©my Cointreau recently withdrew its sales targets due to increased economic and trade uncertainty, following similar moves by Diageo and Pernod Ricard. The cognac business has been particularly affected by ongoing U.S.-Sino tensions, with LVMH also experiencing a decline in Hennessy sales.
