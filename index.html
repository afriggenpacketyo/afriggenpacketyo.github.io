          <p>Newspapers across the UK are covering Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new trade deal with the EU, which aims to secure cheaper food and energy. The Times highlights the deal's promise to boost the economy by £9 billion a year, while critics label it a "sell-out on fishing rights." The Guardian emphasizes the PM's claim that the deal puts Britain back on the world stage, granting unprecedented access to the EU market, but also notes Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch's concerns about concessions on youth visas and fishing. The papers also cover Britain, France, and Canada's warning to Netanyahu regarding Gaza.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the raised funds to construct its factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients, including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition, the company's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world's largest maker of batteries for electric cars, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were blocked from buying its stock due to escalating tensions between China and the United States.

The move signals a deepening financial decoupling between the two countries, potentially limiting U.S. investors' access to profitable opportunities.

          <p>The Cato Institute reports that at least 50 Venezuelan men sent by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had entered the US legally. The report analyzed immigration data for a portion of the men deported to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot). The Cato Institute’s analysis goes against the Trump administration’s claim that only undocumented people were deported to El Salvador. Separately, the Supreme Court sided with Trump on Venezuelans’ protected status, allowing his administration to end legal protections that have shielded about 350,000 Venezuelans from potential deportation.</p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in rates since October. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as a slew of state-backed commercial lenders moved to reduce their deposit rates by as much as 25 basis points earlier Tuesday in an effort to protect their net interest margin, paving the way to lower key lending rates. The bundle of rate cuts came as part of a package of stimulus measures announced by Beijing earlier this month. (not investment advice)</p>

Retail investors in Hong Kong borrowed more than HK$282 billion in margin financing from brokerages to bid for CATL, or 105 times the value of shares allocated to them in the offering.
