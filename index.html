          <p>Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the U.S. lacks a strong tradition of promoting financial literacy, leaving young investors vulnerable to risky 'get-rich-quick' schemes. He cautions against overly complex financial products and advises young people to seek financial information from credible sources rather than platforms like TikTok. Edelman notes that while many young investors lack funds, they are motivated to achieve financial success, especially after seeing their parents struggle with retirement. He also points out the positive trend of more states requiring personal finance courses in high schools.</p>

          <p>A creative writing program at a Maine correctional center for women was eliminated after the federal government revoked funding due to the state housing a transgender woman in a women's facility. The author, a volunteer teacher at the prison, describes the program as a place of rehabilitation and repair for incarcerated women, where they could reclaim their identities and heal from trauma. The decision to cut funding also eliminated a substance use treatment initiative and a re-entry program, impacting hundreds of incarcerated individuals. The author argues that prison should be a place of rehabilitation, and she advocates for the dignity and worth of incarcerated women.</p>

The price of items like Barbie dolls, washing machines, and leggings have risen in the weeks following the announcement. A Target-exclusive Barbie doll increased by nearly 43%, while a Whirlpool washing machine at Lowe's went up by nearly $82. While these changes aren't definitive evidence of tariff impact, retailers and brands indicate that higher costs will likely be passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. air traffic control system is facing significant strain due to years of staffing shortages, underinvestment, and aging infrastructure, highlighted by a recent equipment failure at a Philadelphia facility that caused widespread flight delays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled a plan to replace outdated radar and communication systems, requiring significant funding from Congress. The plan calls for replacing 618 radars, constructing six new air traffic control centers, and installing new fiber optic, wireless, and satellite systems. Airlines and industry members have applauded the spending proposal to improve air traffic control and staffing.</p>

          <p>Businesses across the U.S. are preparing for a decline in sales as international tourism decreases due to trade tensions and concerns over immigration policies. The decline in foreign visitors has led to falling sales, particularly for businesses that rely on tourism. The pullback in tourism is more of a U.S. issue, as other regions are seeing positive tourism growth. The loss in international tourism is expected to cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars this year, with small businesses already experiencing a sharp decline in profits.</p>

Bentzel sustained a gash on his hand, and the hikers decided to cut their trip short. Despite the ordeal, Bentzel emphasizes that the mother bear was only protecting her cubs and holds no ill feelings towards bears, highlighting the importance of bear safety and preparedness in the wilderness.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces the risk of being labeled 'Too Late' by President Trump, as the Fed navigates a complex economic landscape influenced by tariffs and conflicting signals. Despite pressure from Trump to cut rates, Powell is maintaining a cautious approach, citing a 'solid' economy and a strong labor market. However, some economists believe that waiting for confirmation from the labor market may result in a delayed response, potentially leading to economic consequences. Powell's current strategy of inaction reflects the challenges posed by the unpredictable policy environment.</p>

A shrinking population can lead to economic challenges, a smaller workforce supporting a larger elderly population, and a decline in overall quality of life. The author suggests that policies supporting family formation, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare, align with progressive values and could help stabilize the population.</p>
