          <p>Novo Nordisk is partnering with telehealth providers Hims & Hers Health, Ro, and Life MD to offer its weight loss drug Wegovy more widely in the U.S., especially as legal restrictions increase on compounding pharmacies making cheaper versions. This collaboration aims to create a seamless experience for patients, allowing them to access Wegovy directly from their telehealth providers and have it shipped to their homes. The Danish drugmaker is also launching its own direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare, offering Wegovy at a reduced cash price for uninsured patients. Each telehealth company's price may be higher because they likely include additional services.</p>

          <p>Honeywell's stock experienced a significant jump following a first-quarter earnings report that exceeded Wall Street expectations, with both sales and adjusted earnings per share surpassing forecasts. The company's organic sales growth of 4% and stable segment margin contributed to the positive outlook. While management maintained its guidance, the company factored in the impact of tariffs and potential demand risks in the latter half of the year. Despite the positive results, Jim Cramer advises caution, suggesting that initial gains may not be sustainable due to the uncertain tariff environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer is expanding its cost-cutting efforts, now expecting savings of roughly $7.7 billion by the end of 2027, and reported first-quarter profit that topped estimates, even as the company's sales fell. The expanded cuts include research and organizational re-organization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, the company added. The company said that will be driven in large part by "enhanced digital enablement," including automation and artificial intelligence and streamlining business processes. The cuts aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the last few years, and appear to be paying off.</p>

At a Hong Kong event last week, several prominent China watchers from across the Pacific voiced concern over tariffs, the political upheaval in the United States, and the spectre of global instability as the US-led liberal world order unravels. Despite their stark differences over America’s perceived decline and China’s role in bilateral tensions , observers largely agreed that the US leader’s unpredictability and his “America first” doctrine have intensified superpower rivalry and recent global market turmoil.</p>

The article notes that fitness tests are appealing because it is nice being told exactly what to do and feeling accomplished when you follow these orders. However, it also states that turning rules into sustainable habits is often harder than it seems watching popular influencers discuss their routines, not to mention deeply dependent on so many physical and lifestyle factors. The article suggests that the extremely online outlook on fitness ignores the reality that exercise is a very individual thing based on a person’s relationship to their body and with physical activity.</p>

Former collegiate athletes have spread out across the country, signing for clubs by mutual consent as free agents, and have begun to make their mark, like Duke University alumna Maggie Graham.
