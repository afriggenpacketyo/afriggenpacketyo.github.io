          <p>Senate Republicans are largely aligning with President Trump's handling of the conflict between Israel and Iran, expressing trust in his judgment regarding potential U.S. involvement. While some within Trump's MAGA base are divided on further intervention, citing his campaign promise to avoid foreign wars, key Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham endorse the use of force if diplomacy fails to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Democrats, in contrast, advocate for congressional approval before any military action and emphasize de-escalation efforts. Despite differing views, most Republicans agree with Trump that Iran must not possess nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate confirmed Rodney Scott as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) despite accusations of orchestrating a ‚Äúcover-up‚Äù related to the 2010 death of Anastasio Hern√°ndez Rojas. The confirmation vote was largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting Scott. Critics, including former CBP official James Wong, cited concerns about Scott's handling of the investigation into Hern√°ndez Rojas's death, alleging unlawful use of a subpoena to obtain medical records. Scott has also faced scrutiny for his involvement in a private Facebook group where offensive content was shared, and for his alignment with Trump's immigration policies.</p>

The Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth, criticized the decision, noting that the program has provided life-saving services to over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering military strikes against Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, according to a source familiar with intelligence. The plan involves multiple strikes, and preparations are underway. Trump is gauging the MAGA base's reaction through Vice President JD Vance and has been briefed on the security of U.S. Army bases, which are vulnerable to Iranian retaliation. This consideration arises after Israeli discoveries indicated that not all Iranian air defenses were neutralized as initially believed, heightening concerns.</p>

The chicken dishes are possibly linked to a listeria outbreak that has resulted in three deaths, one fetal loss, and seventeen illnesses across 13 states. Consumers are urged to discard or return the recalled products, as listeria infection can cause serious health issues, especially for older adults, those with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women.</p>

The verdict followed a first trial that collapsed due to a hung jury. Read's defense argued she was framed, while prosecutors claimed she intentionally ran over O'Keefe.

The disagreement arose during a phone call initiated by Trump, who has repeatedly asserted the U.S.'s significant role in resolving the conflict.

          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated, which may require a reduction in monthly benefits by about 19%. The Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees, contributed to the earlier depletion date. The program faces a financial crunch due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population. Experts suggest raising revenue by lifting the income cap or adjusting the retirement age as potential solutions, but these options have sparked debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick is rapidly intensifying and is forecast to become a major hurricane as it approaches southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane warnings and watches for the coast of southern Mexico, with the storm expected to bring destructive winds and life-threatening flash floods. Erick is forecast to produce heavy rainfall, leading to potentially dangerous flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Dangerous storm surge is also expected to cause coastal flooding and large waves. Acapulco, previously devastated by Hurricane Otis, is in the path of Erick.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could cause instability in our solar system, potentially flinging Earth out of orbit or into the sun. Computer simulations indicate that passing stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years. While the chances of such changes occurring are low, they are exponentially greater for Mercury. The gravitational tug could also destabilize Pluto and increase the risk of collision or ejection for Mars. Despite the low probability, the possibility of a collision with Earth is higher than previously thought.</p>

The changes eliminate property size and energy score qualifications, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million households with children. Energy companies will fund the discount, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers, though the government claims savings from cutting energy company expenditures will offset this rise. The scheme aims to provide additional support to those struggling with energy costs, though some argue it still excludes vulnerable individuals.</p>

The jury acquitted her of the most serious charges, including second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene after an accident. Supporters of Read gathered outside the courthouse, celebrating the verdict. The defense had argued that Read's vehicle did not hit O'Keefe, and instead, he was attacked by a dog and beaten by others before being left in the snow.

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, with clinical trial data suggesting that just two injections a year provide near-complete protection against HIV infection. The drug offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada. The twice-yearly injection could reach more people, particularly those who face stigma for taking a daily medication. The high cost of the drug, roughly $28,000 a year, could limit access. Lenacapavir's power to prevent infection lies in its ability to disrupt the virus's capsid, preventing replication for about six months.</p>
