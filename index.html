          <p>China's Hainan Island is preparing for the imminent arrival of Typhoon Bualoi, prompting the city of Sanya to suspend all flights and neighboring Haikou to close its port as a precautionary measure. The typhoon, closely following Super Typhoon Ragasa, is expected to strengthen further and bring significant heavy rainfall and strong winds to coastal areas, including the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Guangdong province. The China Meteorological Administration has issued a yellow typhoon and heavy rain warning, the third-highest alert level, indicating the storm's serious potential impact. Local authorities are implementing these stringent measures to ensure public safety and minimize potential damage across the affected regions, with most of Hainan Island falling within the typhoon’s seventh-level wind zone.</p>

          <p>Graham Potter has been sacked by West Ham after only eight months, marking his second brutal dismissal following a brief stint at Chelsea, where he claimed to be a victim of a "perfect storm." Once considered a potential England successor, Potter's carefully built reputation has suffered from chaotic environments at both clubs, contrasting sharply with his successful, patient approach at Brighton. Despite waiting 637 days for what he believed was the ideal club, his low-key personality and wretched results, winning only six of 25 matches, failed to win over West Ham's demanding fans. This article discusses his spectacular fall from grace, highlighting how his strength as an organizer and tactician seemed lost, and speculates on his next career move, suggesting a big Premier League post is now highly improbable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran through a "snapback" mechanism, further pressuring the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program. This action, triggered by France, Germany, and the UK due to Iran's non-compliance, freezes Iranian assets abroad and halts arms deals, exacerbating an already reeling economy with the rial at a record low and soaring food prices. The article highlights growing public anxiety over potential conflict with Israel and the U.S., alongside a reported surge in executions, making daily life increasingly challenging for Iranians. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, but its uranium enrichment levels are a short technical step from weapons-grade, and it has further restricted International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring.</p>

          <p>Swiss voters are heading to the polls for a second time to decide on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after rejecting a similar proposal in 2021 due to data protection concerns and private company involvement. The revised proposal ensures the new system remains entirely optional, publicly managed, and stores data on user smartphones rather than centrally, aiming to alleviate privacy fears. Supporters argue the e-IDs will significantly streamline various bureaucratic procedures, from telephone contracts to age verification, making online interactions much easier. However, opponents, who forced this referendum, still fear potential data tracking and marketing use, despite the government's recommendation for a "yes" vote and recent polls indicating increased voter acceptance.</p>

Manager Eddie Howe acknowledges the issue, taking responsibility for the team's inability to capitalize on their height advantage and extensive tactical work, which led to success in previous seasons. The article highlights a notable shift in their approach, including a significant increase in long throws into the box, reflecting a wider trend in football. However, their conversion rate from dead-ball situations remains low compared to opponents like Arsenal, who top the league in expected goals from set-pieces, indicating Newcastle has considerable work to do to improve their score.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's recently announced "framework consensus" deal regarding TikTok, despite its presentation as a victory for the United States, may in fact provide significant strategic leverage for China. While the agreement purports to place American user data, servers, and algorithms firmly under U.S. control and includes a multibillion-dollar payment, the actual ownership structure is less reassuring. Global investors already hold roughly 60% of ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, and the deal merely raises U.S. ownership of the American operation to 80%, leaving ByteDance as the single largest shareholder with just under 20%. This perspective suggests China retains substantial influence over the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett criticizes Donald Trump's contentious claims about autism, including seeking a "cure," by highlighting positive autistic traits. The author argues that autistic individuals often demonstrate a capacity for deep, intense focus, a strong adherence to facts and logic, and profound empathy, qualities she contrasts with Trump's scattergun approach and perceived lack of compassion. The article challenges the narrative of autism as a tragedy, instead celebrating the "puresT joy" and profound love observed in autistic people, often expressed through unique stims or gestures. It suggests that these inherent strengths offer valuable lessons for societal progress and directly counter Trump's problematic framing of the condition.</p>

          <p>Hairy crab prices in China have fallen significantly, down by about 20 yuan per kilogram compared to last year, on the eve of the "super golden week" holiday. Industry insiders predict further price drops, citing increased production, shrinking demand for gift-giving, and overall weak household spending as key factors. This year's extended eight-day holiday, combining National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival, is being viewed as a crucial litmus test for domestic demand across various sectors, including retail, travel, and dining. The article also notes that warmer climate conditions have led to earlier maturation of the crabs, with peak flavor expected late this month rather than later, adding another dimension to the current market dynamics.

He criticized Reform's proposal to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain, arguing it would unfairly impact long-term contributors to British society, while Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood suggested tightening ILR rules. The conference is positioned as a crucial opportunity for Labour to present a patriotic alternative to "toxic divide and decline."</p>

This article highlights the Ellisons' rapid ascent, from tech and film to broadcasting, and the political scrutiny surrounding their expanding influence in the U.S. media landscape, with calls from Senator Elizabeth Warren to block further consolidation.</p>

          <p>Thousands marched in Buenos Aires, Argentina, demanding justice for three women, Morena Verdi, Brenda Del Castillo, and Lara Gutierrez, whose torture and murders were reportedly broadcast live on a private social media account. The victims' bodies were found buried five days after their disappearance, with investigators linking the triple femicide to drug gangs as a "punishment" and "warning" message for breaking gang rules. This article highlights the widespread outrage and calls for greater protection for women, as family members expressed profound grief over the horrific abuse, with one father unable to identify his daughter's body. Police have detained five suspects following joint efforts, though the alleged Peruvian mastermind remains at large, while Instagram's parent company, Meta, disputed that the livestream occurred on its platform.</p>

          <h2>Sean Penn Reflects on Charlie Kirk's Assassination, Calls for Debate</h2>

          <p>Sean Penn commented on the assassination of conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk, describing it as "different" from other recent high-profile killings, including those of a health insurance CEO and a state representative. Penn, who admitted not following Kirk's work but suspected they disagreed on most issues, argued that "we need that guy" and "that debate" in society. He emphasized the importance of engaging with deeply held beliefs, even those one disagrees with, to find compromise, distinguishing between legitimate differing opinions and "sociopathic Nazism." This article captures Penn's thoughtful, albeit complex, reflection on political polarization and the nature of violence in contemporary America, questioning if assassination is "the best argument you got" for any cause.</p>

          <h2>Indian Researchers Win Ig Nobel Prize for Study on Smelly Shoes and Shoe Rack Design</h2>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have won an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the experience of using a shoe rack. Inspired by cluttered hostel corridors, their research confirmed that shoe odor, primarily caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, was the main reason for footwear being left outside. Their inventive scientific endeavor involved surveying students and conducting experiments to measure odor levels, leading to the development of a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack. This innovative design aims to sterilize shoes and eliminate odor in just 2-3 minutes, transforming a common domestic problem into a practical and delightfully oddball scientific solution that "makes people laugh, then think."</p>
