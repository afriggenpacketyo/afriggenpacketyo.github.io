The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and Rick Rieder. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will conduct another round of interviews before presenting a shorter list to President Trump for the final decision. The nominee may first be appointed as a Fed governor to secure a full 14-year term before being elevated to chair. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement emphasized the global trend of democracy being in retreat and praised Machado for uniting the opposition and consistently supporting a non-violent path.

The agreement's first phase includes the release of all remaining hostages within 72 hours in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. As part of the deal, the IDF will maintain control over more than half of Gaza, and an increase in humanitarian aid is expected. The U.S. Central Command is setting up a coordination center in Israel with 200 personnel to monitor the truce and assist with aid logistics.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will begin charging U.S. ships for docking at its ports, a direct retaliation against similar fees imposed by Washington on Chinese vessels. The Chinese Ministry of Transport stated the U.S. fees violate international trade principles and will harm maritime trade relations between the two nations. Beijing's new charges will mirror the American fees, starting at 400 yuan ($56) per net ton and increasing over time until 2028. This move is seen as another escalation in the ongoing trade tensions, which analysts suggest could increase costs for U.S. consumers and shippers in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government has formally requested an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to address recent U.S. military actions in the Caribbean. Caracas alleges mounting threats and expressed expectations of an imminent "armed attack" from the United States. The request follows four deadly U.S. military strikes on boats claimed to be involved in drug trafficking, which Venezuela argues is a pretext for a regime change policy. In its letter to the U.N., Venezuela accused the Trump administration of threatening regional peace and stability in an effort to seize control of the nation's natural resources.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted one of the largest concentrated attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, using hundreds of drones and missiles to target civilian and power infrastructure across the country. The overnight strikes caused widespread blackouts in nine regions, damaged residential buildings in Kyiv, and resulted in at least one child's death in the southeast. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assault as a calculated effort to terrorize civilians ahead of the winter heating season. He issued an urgent call to international allies, including the U.S. and Europe, for more advanced air defense systems and stricter sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm fell after China's State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) announced an antitrust investigation into the company. The probe centers on Qualcomm's acquisition of Israeli chip firm Autotalks, with regulators suspecting a violation of China's anti-monopoly laws. This action is part of a broader trend of increased scrutiny by Chinese authorities on U.S. tech firms, escalating tensions ahead of an expected meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The investigation follows similar actions against other American companies, including Nvidia, and new export controls on rare earths. (not investment advice)</p>

His departure occurred just before the Vuelta a España, a race that saw multiple pro-Palestinian protests targeting the team.

While acknowledging the financial appeal for players, Shore contrasted R360's profit-driven model with the PWR's role in developing the sport from grassroots to elite levels.

The case tests the limits of presidential power, as the National Guard is typically directed by state governors for domestic events.

          <p>The United States will deploy up to 200 troops, already stationed in the Middle East, to Israel to help monitor the new ceasefire in Gaza. These forces will not enter Gaza but will form the core of a multinational civil-military coordination center designed to oversee the truce and coordinate humanitarian aid. The taskforce, led by U.S. Central Command, is expected to include personnel from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE. This move is part of the first phase of a broader peace plan, which commenced with the ceasefire and the planned exchange of hostages and prisoners between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a consultation on whether to include children aged 13 and over in its planned national digital ID system. The announcement came in response to a petition opposing the scheme that has garnered nearly three million signatures over concerns about mass surveillance and digital control. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the plan, noting that many teenagers already use forms of digital ID. Civil liberties groups have criticized the proposal as "Orwellian" and sinister, questioning the future applications of a system that would enroll children into a sprawling national database.</p>

          <h2>An Analysis of How the Founding Fathers Might View Modern America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 05:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay contemplates what the leaders of the American Revolution would think of the United States in 2025, acknowledging the vast differences in their worldview while using their principles as a lens for critique. The author suggests the Founders would be horrified by modern political sycophancy, the erosion of a shared public sphere, and the extreme economic inequality that threatens republican ideals. They would also likely be dismayed by the rise of Christian nationalism, which contradicts their vision of separating church and state. While they created a system with deep flaws, their core ideas about liberty, equality, and rational debate remain a potent standard against which to measure the present.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Colonial Williamsburg, America's largest living-history museum, is navigating the challenge of presenting a complete and truthful account of the nation's founding. The museum has evolved from a nostalgic, patriotic vision to one that directly confronts the paradox of liberty and slavery, often making visitors uncomfortable. Interpreters portraying figures like Thomas Jefferson and the enslaved spy James Armistead Lafayette engage with the public on these difficult topics daily. The recent excavation of the historic First Baptist Church, founded by enslaved and free Black worshippers, further highlights the site's commitment to telling the stories of all its historical residents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Amanda Vaill's book 'Pride and Pleasure,' using the lives of the Schuyler sisters—Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy—to explore the often-overlooked role of women in the American Revolution. It argues that women's history should not be a sideshow to the main narrative of public power, but a central part of it, as the revolution began in the household. The essay highlights Eliza Schuyler Hamilton's long widowhood, during which she became a pioneering activist, founding an orphan asylum and preserving the historical records of the Founders. This work demonstrates how women shaped the early republic, both in private and through their own burgeoning public influence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores how Abraham Lincoln viewed the American Revolution not as a static, historical event to be worshipped, but as an unfinished project with living ideals. Facing a civil war where both sides claimed to be the Revolution's true heirs, Lincoln confronted the injustice of slavery as a threat that could invalidate the nation's founding principles. He argued that the Declaration of Independence set a standard of universal equality to be "constantly approximated" over generations. By framing the Civil War and emancipation as a "new birth of freedom," Lincoln sought to redeem the past and fully realize the noblest values of 1776 for all people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines Washington Irving's classic story "Rip Van Winkle" as a foundational American folktale that explores the nation's relationship with memory and change. Published in 1819, the story of a man who sleeps through the Revolutionary War is presented not just as a comic tale but as a meditation on creating a new national identity while retaining ties to the past. The essay argues that the story's purpose was to provide a color of romance and tradition to a young country largely lacking in its own mythology. By becoming a beloved patriarch and a living link to the pre-war era, Rip himself becomes a story the nation knows by heart.</p>

In its statement, the ministry warned that these individuals would be held accountable for life under China's Anti-Secession Law.

          <p>Japan's Komeito party has reportedly withdrawn from the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), a major political shift that could disrupt Sanae Takaichi's path to becoming prime minister. Komeito's leader cited the LDP's failure to adequately address political funding scandals as the reason for ending the alliance that has existed since 1999. The split leaves the LDP as a minority government just days before a parliamentary vote to select the next leader. While this complicates Takaichi's ability to pass legislation, analysts suggest she is still likely to become prime minister due to a disunited opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted "nonactionable opinion" rather than a verifiable statement of fact. The court determined that a reasonable listener would understand the accusations within the context of a heated and hyperbolic rap battle, not as fact-checked content. Drake had sued the record label, which represents both artists, alleging the track tarnished his reputation and led to security threats at his home.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The charges, brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, relate to a mortgage she obtained for a property in Virginia, which prosecutors allege she falsely claimed as a secondary residence to secure a more favorable loan. James has denied any wrongdoing, calling the case a "desperate weaponization of our justice system" and an act of political revenge orchestrated by President Trump. This indictment follows James's own high-profile civil fraud case against Trump and his company.</p>
