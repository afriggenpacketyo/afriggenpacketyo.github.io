          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff stated he is "inspired" by data analytics company Palantir, particularly its high market valuation, while also noting its software is the "most expensive" he has ever seen.

This public commentary underscores the ongoing rivalry between the two enterprise software giants, which sometimes compete for major government contracts.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The 33-hour manhunt concluded after the suspect's father recognized him from FBI images and urged him to surrender, leading to his capture by U.S. Marshals. Investigators found politically charged inscriptions on rifle casings at the scene and noted the suspect had previously expressed negative views about Kirk. Robinson is now facing charges including aggravated murder and obstruction of justice.</p>

          <p>During the federal trial of Ryan Routh, prosecutors presented evidence intended to connect him to the alleged sniper's nest found during an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. An FBI special agent testified about items recovered from the scene, including a rifle, backpacks, and a flashlight, comparing them to photos and belongings of Routh. The court also heard from bomb squad and tactical officers who described discovering the hideout near the 6th hole of Trump International Golf Club. Routh has pleaded not guilty to multiple federal charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has canceled its plans to produce a fully electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, attributing the decision to slowing demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in North America. The company had previously delayed the truck's launch, which was originally slated for 2024. Instead of a full BEV, Ram will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, which includes a gasoline engine to generate electricity. This strategic shift reflects broader adjustments within the automotive industry as automakers reassess their EV product strategies.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of migrants held at the Migrant Operations Center. The disruption, caused by structural damage to an underwater pipeline, has heightened concerns about the base's capacity to handle the large number of migrants the Trump administration intends to send there. Critics argue the incident highlights that the base's infrastructure is inadequate for large-scale detention, pointing to the high costs and logistical challenges of the operation.</p>

          <p>The European Commission will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars, according to President Ursula von der Leyen. The decision follows intense pressure from European automakers, who have cited significant challenges including high manufacturing costs, a lack of charging infrastructure, and stiff competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Carmakers are calling for a relaxation of the rules, potentially allowing for hybrid technologies beyond 2035, to ensure the industry's competitiveness during the green transition.</p>

          <p>Russia and its ally Belarus have begun their large-scale joint military exercise, known as "Zapad 2025," prompting heightened alert among neighboring NATO countries. The war games, held every four years, are taking place in Belarus and western Russia, close to the borders of Poland and Lithuania. The exercises are occurring amid escalating regional tensions, including a recent Russian drone incursion into Poland, raising concerns that the drills could be a precursor to further aggressive actions, similar to how Zapad 2021 preceded the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
