        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An army unit in Madagascar, known as CAPSAT, has claimed control of the military command amidst widespread protests against President Andry Rajoelina's government. The president's office condemned the action as an illegal and forceful attempt to seize power, violating the nation's constitution. The unrest stems from public dissatisfaction over unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis, with protesters now occupying a key square in the capital. The situation remains tense as the African Union calls for dialogue, and some international flights have been suspended due to the instability.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to mark the signing of a Gaza peace plan. The summit, led by the US and Egypt, follows a ceasefire agreement brokered by former President Trump between Israel and Hamas. Downing Street stated Starmer will pay tribute to the diplomatic efforts of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey in reaching this point. However, UK officials' claims of having played a "key role" have been disputed by both US and Israeli representatives.</p>

          <p>Brighton defender Maelys Mpome is reported to be "up and about" after a frightening incident during a Women's Super League match against Arsenal. Mpome was knocked unconscious and suffered a concussion after being struck in the face by the ball, leading to a 10-minute stoppage in play. Medics attended to her on the field before she was carried off on a stretcher as a precaution, receiving oxygen with her head in a brace. Brighton's manager later provided a positive update, confirming she was recovering with her teammates in the changing room after the game.</p>

          <p>The first phase of a comprehensive peace plan for Gaza involves a reciprocal exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, which is set to begin Monday. This initial step follows a ceasefire that took effect on Friday and has allowed increased humanitarian aid into the territory. The plan, brokered by the US, also outlines a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops and the deployment of a multinational monitoring force. Future phases, which include the demilitarization of Gaza and establishing a new governing body, present significant challenges that require further negotiation.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, China deferred a request from the United States for a phone call to discuss America's expansion of its rare earths export controls. The diplomatic outreach occurred amidst escalating trade tensions between the two economic powers. Vice President J.D. Vance commented on the situation, urging Beijing to "choose the path of reason" and suggesting that the U.S. currently holds more leverage in the delicate negotiations. The interaction highlights the strained communication and strategic maneuvering characterizing the current state of U.S.-China trade relations.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in London, largely thanks to a formidable defensive performance. The Broncos' defense sacked Jets quarterback Justin Fields nine times and held New York's offense to a mere 82 total yards for the entire game. Offensively, a first-quarter touchdown pass from Bo Nix to Nate Adkins was the decisive score for Denver. The victory improves the Broncos' season record to 4-2, while the struggling Jets remain winless at 0-6 after another anemic offensive showing.</p>

The initiative aims to establish a broader political framework for the region, with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution.

The effort underscores Europe's attempt to engage in the region's future, even as the US-led peace plan outlines a more limited initial role.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has sharply criticized Democrats for their negotiating stance during the ongoing government shutdown, labeling their actions as "hostage-taking." The impasse, now in its twelfth day, centers on Democrats' demand to extend expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for funding the government. Vance asserted that the administration will not negotiate under these terms, urging Democrats to reopen the government before discussing healthcare policy. The political stalemate continues with both sides blaming each other, while thousands of federal workers have begun receiving layoff notices.</p>

          <p>Stylesville Barbershop & Beauty Salon, the oldest Black-owned business in Los Angeles, has been honored with a landmark plaque by the city. Opened in 1957 by Freddie and Ollie Carter in the Pacoima neighborhood, the shop served as a vital social and cultural hub for the African American community during an era of segregation. The ceremony celebrated the Carter family's decades of service and their role in the community's development. Now run by the founders' grandson, the barbershop stands as a protected piece of history and a symbol of Black endurance and preservation in the San Fernando Valley.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez appeared at Marion County Jail for booking procedures, his first time seen in public since being stabbed in an altercation earlier this month. Sanchez, with his right arm in a sling, stated he is "recovering slowly" and expressed gratitude to the first responders and the surgeon who he credited with saving his life. He was arrested and charged following a fight with a truck driver, in which both men were injured and hospitalized. Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is scheduled for his next court date in November.</p>

          <p>The deployment of Border Patrol agents in major US cities far from the border is raising concerns among human rights advocates and legal experts. These agents, traditionally focused on rural border areas, are now part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan, leading to worries about their aggressive tactics being applied in urban communities. Incidents in Chicago and Los Angeles have highlighted the agents' confrontational methods, which critics argue are ill-suited for civil immigration enforcement. This expansion of their operational range is seen as a significant shift in federal immigration strategy, utilizing the agency's large force to supplement ICE operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a phenomenon called "workslop," where AI-generated content appears competent but lacks the substance to be useful, ultimately harming productivity. The Harvard Business Review article reports that over 40% of U.S. employees have received such content, which masquerades as good work. While AI technology is often blamed, the article argues that the responsibility lies with employers who fail to provide proper training, policies, and a clear strategy for AI implementation. Effective use of AI as a tool requires investment in the people using it, not just the software itself.</p>

China's commerce ministry stated that such threats are not a proper way to conduct relations and that while China does not want a trade war, it is not afraid of one. The threat from the US, which also includes new controls on critical software, came in response to China's restrictions on rare-earth material exports, a move that has already unsettled global financial markets.</p>
