          <p>In a detailed interview, Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson discusses the immense pressure and emotional toll of the Bryan Kohberger case, which resulted in four life sentences for the 2022 University of Idaho student murders. Thompson explains the strategic decision to accept a plea deal without requiring a full confession, arguing that any statement from Kohberger would likely be self-serving and further traumatize the victims' families. He reflects on the overwhelming evidence, including a crucial DNA match from a knife sheath, which he believes secured justice and provided closure. Thompson concludes with a final, stark message for the convicted murderer: "Goodbye and good riddance."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean "Diddy" Combs' request for bail, ensuring he will remain incarcerated until his October sentencing for transportation to engage in prostitution. The judge cited Combs as a flight risk and a danger to the community, referencing 2016 surveillance footage showing him violently assaulting Cassie Ventura. The court rejected the defense's argument that Combs' participation in a "swingers lifestyle" warranted his release, stating the case involved clear evidence of violence and coercion. Combs has been held at a Brooklyn federal jail for 11 months following his conviction by a jury.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest U.S. employment report has raised economic concerns, showing weaker-than-expected job growth in July and significant downward revisions for the previous two months. Experts suggest that uncertainty from trade tariffs is causing businesses to delay hiring and investment, leading to a stagnant labor market where new job creation is minimal. While sectors like healthcare saw gains, key areas such as manufacturing experienced job losses, challenging the administration's promises of a manufacturing revival. The data points to a precarious economic situation where prolonged uncertainty could escalate from a hiring slowdown to more widespread layoffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the controversial dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, experts clarify that revisions to monthly jobs reports are a standard and necessary part of the process. Former officials explain that initial reports are released quickly for timeliness but are based on incomplete survey responses. The BLS later revises these figures as more data becomes available, improving the accuracy of the final count. While the recent downward adjustment was larger than usual for a non-recessionary period, it is not evidence of manipulation but rather a reflection of a well-established methodology designed to balance speed with precision in economic reporting.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest as he stands trial for allegedly orchestrating a coup attempt after his 2022 election loss. The presiding justice, Alexandre de Moraes, ruled that Bolsonaro had violated previous precautionary measures by posting prohibited content on his sons' social media accounts. In addition to house arrest, the court has banned Bolsonaro from receiving most visitors and ordered the seizure of his mobile phones. This decision marks a significant development in the ongoing legal proceedings against the former leader for his actions challenging the election results.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at an unofficial afterparty for the Hard Summer music festival in downtown Los Angeles resulted in two deaths and six injuries early Monday morning. Police had initially responded to the large gathering hours earlier and made one arrest, but were called back to the scene after reports of gunfire. A 29-year-old man died at the location, and a woman later died at the hospital. The mayor of Los Angeles condemned the senseless violence, confirming that an investigation is underway and that gang interventionists are supporting the victims' families. No suspect or motive has been identified yet.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a proposal to reverse a Biden-era policy, aiming to block the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from providing abortions and related counseling.

The administration's filing argues the existing rule is legally questionable and inconsistent with federal funding restrictions.

During that previous walkout, several of the lawmakers contracted COVID-19 before eventually returning to Texas, where the bill was passed.

Beyond his famous collaborations with rock and country stars, the article highlights his often-overlooked political engagement and use of humor to address serious issues like immigration. It focuses on his 1976 performance of "Un Mojado Sin Licencia" ("A Wetback Without a License"), a song that defiantly finds joy and resilience in the face of xenophobia. The author argues that Jiménez's genius was in using his rollicking music not for pity, but as a powerful, joyful revolt against oppression.</p>

This report gathers perspectives from journalists in different countries, detailing how nations are responding to the levies and assessing the potential economic impact. The move follows an ambitious but unfulfilled promise to secure numerous trade deals, instead culminating in widespread tariffs. The global response underscores the significant disruption the administration's trade policies are causing for both allies and competitors, who are now forced to navigate a more protectionist U.S. stance.

          <p>Right-wing commentator Candace Owens claims that former President Donald Trump personally called her to ask her to stop promoting a debunked conspiracy theory that Brigitte Macron, the first lady of France, is a man. Owens, who is being sued for defamation by the Macrons, alleged that French President Emmanuel Macron made the request to Trump directly during a visit to Washington. According to Owens, Trump conveyed that the claims were deeply affecting Mrs. Macron but also told Owens, "I saw her up close and she looks like a woman to me."

          <p>A new report from Circulate San Diego argues that complex, multi-layered permitting requirements are a major cause of delays and budget overruns for California's transit projects, including the high-speed rail. These rules, originally created decades ago to prevent unchecked highway construction from destroying neighborhoods, have now become significant hurdles for building beneficial public transit. The report highlights how multiple jurisdictions and agencies must sign off on projects, creating opportunities for prolonged disputes and increased costs. It suggests adopting models from Canada, where time limits on external approvals could help streamline the process for essential infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack has warned that U.S. consumers may soon face higher inflation as businesses begin to pass on the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs. In an interview, Hammack explained that many companies have so far absorbed these costs by selling off stockpiled inventory, but are now facing squeezed profit margins. She noted a "two-speed economy" where high-income households are thriving while lower-income families struggle with rising costs for essentials. The Fed official expressed concern that inflation could reach 3% this year, posing a challenge to the central bank's dual mandate of controlling inflation and maintaining low unemployment.

The scheme also involved fraudulently obtaining nearly $900,000 in federal pandemic aid.

          <p>New scientific research proposes an unusual dietary source to explain the exceptionally high nitrogen values observed in the remains of Neanderthals. The study suggests that Neanderthals may have consumed meat that was infested with maggots, which are rich in nitrogen. This consumption, whether intentional or accidental, could account for the distinct chemical signature found in their bones that has long puzzled archaeologists. This theory offers a new perspective on the dietary habits and survival strategies of our ancient relatives, potentially solving a long-standing paleoanthropological mystery through a squirmy but plausible explanation.</p>
