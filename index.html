          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has shared a theory that the recent Blue Origin space flight, which featured an all-female crew including Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, was actually filmed using green screen technology. O'Neal cited discrepancies in a video released by Blue Origin, such as the luxurious hair of the crew members not moving in space and the key to the landing module already in the open position. O'Neal jokingly suggested the flight was filmed at Universal Studios, but Blue Origin has not yet responded to a request for comment. The article also mentions that several celebrities attended the event, including Oprah, and that Katy Perry described the experience as "second to being a mom."</p>

          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is not fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, starting June 1. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson stated the agency is about 80-85% ready, aiming for 97-98% soon. The review cites staffing limitations, hiring issues, and poor coordination with states as factors impacting readiness. Richardson emphasized the intent for the 2025 disaster season is to safeguard Americans, prioritize state responses, and coordinate federal assistance when necessary. The article notes sinking morale at FEMA since the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested eliminating the agency, and Richardson has urged employees not to obstruct the president's objectives.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who condemned the Gaza war in his commencement speech, accusing the U.S. of supporting "genocide". An NYU spokesperson stated that Rozos lied about the content of his speech to express personal political views, for which the university "strongly denounces" his remarks. Rozos, identifying as an "actor, artist, and gay Black trans man," accused the U.S. of politically and militarily supporting the "genocide currently occurring" in Gaza. NYU is one of ten universities under investigation by the Trump administration for alleged antisemitism on campus since the start of the Israel-Gaza war in October 2023.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration fired nearly 600 employees, mostly journalists, at Voice of America, a federally funded news network that provides independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. The layoffs amounted to over a third of the organization‚Äôs staff, signaling a continuation of efforts to dismantle the broadcaster despite a court ruling ordering the federal government to maintain robust news programming. Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, described the firings as ‚Äúinexplicable,‚Äù while Kari Lake, a senior adviser at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, stated that the administration acted within its legal authority to reduce the federal bureaucracy. Some terminated journalists are from countries with repressive governments, and they now face leaving the United States by the end of June.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered significant deals to sell advanced AI chips from Nvidia and AMD to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, leading to internal divisions within the government. While some officials believe these deals will boost American AI companies and expand U.S. influence, others worry about potential risks, including the technology benefiting China and the relocation of major data centers to the Middle East. The agreements follow reports of substantial financial flows from the Middle East to Trump-related businesses, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. The deals involve security guarantees and reciprocal investment requirements, but the long-term implications and enforceability of these agreements remain uncertain.</p>

The bill includes extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, new tax breaks for businesses, and temporary tax cuts on tips and overtime. It also introduces stricter work requirements for Medicaid, reduces clean energy tax credits, and scales back the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The plan faces internal Republican divisions over Medicaid cuts and state and local tax deductions, as well as criticism from Democrats who argue it favors the rich at the expense of the poor.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, when a land bridge connected the two continents due to lower sea levels. Researchers analyzed fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, and found genetic evidence of multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago. These Dalianensis horses, which lived 17,000 years ago, were slightly larger than existing wild horses and had mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations.

Conversely, during Trump's second term, cases have increasingly landed before judges in Massachusetts, a blue district with a liberal appeals court. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction.</p>

          <h2>Maryland Medical Examiners Misclassified Deaths in Police Custody, Audit Finds</h2>

          <p>A report released by Maryland officials reveals that medical examiners miscategorized dozens of deaths that occurred in police custody over the past two decades, with at least 36 deaths incorrectly classified as accidental or natural causes instead of homicides. The audit, prompted by the police killing of George Floyd, found evidence of racism and pro-police bias, with Black individuals and those who died after being restrained by police being less likely to have their deaths classified as homicides. The report also noted the frequent use of "excited delirium" as a cause of death in these cases. Governor Wes Moore has directed the attorney general to determine whether any cases warrant criminal charges.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Decision to Lift Syria Sanctions Surprises Treasury Staff</h2>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The lack of specifics regarding which measures would be rolled back and at what pace left Treasury scrambling to understand the president's intentions. The announcement came as a relief to Syria's transitional government, which has been lobbying for sanctions relief. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision had been discussed for weeks and that the administration will implement the president's announcement. Some work was underway at Treasury before the announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies have negatively impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had previously warned of a likely moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policy effects. Despite these concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate, citing the country's inflation rate surpassing the 2% target.</p>

          <p>More than 60,000 disabled households in England faced homelessness last year, marking a nearly 75% increase since 2019, according to official figures. Analysis of government data by the charity Crisis also reveals a decline in the amount of social housing allocated to disabled people. Labour MP Paula Barker has expressed concern over planned cuts to disability benefits, warning against going "further and faster in the wrong direction". The government has stated that ¬£1bn is being provided to councils this year to "support families faster and stop people becoming homeless in the first place."</p>

          <p>Small business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, has been struggling to stay afloat amid the changing tariff policies imposed by the Trump administration. Djavaheri faced a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, resulting in significant duty tax bills, but this tariff was later reduced to 30%. This financial instability has forced Djavaheri to increase prices and rush orders for the holiday season, while also dealing with tripled shipping prices. The situation highlights the dilemma faced by many U.S. businesses, who must navigate constantly changing tariffs and attempt to remain profitable.</p>

          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, has lost his appeal against a landmark defamation judgement that found he committed war crimes. A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging the Victoria Cross recipient had murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Roberts-Smith argued the judge made legal errors. The civil trial was the first time a court assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces. A panel of three Federal Court judges upheld the original verdict, and Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence, though he has not been charged in a criminal court.</p>

The bill passed the first stage of the Commons last November, but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides. Friday's debate comes as the government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law. It reduced its upper estimate for the number of assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647.</p>
