          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel's career spanned decades, beginning in 1970 when he was elected to Congress, eventually becoming the dean of New York's congressional delegation. Despite facing an ethics violation that led to his censure, he remained a powerful voice for Harlem and played a key role in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate. The article highlights his influence as a politician who championed economic development and social justice, even though he sometimes faced criticism for being too pragmatic.</p>

          <p>The UK government is shifting apprenticeship funding to prioritize individuals under 21 in England, creating 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults. This change involves pulling funding from level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to postgraduate degrees, impacting various roles including those in the NHS. While the government aims to boost entry-level apprenticeships, critics argue that this decision will harm public services and limit professional opportunities for young people not attending university.</p>

          <p>Online travel booking data indicates that tourists from countries heavily impacted by President Trump's trade tariffs are increasingly avoiding travel to the United States. Trivago's findings reveal double-digit percentage declines in bookings from Japan, Canada, and Mexico, while Germany also shows decreased demand. Concerns over economic uncertainty are also driving UK and US travelers towards domestic holidays, suggesting a "Trump slump" is affecting the tourism industry.</p>

On May 22, the Trump administration announced plans to halt the university’s ability to enroll international students, cutting off a major revenue stream for one of the nation’s oldest and wealthiest institutions. In an appearance on Fox Business, the celebrity investor — who also teaches at Harvard Business School — was asked what he makes of the Trump administration’s “strong move against Harvard.” O’Leary pushed back on it, saying his students don’t hate America.
