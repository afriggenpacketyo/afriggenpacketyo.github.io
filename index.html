          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, potentially boosting the city's virtual asset hub ambitions. The municipal Public Security Bureau in Beijing is partnering with the China Beijing Equity Exchange to sell seized cryptoassets through regulated platforms in Hong Kong, converting proceeds into yuan. This marks the first instance of a mainland agency detailing a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets within Hong Kongâ€™s virtual asset regime. Mainland China enforces a strict ban on crypto trading, making the handling of seized assets complex, with billions of dollars in crypto awaiting disposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts are questioning Apple's AI strategy as the company's initial efforts with Apple Intelligence have been underwhelming compared to competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. Investors are eager to see how Apple plans to catch up in the rapidly transforming tech industry, especially as some executives suggest AI could eventually replace the iPhone. Apple Intelligence's initial features were criticized, and a key improvement to Siri was delayed, leading to class-action suits. Apple may need to acquire a company or partner with others to bolster its AI capabilities, though the company possesses advantages in chip design and unified memory.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates to 20%, the first cut since September 2022, indicating a decrease in inflation pressures. The rate had been at 21% since October, the highest since 2013, while the inflation rate in April was 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter. The central bank noted that the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path, though monetary policy will remain tight to reach the 4% inflation target. Despite ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the ruble has been the world's best-performing currency this year, attributed to capital controls and policy tightening. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police are investigating whether the sexual orientation of Jonathan Joss, known for his voice work on "King of the Hill," played a role in his fatal shooting. Joss's husband alleges the shooter yelled homophobic slurs before opening fire, though initial police statements downplayed this possibility. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus has since walked back the initial statement, confirming that it is now part of the investigation. Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, a neighbor with whom Joss reportedly had a long-standing feud, has been charged with murder and is out on bond, and the community remembers Joss as a talented actor and advocate.</p>

The judge appeared to reconsider the sale of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, potentially delaying the process further. Jones declared bankruptcy after being found liable for defamation for spreading false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook shooting, leading to years of harassment for the families.</p>

          <p>New details have emerged regarding the death of Jonathan Joss, with his husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, alleging it was an anti-gay hate crime. The couple's neighbor, Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, has been charged with first-degree murder after confessing to the shooting. Gonzales claims that Alvarez shouted violent homophobic slurs during the incident, and the couple had previously experienced harassment from neighbors. Police initially stated there was no evidence of a hate crime, but have since retracted that statement, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As stablecoins move towards mainstream adoption, certain segments of the U.S. Treasury market, particularly short-term securities, could face volatility. Congressional legislation establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins is expected to legitimize these cryptocurrencies. While proponents believe this will boost the market for short-term U.S. government debt, others worry that a larger role for stablecoins could introduce instability. Concerns exist that a loss of confidence or regulatory pressure could trigger large-scale liquidations, impacting Treasury prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The author also suggests the party reconsider its immigration policies and environmentalism, arguing that they negatively affect American breadwinners.
