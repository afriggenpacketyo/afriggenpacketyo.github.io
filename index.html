          <p>The article discusses the potential impact of a government shutdown on the U.S. military, noting that active-duty service members would continue to serve without pay until a funding deal is reached. A shutdown would delay pay for active-duty personnel and require civilian personnel deemed essential to continue working, while others would be furloughed. Contingency plans prioritize operations like securing the southern border and Middle East operations, but medical and dental care would be maintained, while elective procedures would be delayed. The article also mentions that financial institutions may offer special loans to military members during the shutdown. Optimism around the situation may be limited due to the challenges faced by military personnel. </p>

          <h2>ACA Tax Credit Expiration Looms Amid Government Shutdown Concerns</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article centers on the potential expiration of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits for 22 million Americans and its connection to the government shutdown drama. Democratic lawmakers are pushing for an extension of these enhanced premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of 2025, as part of any funding deal. The expiration could lead to a significant increase in premiums, potentially causing millions to lose coverage, with insurers already preparing notices of premium hikes. Consumers are advised to compare plans and explore options like Health Savings Plans to mitigate financial surprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explains the potential government shutdown and its causes, highlighting the disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over funding. Republicans are pushing for a short-term funding bill, while Democrats are demanding extensions of ACA subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid cuts. This year's threat is considered more serious due to potential permanent layoffs of government workers, adding to previous workforce reductions. The effects of a shutdown could include furloughs, disruptions to federal services, and potential economic impacts. </p>

          <p>Laura Muir's former coach, Andrew Young, has been banned for three years for "serious misconduct," including ignoring medical advice and using manipulative behavior towards athletes. The ban, backdated to April 2023, was reduced from five years after an appeal. The disciplinary panel found that Young had driven at speed with an athlete in his car before abandoning them at the roadside, and required an athlete to compete against the clear advice of a physiotherapist, among other things. Muir has stated that she has put this chapter behind her. </p>

The article notes that TikTok has been successful around the world, not because it is particularly sensitive to foreign societal norms but because, by growing so big so fast, it could disregard them. It also highlights the fact that TikTok has painted a target on its back due to its pervasive influence in American culture, especially among younger people, and the fact that it is Chinese-owned made Washington’s antagonism inevitable. It is a dominant cultural influence within the vast Hispanic community, just as TikTok has become among young Americans.</p>
