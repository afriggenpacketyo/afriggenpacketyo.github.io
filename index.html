          <p>A significant cyberattack has disrupted a widely used electronic check-in and baggage system, causing extensive delays at major European airports including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack targeted the Muse software from Collins Aerospace, forcing airlines to revert to manual processing and leading to long queues and frustrated passengers. Officials are investigating the incident, which highlights the vulnerability of interconnected aviation infrastructure to digital threats, though the perpetrators' motives remain unknown. The disruption has caused hundreds of flight delays and some cancellations across the continent.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the new, thinner iPhone Air exemplifies a pervasive and uninspired trend of minimalism that is making culture more sterile and less expressive. The author contrasts modern, spartan design with the bold, colorful aesthetics of past technology like the 1998 iMac, suggesting that today's minimalism reflects a desire for control in a chaotic world. This trend is observed not just in technology but also in interior design, restaurants, and even theater, stripping away context and personality. The piece contends that this aesthetic of scarcity ultimately leaves people feeling hollow and disconnected.</p>

          <p>A protest against immigration policies in The Hague, Netherlands, escalated into violence, prompting police to use tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd. Demonstrators, some associated with far-right groups, threw rocks and bottles at police and damaged the office of a centrist political party. The unrest occurs just over a month before the country's snap general election, which was called after a dispute over migration policy collapsed the previous government. Political leaders, including far-right figure Geert Wilders, have condemned the violence.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight aerial assault across nine regions of Ukraine, killing at least three people and injuring more than 30, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The attacks, which utilized hundreds of drones and missiles, struck civilian infrastructure and a residential building in what Zelensky called a deliberate strategy to intimidate the population. In response, Ukrainian drones targeted key Russian industrial facilities, reportedly hitting major oil refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions. The cross-border strikes highlight the escalating nature of the conflict as both sides target critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, President Trump is being accused of exploiting the tragedy to launch a campaign against his political adversaries. The administration is escalating threats against the "radical left," considering classifying some groups as domestic terrorists, and seeking to undermine the Democratic party, despite no evidence linking them to the killing. Critics warn that this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, using a violent act as a pretext to suppress dissent and erode civil liberties. The White House insists its focus is on preventing violence, but the rhetoric has raised concerns about the weaponization of state power.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position following reported pressure from the Trump administration to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that after a five-month investigation into alleged mortgage fraud, investigators found insufficient evidence to charge James, a prominent political rival of the president. President Trump publicly stated he wanted Siebert "out" and later claimed to have fired him. The move is seen by critics as an attack on the rule of law and an escalation of a retribution campaign against political opponents.</p>

Meanwhile, international pressure on Israel is mounting, with a UN conference on a two-state solution scheduled for next week.

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law granting the government sweeping emergency powers typically reserved for wartime, to address the nation's asylum application backlog. The plan involves setting up temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite claims and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. This proposal was announced at the party's annual conference as part of a focus on law and order. The government's current goal is to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.</p>

          <p>Following his death, right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is being portrayed as a martyr by Christian nationalists, a movement that grew in parallel with his own political career. Religious leaders and followers are framing his killing as a "holy war" and a catalyst to become more bold in their "spiritual battle" against the left. The article traces Kirk's evolution from a secular young Republican to an advocate for a strident Christian culture war, mirroring the Christian right's shift toward more extreme, anti-democratic ideas during the Trump era. His death is now being used to galvanize support and intensify the movement's sense of righteous struggle.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from closing its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising new "golden share" rights. These powers, which grant the White House veto authority over strategic decisions, were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. After the company informed nearly 800 workers of the impending closure, the Commerce Secretary reportedly warned the CEO that the administration would not permit it, forcing U.S. Steel to reverse its decision. This marks the first use of these rights and signals a more interventionist approach to the private sector.</p>

Lewinsky reflected on how the cultural landscape has shifted, particularly for younger generations and in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which helped re-contextualize her experience as an abuse of power.

While SPF in sunscreen measures protection against UVB rays that cause sunburn, it doesn't account for UVA rays, which are linked to accelerated skin aging and cancer. Because UVA rays are not filtered by clouds or standard glass, people can be exposed without realizing it. The expert recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily to protect against both types of harmful ultraviolet radiation.</p>

          <p>Deep divisions have emerged within the UK's new left-wing party, "Your Party," as MP Zarah Sultana has accused former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his allies of making "baseless attacks" on her character. The dispute centers around a membership portal launched by Sultana, which Corbyn's faction claimed was "unauthorised." Sultana, who has now instructed defamation lawyers, alleges she was sidelined by a "sexist boys' club." The public row reveals a significant power struggle within the fledgling party, which was launched in July and aims to unite independent left-wing MPs.</p>

          <h2>Experts Identify Tariffs, Climate Change, and Labor Shortages as Key Drivers of Rising U.S. Grocery Bills</h2>

          <p>American consumers are facing higher grocery bills, with food prices rising at the fastest monthly rate since 2022. According to food industry analysts, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods like coffee, the effects of climate change disrupting domestic agriculture, and a shortage of farm workers in the U.S. These pressures increase costs for producers, who then pass them on to consumers through higher prices or "shrinkflation," where package sizes are reduced. Shoppers are adapting by seeking deals and buying store brands to manage their budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a counterintuitive market reaction, long-term interest rates, including those for mortgages, increased this week despite the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark short-term rate. Bond traders reportedly viewed the Fed's move as a "sell the news" event and expressed concern that easing monetary policy while inflation remains above target could be risky. This selling pressure on long-term bonds caused their prices to fall and their yields to rise. The development highlights a disconnect between the Fed's actions and the sentiment of the broader bond market, potentially impacting costs for mortgages and other long-term loans.

          <p>Dairy farmers in Vermont are facing significant hardship due to a severe and prolonged drought that has stunted the growth of essential feed crops like corn and grass. With diminished harvests, farmers are forced to spend thousands of dollars on supplemental feed to maintain the health and milk production of their cattle. Some have also had to resort to hauling water as their wells run dry. The situation threatens the profitability of the state's vital dairy industry, which accounts for over half of its agricultural sales, as farmers grapple with extreme and unpredictable weather patterns.</p>
