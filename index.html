          <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is visiting Washington to advocate for the transfer of long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, a move he claims has prompted Russian President Putin to agree to a meeting with Donald Trump. While Trump has publicly considered the transfer, he has also expressed concerns about depleting U.S. stockpiles. The potential deployment of these powerful weapons, which have a range of up to 1,500 miles, is seen as a significant tactical escalation that could alter the battlefield dynamics, though the U.S. currently has limited land-based launchers available for them.</p>

          <p>At the World Conference on China Studies in Shanghai, prominent Chinese academics have called for a shift away from applying Western theoretical frameworks to the study of China. Scholars like Lin Shangli, president of Renmin University, argued that Western logic and knowledge systems are inadequate for explaining China's unique development and governance structures. They advocated for a tailored approach grounded in the country's specific context and supported by extensive field research to provide a more accurate and deeper understanding.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former national security adviser John Bolton on charges of unlawfully transmitting and retaining classified documents. The indictment alleges Bolton used personal email to send top-secret information to unauthorized individuals, identified as his relatives, and improperly stored sensitive materials at his home. Bolton has denied the charges, framing them as political retribution orchestrated by President Trump, and stated he looks forward to defending his conduct in court.</p>

The article details the complex investigation, the trial that convicted the boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, and the journalist's exclusive, challenging interview with Snyder, who was a central figure in the case but never charged.</p>

Undercover officers infiltrated their online group, leading to their arrests before an attack could be carried out, with the judge noting they continue to hold their extremist views.</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament are pressuring the Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, to provide a fuller explanation for why a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China was dropped. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) blamed the collapse on the government's failure to provide sufficient evidence proving China was a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. This has sparked a public dispute, with the government releasing witness statements to counter the CPS's claims, prompting parliamentary inquiries into the matter.</p>

According to political analyst Tia Mitchell, this behavior is consistent with Greene's hard-right, populist values, which have remained constant while the Republican party leadership has shifted to align more closely with Trump. Greene's willingness to disagree with the party line on certain issues reflects her consistent adherence to her original political principles.</p>

          <p>The death of Isak Andic, the 71-year-old founder of the Mango clothing chain, is now being investigated as a possible homicide, with Spanish media reporting his son, Jonathan, has been named a suspect. Andic died in December after a fall while hiking with his son in the Montserrat mountains, a death initially ruled accidental. However, authorities have reportedly re-examined the case due to "inconsistent" testimony from Jonathan, who was the only witness to the incident.</p>

          <p>As U.S. President Trump prepares to host Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, plans for a subsequent summit with Russian President Putin in Budapest are facing diplomatic hurdles. German officials have reminded Hungary of its obligation as a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to arrest Putin, who is under an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes. Hungarian officials, however, have asserted their sovereignty and assured Russia that Putin can enter the country without issue for the peace-focused talks.</p>

          <p>Despite the Dodgers' success in the postseason, two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani has been in a significant hitting slump, batting just .103 across the NLDS and NLCS. As he takes the mound for a crucial Game 4 start against the Brewers, there is anticipation that he could break out of his slump and make history. If Ohtani were to hit a home run while also being the winning pitcher, it would be a feat the legendary Babe Ruth never accomplished in a postseason game.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that nine months after the Eaton and Palisades fires, a large majority of affected residents in Altadena and Pacific Palisades have not been able to return home.

          <p>The Malibu City Council has declared a state of emergency over wildfire risk, directing the Sheriff's Office to remove and, if necessary, arrest homeless individuals engaged in unpermitted camping. Citing over 30 fires believed to have been started by homeless individuals since 2021, city officials argue the measure is crucial for public safety in the fire-prone region. The move creates a potential policy conflict, as the L.A. County Sheriff's Office generally avoids criminalizing homelessness, though proponents point to a recent Supreme Court decision allowing cities to enforce anti-camping laws.</p>

          <p>California has successfully navigated its second summer in a row without issuing a single "Flex Alert" for energy conservation, a significant shift from its history of rolling blackouts. Experts and state officials attribute this newfound grid stability to the massive expansion of battery energy storage, which has grown over 3,000% since 2020. This technology allows the state to store solar power generated during the day and deploy it during peak evening hours, reducing reliance on fossil-fuel "peaker" plants and marking a major milestone in its transition to clean energy.</p>

          <p>Marketers are leveraging the public's interest in stem cell science to sell a plethora of dietary supplements on platforms like Amazon, making unsubstantiated claims about their benefits. A recent study by Canadian researchers found that these products often use vague, pseudoscientific language to suggest they can enhance the body's own stem cells for anti-aging or cognitive improvement. These promotions operate within the weak regulatory framework of the U.S. supplement industry, which allows them to avoid making direct, illegal claims of curing diseases while still misleading consumers.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has successfully steered the Trump administration's policy on Venezuela from initial cooperation towards a more aggressive, confrontational stance. By framing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as a "narco-kingpin" fueling crime and migration in the U.S., Rubio has aligned his long-standing goal of toppling leftist regimes with Trump's domestic priorities. This shift has led to U.S. military strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug boats and has brought the two nations to the brink of military conflict.</p>

          <p>A preliminary hearing has revealed disturbing new details about the September 2023 murder of Los Angeles model Maleesa Mooney, who was two months pregnant when her body was found bound and gagged inside her refrigerator. Prosecutors presented evidence that Magnus Humphrey, who had known Mooney for less than a week, tortured and killed her, leaving her body in a state of "homicidal violence." Humphrey's defense argued the evidence was thin, but a judge ruled he will stand trial for the murder.</p>
