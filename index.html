          <p>India launched missile strikes into Pakistan, targeting what it described as nine sites of terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, labeling the operation "Sindoor". Pakistan's army confirmed the attacks, stating they responded from both air and ground and reported casualties, while India claimed no military facilities were targeted. President Trump called the escalation a "shame," and the State Department is monitoring the situation. The strikes follow a deadly attack in Kashmir, with India blaming Pakistan for its involvement, escalating tensions between the two nations. Optimism Score: 35</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported better-than-expected first fiscal-quarter earnings but announced a projected $700 million revenue loss in the current quarter due to new export controls on AI chips to China. Despite these regulatory challenges, AMD CEO Lisa Su highlighted the company's strong product portfolio and tailwinds in other areas. The company's data center segment, driven by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, saw significant growth. AMD expects continued investment in AI infrastructure and its chips are being used to train AI, and a major AI model developer is using AMD chips to deploy their service, a process called inference.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a widely recognized energy efficiency certification, as part of an agency-wide reorganization. Internal documents and recordings reveal that divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency will be deprioritized, including the office managing Energy Star. This program, which has been in place for 33 years, has helped households and businesses save billions in energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The decision faces criticism from energy efficiency advocates who argue it contradicts the administration's pledge to reduce household costs and address the growing energy crisis.

CEO Charles Liang cited customer hesitation due to the transition between current and upcoming GPUs and uncertainty related to tariffs for not providing fiscal year 2026 guidance.

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement designed to ease exports for UK firms and cut taxes on Indian exports. The British government touts the deal as the "biggest and most economically significant" bilateral trade agreement since leaving the European Union. Tariffs will be lowered or removed on various goods, including whisky, cars, clothing, and foodstuffs. The agreement also includes provisions on services and procurement, with some Indian and British workers gaining a three-year exemption from social security payments. Optimism Score: 70</p>

Some florists are trying to absorb the costs, while others may need to raise prices or source more local flowers. Optimism Score: 65</p>
