        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government, under President Trump, facilitated a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, aiming to end the conflict in eastern DRC over mineral wealth. The deal, initialed by officials and set to be signed in Washington, seeks to bring American investment into the region, rich in minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. Critics are skeptical of the agreement's success, as the M23 rebel group, believed to be backed by Rwanda, was not a signatory. The agreement's success hinges on M23's compliance and Rwanda's willingness to withdraw support, potentially transforming the geopolitical landscape of African crisis resolution and countering China's dominance in the DRC's mineral sector. The deal is expected to be finalized in Washington.</p>

          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes starting in December 2026 to reduce environmental harm, making it the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The motion passed in the Senedd includes an exemption for medical-grade wipes and does not extend to business-to-business supply. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the need to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products, noting the tangible and long-lasting impact of wet wipe pollution. Research from Cardiff University revealed that significant quantities of wet wipes enter Welsh river systems annually, highlighting the importance of preventing improper disposal.</p>

          <p>An analyst close to the Iranian regime, Hamidreza Gholamzadeh, acknowledged that Iran's power in the region has been weakened following Israeli attacks, but insisted that Iranians remain united against Israel. Gholamzadeh downplayed the possibility of internal unrest, claiming that only a small percentage of Iranians would actively participate in activities against the government. However, independent surveys conducted before the current war indicated significant opposition to the cleric-led regime. Gholamzadeh also repeated warnings against U.S. involvement in the conflict, noting the vulnerability of American military bases in the region, while President Trump has warned of a swift response to any Iranian attack on American assets. The remarks from the analyst come during heightened tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for a further 90 days, marking the third such delay. The video-sharing app's future has been uncertain since the US passed a law requiring its ban unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns. Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order to delay the law's enforcement, prompting a statement from TikTok expressing gratitude for his support in keeping the app available for its US users. The extension provides additional time for negotiations regarding the app's ownership and operation.</p>

          <p>The office of US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, requested “a passive approach to Juneteenth messaging,” according to a Rolling Stone report citing a Pentagon email. This directive comes amid Donald Trump’s attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across government, including the US military, which Hegseth has enthusiastically executed. Hegseth has continued to espouse anti-DEI talking points, claiming without evidence that these policies put military service members in harm’s way. In response to Rolling Stone’s request for comment, the Pentagon said that the Department of Defense “may engage in the following activities, subject to applicable department guidance: holiday celebrations that build camaraderie and esprit de corps; outreach events (eg, recruiting engagements with all-male, all-female, or minority-serving academic institutions) where doing so directly supports DoD’s mission; and recognition of historical events and notable figures where such recognition informs strategic thinking, reinforces our unity, and promotes meritocracy and accountability”.</p>

The ban is the latest development in a confrontation between the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and the LGBTQ community, with legal backing from the courts. Orban had previously announced that Pride would not take place this year, citing a law restricting gatherings that violate child protection laws on public promotion of homosexuality. Karacsony argues that the police have no right to ban a "Day of Freedom" organized by the city council, as it does not fall under the rules on freedom of assembly.</p>

          <p>As tensions rise between Iran and Israel, questions arise about the UK's potential role in the conflict, given its close alliance with the US. While Britain has called for de-escalation, Israel reportedly did not inform the UK of its attack on Iran, considering it "not a reliable partner." The UK still has a diplomatic role, joining European allies in talks with Iran, and possesses military assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base and RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. The potential use of these assets, particularly in striking Iran's nuclear program, depends on UK government approval and adherence to international law.</p>

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez informed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte of his country's opposition in a letter, stating that Madrid would not commit to a specific spending target at the upcoming NATO summit. Spain's government believes that the existing NATO target of 2% of GDP is realistic, and that the process should involve determining capabilities before setting a percentage. Spain's military expenditure is around 1.3% of GDP, but the government plans to achieve the 2% target this year by spending an additional €10.5 billion.</p>

The curfew, enacted in response to protests against immigration policies, led to boarded-up storefronts and a significant drop in reservations. While the curfew has been lifted, the lingering impact on business is evident, with restaurants like Kato experiencing a substantial decrease in bookings. Community organizations are urging support for downtown businesses, emphasizing that the area is safe and that misinformation about the protests has negatively affected the local economy.</p>

          <p>While a federal appeals court reviews the legality of deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles, immigration enforcement efforts have accelerated, causing widespread fear. Advocacy groups report that ICE raids are becoming faster and more discreet, with agents sometimes in plainclothes or wearing insignia from other agencies. Critics are likening the situation to a totalitarian regime, with stepped-up raids blamed on the city's policies limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement. A class action lawsuit challenges ICE officers allegedly posing as regular police, seeking to require them to wear more prominent insignia.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S., pushing back the deadline for the third time until mid-September. The move comes as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive, despite bipartisan concerns about national security. TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension, while lawmakers expressed concern about the continued delays and lack of action from Congress. The situation underscores the ongoing tension between national security concerns and the app's popularity among millions of American users.</p>

This includes gross domestic product, capital formation, exports of goods and services, foreign exchange, financial market volatility, and investor sentiment. While tariffs have led to some investment project announcements aimed at restructuring supply chains in manufacturing sectors, their main effect has been a dramatic increase in investor uncertainty. The pullback in FDI affects all developing countries and the relative opportunity they have to either enter into or expand participation in the global value chains and certainly in manufacturing sectors.

          <p>In an era marked by heightened polarization and easy offense, learning to be less offended can improve one's quality of life. Understanding the psychology behind taking offense, which involves identifying insults, assessing their severity, and responding emotionally, is the first step toward controlling reactions. Strategies to achieve this include laughing off minor offenses, using the prefrontal cortex to manage emotions, and tuning out offense-making media. Ultimately, managing one's own reactions to offense can lead to greater self-control and a more positive outlook.</p>

The prosecution says living and eating areas were outside, unprotected from the elements; toilets were filthy; showers were inadequate with only intermittent hot water; and the electrics were a safety hazard.
