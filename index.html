            <p>Prince Harry is appealing a decision to downgrade his police protection in the UK, arguing his safety is at risk. His barrister stated that Harry faces a 'manifestly inferior' security process compared to other royals, highlighting the 'unique circumstances' arising from his step back from royal duties in 2020 and relocation to California. The government defends its flexible approach to his security, citing the Royal and VIP Executive Committee's (Ravec) authority. The court is expected to issue a written decision at a later date; the case underscores the ongoing tensions between Harry's desire for security and his changed status. Optimism Score: 35</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the Trump administration's focus is now on Main Street businesses and consumers, after four decades of Wall Street's prosperity. He acknowledged concerns that new tariffs could lead to a recession, but emphasized the administration's commitment to tax cuts, deregulation, and trade rebalancing. Bessent outlined plans to de-leverage the government sector and re-leverage the private sector, while also mentioning potential tax reforms like no tax on tips or Social Security.

            <p>A U.S. judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's access to presidential events after the White House blocked the news agency in a dispute over the term "Gulf of America". District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled that the restriction violated the First Amendment, guaranteeing freedom of speech. The dispute arose after the AP refused to adopt the administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America" in its coverage, following an executive order by President Donald Trump. This ruling highlights ongoing tensions between the administration and the press.</p>

Trump views tariffs as a tool to revitalize US industry and counter China's economic and geopolitical influence.

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a volatile session, oscillating between gains and losses due to concerns about an escalating global trade war. China and the European Union have imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, exacerbating market uncertainty. The sell-off in U.S. Treasury markets added to the unease. President Trump's latest tariffs on China have increased the cumulative rate to 104%, prompting Beijing to respond with higher tariffs on U.S. goods (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Rex Heuermann, charged with the murders of several women found near Gilgo Beach, Long Island, has brought intense scrutiny to his family, particularly his wife, Asa Ellerup. Ellerup, who filed for divorce after Heuermann's arrest, claims she was unaware of her husband's alleged crimes. Investigators found hairs on some victims that are consistent with Ellerup's DNA profile. Though she is not a suspect, the case raises questions about the family's knowledge and involvement, and the devastating impact on their lives.</p>

            <p>Astronomers are hoping the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, currently under construction in Chile, will finally detect Planet Nine, a hypothetical giant planet believed to exist in the outer solar system. The observatory's powerful telescope and advanced imaging capabilities will survey the southern sky nightly, searching for faint objects and changes in orbital patterns. While the planet has not been spotted, there is hope that the facility will turn up new evidence. If it's out there, this telescope should find it, pretty easily.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's tariffs on the developing world could pressure countries in the Global South to choose between the US and China. Several developing economies now face additional tariffs, prompting most to seek deals with the US. China, now hit with a 104% tariff rate, has retaliated, vowing to 'fight to the end'. This situation poses a test for China's ties with the Global South, potentially reshaping geopolitical alliances.</p>

            <p>A former co-worker of Rex Heuermann, the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer, recounts an unnerving incident where he tracked her down on a cruise, stating, "I told you I could find you anywhere." Muriel Henriquez, who worked at Heuermann's architectural firm, also recalls receiving a sweater from him that his wife had brought back from Iceland. This detail is significant because the trip may have given Heuermann the opportunity to kill Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who disappeared that same summer. Heuermann is currently facing trial for several of the murders.</p>

            <p>Amid market volatility driven by trade war fears and economic uncertainty, investors are advised to focus on fundamentals rather than short-term price action. A "wide scales" approach, staggering buys at larger intervals, is recommended.

Financial stocks with strong balance sheets and growth potential, as well as technology companies with solid business models, are also highlighted (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The bond market is experiencing unusual volatility, with prices falling and yields spiking, despite growing fears of a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly rose above 4.5%, a level not seen since February, while the 30-year yield hit a high not seen since November 2023. President Trump's tariffs and the escalating trade war are contributing to the uncertainty, as investors typically seek the safety of bonds during economic downturns.

The move has rattled global markets, sparking fears of price increases and potential recession, although Trump maintains it will generate revenue and lead to trade deals.</p>
