          <p>Romania scrambled F-16 fighter jets after a Russian drone breached its airspace during attacks on neighboring Ukraine, marking the latest NATO member to report such an incident. Poland also elevated its military readiness, deploying aircraft in response to Russian drone activity near its border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described these incursions as a deliberate expansion of the war by Russia, calling for stronger Western sanctions and enhanced collective defense cooperation to counter the escalating threat. The events have placed the military alliance on high alert.</p>

          <p>The UK's financial regulator is proposing to allow banks to remove the £100 limit on contactless card payments, a move that academics warn could lead to increased impulsive spending and debt. While proponents argue it aligns card technology with the unlimited nature of smartphone payments, critics raise concerns about financial security and the potential for economic abuse. The debate highlights a tension between consumer convenience and the "friction" that PIN verification provides, with banks suggesting customers could set their own personal limits.</p>

          <p>Recently retired Chicago Cubs icon Anthony Rizzo shared a humorous moment with fans during a game at Wrigley Field. While enjoying the game from the left-field bleachers, Rizzo attempted to catch the first career home run ball hit by Cubs designated hitter Moisés Ballesteros. After fumbling the catch, he was seen joking, "That's why I'm retired," a lighthearted acknowledgment of his transition from player to team ambassador. Rizzo, a key member of the 2016 World Series championship team, had returned to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.</p>

          <h2>Trump Proposes NATO-Wide Ban on Russian Oil to End Ukraine War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 19:01:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has stated his readiness to impose significant sanctions on Russia, contingent upon all NATO members ceasing their purchases of Russian oil. He argued that continued oil buys, particularly by countries like Turkey, weaken the alliance's negotiating power and undermine efforts to end the war in Ukraine. This call for a unified economic front comes amid heightened tensions, including recent Russian drone incursions into the airspace of NATO members Poland and Romania, which the administration has called a dangerous development. Trump also suggested imposing heavy tariffs on China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he is prepared to enact "major sanctions" against Russia but only after all NATO allies agree to stop buying Russian oil. In a social media post, he framed the move as a necessary step to weaken Russia's bargaining power and cripple its war machine, criticizing some member states for their continued energy trade with Moscow. The president also urged the alliance to impose steep tariffs on China, claiming its economic influence over Russia could be leveraged to help conclude the conflict in Ukraine. This proposal aims to create a unified economic front among Western allies.</p>

          <p>German customs officials in Hamburg arrested two men after discovering more than 400 kilograms of cocaine hidden in over 20 sports bags. The seizure occurred at the O'Swaldkai container terminal when dock workers noticed the suspects, who were not port employees, loading the bags into a car from a ship. After being alerted, customs officers intervened, apprehending one suspect immediately and capturing the second after a search involving a police helicopter. The incident highlights Hamburg's role as a major entry point for narcotics into Europe.</p>

          <p>The long throw-in is re-emerging as a highly effective tactic in the Premier League, with Brentford FC leading the charge. The club has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, significantly more than any other team in the league, demonstrating the chaos it can create for defenses. Manager Keith Andrews has embraced the strategy, which was famously used by Stoke City's Rory Delap, as a legitimate way to gain a competitive advantage. The tactic's success challenges a perceived "snobbery" in football, proving that direct, disruptive plays can be just as valuable.</p>

          <p>An explosion, believed to have been caused by a gas leak, ripped through a bar in Madrid's Puente de Vallecas district, injuring at least 25 people. Emergency services reported that two of the victims were in serious condition, and firefighters had to pull four individuals from the rubble of the "Mis Tesoros" bar. The blast rendered the building unstable, forcing the evacuation and temporary rehousing of residents from the nine apartments above the establishment. Authorities have ruled out finding more victims trapped in the debris while investigating the cause.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, allowing approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar living in border camps to legally work in the country. This policy shift is a response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which have led to food shortages and rising malnutrition in the camps. The decision, welcomed by the UNHCR, aims to provide refugees with self-sufficiency and economic opportunities after decades of confinement. The move could also help fill labor shortages in Thailand's economy.</p>

          <p>The issue of Ukrainian children forcibly relocated to Russia remains a significant point of contention, with Ukraine demanding their return as a precondition for peace talks. Since the 2022 invasion, Russia has transferred thousands of children from occupied territories, placing them in orphanages or with Russian families and often granting them Russian citizenship. While Russia denies any abduction, claiming it "rescued" the children, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for President Putin for the war crime of unlawful deportation. International pressure is mounting to secure their return.</p>

The exercises come at a time of escalating regional tensions, following a recent Russian drone incursion into Poland.

          <p>While authorities have identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, his motive remains unclear, fueling intense political speculation. Utah's governor stated that investigators believe Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," though details supporting this conclusion have not been released. In the absence of a clear motive, reports have focused on Robinson's background as a student from a Republican family. The lack of clarity has allowed political figures to frame the tragedy to fit pre-existing narratives about political violence.</p>

          <p>The BBC understands that before appointing Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's office specifically questioned him about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The questions were reportedly sent after initial vetting flagged the relationship, but Mandelson's answers were deemed sufficient at the time. He was ultimately dismissed from the post after newly surfaced emails showed him sending supportive messages to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. The revelation has intensified scrutiny of the Prime Minister's judgment and the government's vetting processes.</p>
