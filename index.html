          <p>A 38-year-old man was fatally stabbed on a No. 5 subway train in Manhattan after a fight with another man. The incident occurred during rush hour as the train pulled into the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station. Police responded to a 911 call and found the victim unconscious with chest wounds; he was later pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital. The assailant, believed to be in his 30s, fled the station, and the investigation is ongoing, with authorities stating that the two men likely did not know each other.</p>

          <p>Haji Najibullah, a former Taliban commander, pleaded guilty in a US court to hostage-taking, including that of an American journalist, and to providing material support for acts of terrorism resulting in the deaths of US soldiers. The charges stem from incidents between 2007 and 2009, including attacks on a US military convoy and the kidnapping of the journalist in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Najibullah faces a life sentence after being arrested and extradited from Ukraine in 2020, serving as a reminder of the US's commitment to pursuing those who harm Americans.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon established a system in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols, according to sources. A computer monitor provided remote access to his personal cellphone, raising security concerns as it enabled access to personal texts and Signal chats in a sensitive facility where cellphones are prohibited. This follows criticism after Hegseth shared details about impending US airstrikes in Yemen within a private Signal group, raising questions about information security.</p>

Other e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu have also increased prices after the U.S. closed a loophole allowing duty-free entry for goods under $800.

          <p>Pornography has profoundly shaped American culture, influencing everything from social media to politics. The mainstreaming of regressive and dehumanizing behavior, the reinforcement of catering to men, and the sexualization of women are some of the impacts. While sexual openness is often framed as empowering, the term is frequently used to sell products that do not actually empower women.
