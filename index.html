          <p>Germany is working to improve its cybersecurity infrastructure in response to increasing cyberattacks targeting state agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure. The country is playing catch-up, particularly among small and medium-sized companies and state authorities, according to Christian DÃ¶rr from the Hasso Plattner Institute. These attacks, which include DDoS and ransomware incidents, are becoming more professional and sophisticated, with attackers increasingly utilizing AI. Germany is investing in advanced technologies such as sensor-equipped fiber cables to detect suspicious activities near critical infrastructure. The country emphasizes closer cooperation between state and businesses to enhance resilience and ensure the safety and functionality of society.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage, with many expressing a desire to live in a world without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups where smartphones are not allowed, promoting real-world interactions and digital detox retreats. Studies indicate that young people spend a significant amount of time on their phones but often feel worse after using social media. Some countries are considering measures like mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media use to combat the harmful effects of excessive smartphone usage. The Dutch Offline Club aims to normalize phone-free spaces and offline communities, offering a way for people to reconnect with themselves and others.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least eight deaths and over 30 injuries, according to regional officials. The attacks impacted the Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, and Mykolaiv regions, with four deaths reported in Khmelnytskyi. This follows a day after Kyiv experienced one of the heaviest assaults since the start of the Russian invasion. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have intercepted numerous Ukrainian drones over Russian regions during the same period, but did not report any casualties. The ongoing conflict, initiated in February 2022, has left Moscow in control of approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspaper front pages are dominated by stories concerning child benefit caps and winter fuel payments for the elderly, indicating a political battleground over social welfare policies. The Observer reports that the government plans to scrap the two-child benefit cap due to party pressure, while the Sunday Telegraph notes Nigel Farage's intention to counter Sir Keir Starmer by pledging to eliminate the cap and fully restore winter fuel payments. The Sunday Mirror leads with a report on a possible Kremlin link in the arson attacks connected to Sir Keir Starmer, with MI5 investigating whether Russian spies are involved.

          <p>South Western Railways has become the first private rail operator in the UK to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire network by the end of 2027.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed it as a watershed moment, ending 30 years of fragmentation. The Labour government anticipates savings of up to Â£150 million in compensation fees paid to rail operators. Southeastern and Eastern services are slated for nationalization by the end of 2025.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Dog Owner's Work Stress to Anxiety in Their Pets</h2>

          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety to their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that stress can spill over from humans to their pets, likely due to emotional contagion and changes in care routines. The study highlights the importance of avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect the well-being of dogs.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what they claim is the world's fastest electromagnetic coilgun. The coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute, surpassing traditional firearms and US commercial models. The breakthrough centers on eliminating capacitors, which are devices that store electrical energy, and powering the gun directly with lithium batteries. This advancement overcomes previous limitations on firing rate and recharge times, as detailed in a peer-reviewed paper published in Chinaâ€™s Journal of Gun Launch & Control.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto delivered a decisive two-run double against the Dodgers, capitalizing on Tony Gonsolin's loss of command in a game where the Dodgers' pitching staff was already stretched thin.

With an overworked bullpen, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts had limited options and was forced to leave Gonsolin in the game. The Mets ultimately secured a 5-2 victory, highlighting the Dodgers' reliance on their starters amid a grueling schedule.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist known for her influential book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual assault," has died at the age of 90. Brownmiller's book redefined societal understanding of sexual assault, framing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. Her work contributed to significant legal and social changes, including the establishment of rape-crisis centers and the revision of laws to ease prosecution of perpetrators. While her views sparked controversy, particularly regarding pornography and personal responsibility, her impact on the feminist movement remains significant.</p>
