          <p>A tourist boat carrying 53 people capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's popular Ha Long Bay, resulting in the deaths of at least 34 individuals, including eight children. The vessel, named Wonder Seas, was primarily carrying Vietnamese families from Hanoi when it was struck by torrential rain and hailstones. Rescue efforts have been hampered by the severe weather, though eleven people have been pulled from the water alive. Vietnam's prime minister has sent condolences and ordered a full investigation into the cause of the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an ultra-light foam material known as "marshmallow concrete" designed to enhance airport safety by preventing runway overruns. The material is engineered to crumble upon impact, safely absorbing an aircraft's energy and bringing it to a stop during an emergency. Unlike traditional safety systems, this affordable alternative uses ordinary cement and has proven durable and reliable in various climates across 14 Chinese airports. This innovation is poised to become a new global standard for improving aviation safety.</p>

          <p>A driver intentionally plowed a vehicle into a crowd of people waiting outside the Vermont Hollywood nightclub in Los Angeles, injuring 30 individuals, seven of them critically. Police are investigating the incident as an assault with a deadly weapon, stating the driver made a U-turn before accelerating into the crowd. In the chaotic aftermath, bystanders pulled the driver from the car and attacked him; he was also shot by another suspect who then fled the scene. The driver was hospitalized for surgery.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commented on the potential release of grand jury files related to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that even if approved by the courts, it would not be enough to satisfy "the troublemakers and radical left lunatics." His remarks on Truth Social followed a move by the Department of Justice, at Trump's own request, to ask judges to unseal the testimony. This development comes amid sustained pressure on the president to provide transparency regarding the notorious sex offender's case.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" in an April filing with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This designation is typically for firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and can offer preferential access to federal contracts. The filing occurred shortly before a funding round valued Neuralink at $9 billion, and a company spokesperson has since stated the designation was an error that has been corrected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists offer a mixed assessment of President Trump's tariff policies, noting that they have generated substantial tax revenue and prompted some companies to announce new investments in the U.S. However, analysts also caution that these corporate pledges are long-term and reversible, while the tariffs have started to increase prices on some consumer goods. The primary risk remains that the levies could fuel broader inflation, potentially disrupting the economy and offsetting any gains from reshoring or revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. has issued a recall for more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco" brand ready-to-eat chicken sausage products.

The products were produced on June 28, 2025, and distributed to retail locations nationwide. The Food Safety and Inspection Service advises consumers to throw away the items or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the severe legal and economic ramifications that could occur if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Experts say such an unprecedented move would almost certainly trigger a prolonged court battle over the legal standard of "cause" for removal, creating immense uncertainty. The action could destabilize financial markets, undermine the central bank's independence, and paradoxically lead to higher long-term interest rates as the Fed's credibility is called into question.

          <p>Bestselling author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway contends that the advice to "follow your passion" is flawed and typically comes from those who are already wealthy. Instead, he advocates for a more pragmatic approach to career development. Galloway's advice is to identify your talents, find where they intersect with financially viable opportunities, and develop a resilience to rejection. He believes this strategy of combining skill with market demand is a more reliable path to success than pursuing passion alone.</p>

          <p>This essay argues that the recent resurgence in the popularity of tanning is more than a cosmetic trend; it is intertwined with a broader anti-establishment and alternative-health ideology. The article connects the embrace of sun exposure to a deep-seated skepticism of mainstream public health institutions and scientific guidance on issues like sunscreen and skin cancer. This perspective suggests that for a growing number of people, tanning has become a symbol of defiance and a return to a perceived natural state.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) and will reduce agency staff by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. The administration states the move will save money and better focus scientific efforts, but critics and union leaders warn it will cripple the EPA's ability to protect public health. The ORD has long served as the agency's core scientific arm, providing the foundational research for environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>The UK continues to face a threat of flash floods, with yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms active across all four nations. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and southeast England passed without the intense rainfall that was feared. However, the Met Office has extended alerts into Monday, as the ground, parched by a recent heatwave, has a reduced capacity to absorb water, making further travel disruption and localized flooding possible.</p>
