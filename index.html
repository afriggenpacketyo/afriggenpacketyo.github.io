          <p>Over 130 million Americans from Texas to Maine are under alerts for a dangerous heatwave, with heat indices expected to reach as high as 115 degrees in the Mississippi River Valley. Major cities like Chicago, New York, and Boston are bracing for feels-like temperatures well over 100 degrees, offering little relief even at night. The extreme heat is projected to persist into the next week, particularly in the Southeast, which faces a level four "extreme heat risk." Concurrently, the Midwest is on alert for potential flash flooding from strong thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, are cautioning that a simple 'kill switch' will not be a viable solution to control a potential superintelligent AI. They argue that once AI surpasses human intelligence, its power of persuasion could be its most formidable tool, making it capable of manipulating humans to ensure its own survival. The discussion highlights that AI's decentralized nature across global data centers makes a physical shutdown nearly impossible without causing a catastrophic collapse of civilization's critical infrastructure. The focus, experts suggest, should be on instilling benevolent values in AI systems rather than on creating failsafes that AI could learn to circumvent.</p>

          <p>Tanya Simon, a 25-year veteran of "60 Minutes" and daughter of late correspondent Bob Simon, has been appointed as the newsmagazine's new executive producer. She is the first woman and only the fourth person to lead the show in its 57-year history. Her appointment has been met with relief by the program's staff, who had urged parent company Paramount to choose an internal candidate. Simon takes the helm during a challenging period, following a controversial $16 million settlement paid to President Trump, which has raised concerns about the program's future editorial independence.</p>

          <p>Columbia University reached a deal with the Trump administration to restore $400 million in federal funding, but the agreement has sparked both praise and condemnation. In exchange for the funds, Columbia will pay $220 million in settlements and implement measures critics call an assault on academic freedom, such as a partial mask ban and new oversight of admissions. Some faculty labeled the deal a form of "extortion," while pro-Israel groups praised it for addressing antisemitism. The agreement is seen as a significant moment in the relationship between higher education and an administration critical of universities.</p>

          <p>UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has stated that the government shares the public's "huge frustration" regarding the strain the asylum system places on housing. He acknowledged the issue of the Home Office competing with local councils for a limited supply of temporary accommodation for both asylum seekers and homeless families. Reynolds said the solution involves building more homes, accelerating the processing of asylum claims, and reducing small boat crossings. The comments come as local councils report being at a "breaking point" due to rising costs and demand for temporary housing.</p>

          <p>Utility company Southern California Edison (SCE) has announced it will establish a compensation fund for victims of the deadly Eaton wildfire from January, even before investigators have officially determined the fire's cause. The voluntary program was developed with the administrators of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to offer an expedited process for resolving claims without lengthy litigation. While the cause is still under investigation, a leading theory suggests that SCE's aging equipment may have sparked the blaze. The move comes as dozens of lawsuits have been filed against the utility by affected families and the city of Los Angeles.</p>

The ultimatum comes as the deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations approaches on September 17. The proposed deal would require American ownership of the technology and control over the algorithm to address national security concerns.</p>

The initial legislation sparked Ukraine's largest protests since the 2022 invasion, with critics fearing it would undermine the fight against corruption, a key requirement for the country's potential EU membership.</p>
