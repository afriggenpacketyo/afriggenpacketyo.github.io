          <h2>Trump Strikes Trade Deal with Britain Amid Global Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:22:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports. The deal includes arrangements such as allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with a 10 percent tariff, offering a partial exemption from new auto levies. This agreement is part of a broader effort to address global economic tensions arising from Trump's tariff policies, as Japan and the EU reaffirm their collaboration in maintaining global free trade amid these challenges. The deal could hint at future trade strategies for other countries amidst ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:15:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to consider a tax increase on high-income earners, specifically those making over $2.5 million annually, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This proposal marks a potential reversal of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the top income tax rate. Trump's motivation appears to be to offset the costs of other tax cuts and protect Medicaid, a healthcare program for the poor, from significant spending reductions. Republicans are also considering other populist tax measures, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>Multiple newspapers are covering the new trade agreement between the US and the UK, with the Daily Mail highlighting its potential to save the British car industry. The Financial Times notes the UK secured concessions on car and steel exports but failed to reverse a flat ten percent levy on most goods. The Daily Telegraph reports the US can object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim the government dismisses. Several papers also report on the election of Cardinal Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born leader of the Roman Catholic Church, with the Guardian focusing on his past criticisms of Trump's refugee policies.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes after the U.S. announced tariffs on Indian exports, which are currently suspended. Experts suggest that a trade deal with the U.S. could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its access to global markets. While some concerns exist about the impact on domestic manufacturing, others believe that certain sectors, like pharmaceuticals, may not be significantly affected.</p>

          <p>Zara, owned by Inditex, is marking 50 years since its first store opening, offering a rare glimpse into its operations. CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras states that Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market. With 350 designers from 40 countries, Zara's inspiration comes from anywhere ranging from the "street" to the cinema as well as the catwalks. It has a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is planning “previously unthinkable” cuts to try to balance the books, health bosses say. Services including diabetes care for young people, rehab centres and talking therapies are in the firing line, according to NHS Providers, which represents health managers. Staff, including doctors and nurses, also face the axe - and some NHS trusts are stopping overtime for doctors, putting the drive to cut the hospital waiting lists at risk. NHS Providers said some of the savings were "eye-watering", but the Department of Health and Social Care said NHS services should focus on cutting bureaucracy and driving up productivity.</p>
