        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Open Network reveals that a cancer diagnosis leads to a substantial increase in monthly out-of-pocket expenses for privately insured patients. Researchers found that costs jumped by an average of over $590 per month following a diagnosis, with expenses rising further as the disease progresses to later stages. The analysis, which examined medical claims for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer patients under 65, highlights the significant financial toxicity of cancer. The report's authors suggest these findings underscore the need for policy reforms like paid sick leave to alleviate the financial burden on individuals and their families.</p>

The company, a key supplier for AI data centers, saw strong organic sales growth and robust orders in its data center segment, which grew about 55% year over year. Despite the solid performance, the company's stock fell as the results did not meet Wall Street's exceptionally high expectations and management cited some future macro uncertainties.

CEO Alex Karp celebrated the results, calling it a "truly anomalous quarter" and expressing pride in the company's performance. Palantir also raised its full-year revenue guidance, though some analysts remain cautious about the stock's high valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony related to her case. In a court filing, her lawyers argued that releasing the material would violate grand jury secrecy and infringe upon the due process rights of Maxwell, who is alive and pursuing an appeal to the Supreme Court. They contend that unlike the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell remains a target and that the unsealing of untested, hearsay-laden testimony would create a media firestorm. The filing also noted that Maxwell has not been permitted to review the documents herself.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the U.S., had rejected him as a customer. In a CNBC interview, Trump stated that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move his money and that Bank of America later declined his attempt to open an account. The allegations revive the ongoing debate about whether financial institutions are unfairly "de-banking" conservative clients. In response, JPMorgan stated it does not close accounts for political reasons and agreed that regulatory change is needed to address the issue.</p>

Despite Trump pardoning members convicted for the January 6 insurrection, the group's public demonstrations have decreased significantly. The analysis suggests two main reasons for this decline: internal fractures, including dissent against former leader Enrique Tarrio, and the fact that the Trump administration's aggressive policies, particularly on immigration, are already enacting the group's agenda. With agencies like ICE carrying out mass deportations, the group has less to rally against, effectively being co-opted by the state.</p>

While widespread job displacement has not yet occurred, there has been a notable pullback in tech hiring that has disproportionately affected younger employees. The unemployment rate for tech workers aged 20 to 30 has jumped by three percentage points since the start of the year.

          <p>A new annual report from the FBI shows that crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, indicates a 4.5% drop in violent crime, including a significant 14.9% decrease in murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. Property crime also fell by 8.1%, with a notable 18.6% decline in motor vehicle thefts. While experts note that some categories like aggravated assault remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, the overall trend continues a decline from the spike seen immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to release $140 million in delayed funding for its Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program, which supports state and local efforts to combat the fentanyl crisis. The news comes as a relief to public health departments that rely on the federal funds. However, the situation remains complex, as the Office of Management and Budget has now frozen the budgets for several dozen other CDC programs. These newly frozen funds primarily affect initiatives related to chronic disease, nutrition, school health, and violence prevention, creating continued uncertainty for the agency.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Pro-Israel Right Is Redefining Anti-Semitism to Include Criticism of Israel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that a segment of the American pro-Israel right is shifting the definition of anti-Semitism. The author contends that this group increasingly conflates criticism of Israeli government policy with Jew-hatred, citing examples like labeling Senator Bernie Sanders's statements as a "blood libel." The piece suggests this rhetorical strategy provides cover for traditional right-wing anti-Semites who support Israel for geopolitical reasons, while simultaneously weakening the fight against genuine anti-Semitism by diluting the term's meaning. The author warns this approach mirrors illiberal tactics and could generate a backlash.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering a plan for the full military occupation of the Gaza Strip, despite opposition from military leadership. Netanyahu met with the army chief to discuss options for the next phase of the war, which is now in its 22nd month. While no official details were released, Israeli media suggests the prime minister favors a complete seizure of the enclave, a move that would require approval from the Security Cabinet. Critics, including former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, warn that such an action would lead to an endless war with immense casualties.</p>

While selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food.

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the fatal Titan submersible implosion has concluded the tragedy was preventable and resulted from OceanGate's flawed safety culture and evasion of regulatory oversight. The 300-page report states the company used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory confusion to operate outside established deep-sea protocols. Investigators found the vessel's design was inadequate and that its hull integrity was likely compromised in previous incidents. The report largely blames co-founder Stockton Rush, who died in the implosion, for ignoring warnings and creating an environment where safety concerns were dismissed in favor of operational continuity.</p>

          <p>This cultural analysis examines the controversy surrounding a Sydney Sweeney jeans advertisement and connects it to the historical legacy of the "blonde bombshell" archetype in America. The article argues that Sweeney's public image, which evokes classic figures like Marilyn Monroe, carries potent symbolism related to race, gender, and sexuality. This symbolism, which blends hypersexuality with a perceived innocence and whiteness, makes her a focal point for political scrutiny. The piece suggests that the intense reactions to the ad reveal how charged this archetype remains, embodying both nostalgic ideals and threatening undertones for different audiences.</p>
