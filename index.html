          <h2>UK School Caterers Reduce Meal Portions and Meat Content Due to Rising Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:08:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School food caterers in the UK are being forced to reduce portion sizes, use less meat, and switch to cheaper ingredients to cope with rising food costs. The head of LACA, a school food organization, stated that government funding for free school meals is insufficient to cover the actual cost of providing nutritious lunches, which is estimated to be around £3.45 per meal compared to the £2.61 provided. This funding gap puts increasing pressure on schools, some of which are using their own budgets to subsidize meals, and raises concerns about the nutritional value of food served to children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," offers a modern take on the London romantic comedy, inspired by her own experiences moving to the city. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, contrasts the fantasized, historical image of England with the contemporary reality of city life. Dunham explains that the series explores the social and linguistic challenges of an American workaholic relocating to London. The show also features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Andrew Scott, Stephen Fry, and Jennifer Saunders, who Dunham credits as a major comedic influence.</p>

          <h2>China's Producer Prices See Largest Decline in Nearly Two Years, Deepening Deflation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 00:07:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June year-over-year, marking the most significant drop in almost two years and extending a deflationary trend that began in late 2022. This decline, worse than economists' expectations, reflects a deepening price war among manufacturers grappling with excess inventory and weak consumer demand. While the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight 0.1% increase, returning to growth, economists warn it is too early to declare an end to deflationary pressures. The government has pledged to regulate aggressive price-cutting, which has been hurting corporate profitability without significantly boosting consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intelligence officials across Europe are raising alarms about an escalating and increasingly violent sabotage campaign directed by Russia's intelligence services. An arson attack on a London warehouse storing supplies for Ukraine, for which five men were convicted, is cited as a prime example of this new phase. Officials state that Russia is now recruiting young, amateur proxies to conduct attacks like arson and bombings, a shift from using professional spies. This change in tactics has led to more dangerous and unpredictable incidents, with over 70 such events documented since 2022, raising fears of potential casualties as untrained individuals carry out these disruptive acts.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed an 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) green belt in Inner Mongolia, effectively enclosing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. This significant environmental project aims to combat desertification and control the movement of sand in the Alxa league region. The method involves using straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. This long-term strategy is part of China's broader "green great wall" initiative, designed to build a robust ecological barrier and mitigate the effects of desert expansion on the country.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump has approved the provision of defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move he had previously resisted despite requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. During a cabinet meeting, Trump expressed his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a potential strain in their relationship and prompting questions about the reasons for this sudden change in stance. The decision comes as the administration also navigates other foreign policy matters, including hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for discussions on a potential Gaza ceasefire. This development marks a notable U-turn in the U.S. approach to the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

The ruling permits the firing of potentially hundreds of thousands of government employees while legal challenges to the policy continue in lower courts. The decision was unsigned, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued a public dissent, warning of "mass employee terminations" and the "dismantling of much of the Federal Government." This action is part of a series of administration efforts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which have already resulted in approximately 260,000 departures from federal service.</p>

Ghannouchi, the 84-year-old leader of the Ennahda party, received a 14-year term on charges including inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government, which his defense team claims are based on false testimony. This is the latest in a series of legal actions against opposition figures since President Kais Saied dissolved parliament in 2021.

Experts noted that while the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch hours in advance, the rapid rise of the water, combined with overnight timing and increased population density, made warnings difficult to receive and act upon.

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, was released from ICE detention following advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Kashanian was detained last month at her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. After a surge of community support, Scalise requested that the Department of Homeland Security review her case, leading to her release. Her attorney noted that while her long-term legal status is still uncertain, the intervention from a high-ranking politician was crucial in securing her freedom.</p>

The commerce ministry stated the move was to safeguard national security and fulfill international non-proliferation obligations. Among the targeted companies is AIDC, a crucial supplier to Taiwan's indigenous defense programs, including its fighter jet development.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that fraudulently places North Korean IT workers in jobs at global companies. The scheme involves stealing the identities of U.S. citizens to create aliases for the workers, who then earn salaries that are funneled back to fund North Korea's weapons programs. According to U.S. officials, thousands of these highly skilled workers, primarily based in China and Russia, generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the Kim regime. The sanctions are part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt North Korea's illicit funding channels.</p>

Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in these resilient structures, which may cost more upfront but can lead to long-term savings, including on insurance.

The ICC judges stated that the Taliban has systematically deprived women and girls of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on imported copper, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the metal's imports. The move, which is expected to take effect by the end of the month, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, construction, and electric vehicles, and the U.S. imports about half of its supply, primarily from Chile and Canada. This action is part of the administration's broader protectionist strategy, which includes similar high tariffs on steel and aluminum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Local officials in Kerr County, Texas, are facing scrutiny over their response to the deadly flash floods, declining to answer specific questions about their preparedness and timeline of action. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 1:14 a.m. on the day of the disaster, but the county sheriff stated he was not notified until "around the 4 to 5 a.m. area." When pressed for details about when the county's emergency manager was alerted and whether they activated warning systems, officials said that determining a timeline was not their current priority, which is focused on search and recovery.</p>
