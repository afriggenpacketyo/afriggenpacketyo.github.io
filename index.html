          <p>In a recent interview, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Todd Lyons detailed the agency's strategy under the Trump administration, emphasizing a focus on public safety and achieving a goal of one million annual deportations. Lyons explained that increased funding will go toward hiring 10,000 more officers and expanding detention capacity, which he states is for efficient processing, not punitive detention. He defended agents wearing masks due to a rise in threats and doxxing, and confirmed that while prioritizing dangerous criminals, agents will also arrest any undocumented individuals they encounter, known as collateral arrests.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled Texas legislature is advancing a controversial plan to redraw the state's congressional districts mid-decade, a move aimed at securing five additional GOP seats in the 2026 elections. This power grab is being pushed during a special session ostensibly called to address recent deadly flooding, drawing sharp criticism from Democrats who label it a form of "election theft." Opponents argue the strategy exploits the absence of federal pre-clearance requirements and hijacks a session that should be focused on disaster relief for affected communities.</p>

Researchers from CICC suggest that the solution lies in boosting domestic demand to expand the overall market size, creating an "incremental cake" rather than fighting over a fixed one. They argue that fostering innovation and offering differentiated products can break the self-defeating cycle and lead to more sustainable, demand-driven growth for Chinese enterprises.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union has appointed Steve Tandy, formerly Scotland's defence coach, as the new head coach of the men's national team. Tandy, a proud Welshman, will take charge on September 1 with a contract extending through at least the 2027 World Cup in Australia. He faces the significant task of rebuilding the team, which has struggled recently, slipping to a record-low world ranking and enduring a long losing streak before a recent victory in Japan.</p>

          <p>A group of armed men stormed a bar in the coastal city of General Villamil Playas, Ecuador, and opened fire, killing at least nine people who were playing pool. The massacre is the latest incident in a historic wave of violence sweeping the nation as powerful drug trafficking organizations expand their influence. The country's homicide rate has skyrocketed in recent years, and authorities are struggling to contain the bloodshed despite classifying major gangs as terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>Ryanair is considering raising the bonus it pays to gate staff for identifying and charging passengers with oversized carry-on luggage. The budget airline currently offers about €1.50 per intercepted bag to incentivize employees to enforce its strict baggage rules, which CEO Michael O'Leary calls essential to prevent boarding delays on full flights. The company argues that over 99% of passengers comply, but it remains aggressive in eliminating what it terms the "scourge" of excess baggage.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has publicly acknowledged that its relationship with Azerbaijan is currently in a "difficult period," though it expressed hope for recovery. The statement follows Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's demand that Russia admit fault for the accidental downing of an Azerbaijani passenger plane in December 2024, which killed 38 people. Tensions have also been heightened by the recent deaths of two ethnic Azerbaijani men while in Russian police custody, further straining diplomatic ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Global auto manufacturer Stellantis has stated that US tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have cost the company €300 million.

The parent company of brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Chrysler reported that its shipments to North America fell by 25% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, illustrating the direct economic consequences of the protectionist trade policy.
