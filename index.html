          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have significantly decreased, particularly among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in risk, according to data from the CDC. While over 31,000 people under 35 died from drug overdoses in 2021, that number fell to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider Narcan distribution, less potent fentanyl, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use, including cannabis and psychedelics, among young people. Despite this progress, challenges remain, especially for individuals struggling with severe addiction.</p>
