        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the trade war between the U.S. and China escalates, U.S. retailers are warning of potential product shortages due to tariffs. Shipments from China to the U.S. have dropped sharply, with some estimates indicating a decline of up to 60% in container bookings. Retailers had previously stockpiled inventory, but experts predict that consumers may face out-of-stock situations by summer. The tariffs, which now stand as high as 145% on Chinese products, are making goods significantly more expensive, leading some businesses to consider abandoning imports altogether.

          <p>An NFL executive suggests Shedeur Sanders' slide in the NFL Draft might be attributed to his approach to team visits and his decision not to hire an agent. The executive believes Sanders treated visits like recruiting trips rather than job interviews, and that the absence of an experienced agent hindered his understanding of the draft process. This report follows an anonymous NFL assistant coach's negative assessment of Sanders' pre-draft interview, citing entitlement and poor on-field behavior. Sanders was eventually drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round.</p>

          <p>President Trump marked his 100th day in office with a campaign-style speech in Michigan, highlighting his administration's accomplishments and attacking political rivals. He touted a dramatic decrease in illegal border crossings and progress on immigration, while also criticizing the Federal Reserve and dismissing unfavorable opinion polls. The president also softened his stance on auto tariffs after warnings from U.S. carmakers, but insisted that car firms were lining up to open new manufacturing plants in the Midwestern state. Despite claims of progress, inflation, energy prices and mortgage rates have fallen since Trump took office, although unemployment has risen slightly, consumer sentiment has sagged and the stock market was plunged into turmoil by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Point Roberts, a small town in Washington state accessible only through Canada, is facing severe economic hardship due to trade tensions. The town relies heavily on Canadian customers, who account for 90% of its business, but recent rhetoric and tariffs have led to a significant decline in visitors. Businesses are struggling, with some, like a shipping delivery service, being forced to close permanently due to a 75% drop in business. Residents fear that even if tariffs are reversed, restoring trust with Canadian visitors will be a challenge.</p>

          <p>The UK government is not adequately preparing for the growing threats posed by climate change, according to a critical report by the Climate Change Committee (CCC). The report finds that progress in adapting to rising temperatures is too slow or stalled, leaving the UK vulnerable to economic and health impacts. The CCC highlights the lack of progress in areas such as health, where hospitals are vulnerable to extreme heat, and flooding, where plans to ensure resilience have worsened. The committee urges the government to take the issue seriously and increase investment in adaptation measures.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders easing some auto tariffs, responding to concerns from carmakers about the impact on production costs and profits. The changes modify tariffs to prevent the stacking of levies and offer temporary tariff relief for imported components. While automakers welcomed the move, they also noted that the changes leave in place a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, which will still raise prices for consumers. The decision reflects the administration's efforts to balance trade policy with the needs of the domestic auto industry.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Adjusts Automotive Tariffs, Offers Relief to Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 20:09:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is softening some automotive tariffs to alleviate the burden on the car industry. While a 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains, new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level by preventing multiple levies from stacking. Automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S. will qualify for partial reimbursements on parts-related tariffs for two years. President Trump stated that the administration will "slaughter them if they don't" bring parts production back to the U.S., without providing further details.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease some tariffs on automakers to ensure the companies aren't hit twice by its tariffs. The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but automakers won't be subject to the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum. Reimbursements will also be given to automakers who have already paid the double tariffs, the administration said. Automakers are reacting positively to the change.</p>
