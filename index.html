          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 16:07:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate drops to its lowest level in nearly a year, financial experts outline several strategies for homebuyers to secure even better terms. Key recommendations include improving one's credit score, as higher FICO scores directly correlate with lower interest rates, potentially saving thousands over the life of a loan. Additionally, making a larger down payment of 20% or more can reduce lender risk and unlock more favorable rates. Exploring alternatives to a traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), can also provide a lower initial rate for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Democrats have released a screenshot of a controversial 2003 birthday note allegedly signed by Donald Trump for Jeffrey Epstein. The note, part of a "birthday book" obtained from Epstein's estate, includes a hand-drawn sketch of a woman's torso and a message that Trump has vehemently denied writing, leading him to sue The Wall Street Journal for defamation after they first reported on it. The White House maintains the signature is not authentic, though comparisons to Trump's evolving signature over the years suggest similarities to his style from that era. The release is part of a bipartisan House Oversight Committee investigation into records related to the deceased financier.</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge, climbing more than 15% after S&P Global announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 index. This inclusion, which replaces Caesars Entertainment, is a major milestone for the company and often acts as a catalyst for stock growth, as passive funds tracking the index are required to purchase its shares. The move ends months of speculation on Wall Street and marks a high point for the stock, which has seen a more than 210% increase year-to-date. This development validates the company's performance and market position since its public offering in 2021. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy appeared on the historic Royal Courts of Justice building in London, only for authorities to announce its imminent removal. The artwork depicts a judge using a gavel to strike a protester who is holding a blank sign with red paint splatters, which is being interpreted by some activists as a commentary on recent government actions against protest groups. Banksy authenticated the piece via his Instagram account, his typical method of claiming new works. Due to the building's protected historical status, officials stated the mural must be carefully removed to preserve its original character.</p>

          <h2>An Analysis of Whether Seniors Can Opt Out of Paying for Medicare Part B</h2>

          <p>This article explores the financial considerations for seniors regarding Medicare Part B, which, unlike the generally free Part A, requires a monthly premium. While most seniors cannot completely avoid this cost, certain exceptions exist, such as delaying enrollment without penalty while still employed and covered by a creditable employer health plan. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or dual eligibility with Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the premium. However, the article cautions that forgoing Part B enrollment can restrict access to crucial supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs later.</p>

          <p>Retired tennis superstar Serena Williams, through her firm Serena Ventures, has invested in Unrivaled, a women's 3-on-3 basketball league, during its latest funding round. This investment contributes to the league's new valuation of $340 million and aligns Williams with other prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and Billie Jean King who are also backing the venture. Unrivaled was established to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason, aiming to offer the highest average salary in professional women's sports league history.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has initiated a new, intensified immigration enforcement action in Chicago, named "Operation Midway Blitz." The department stated the operation will target "criminal illegal aliens," linking the action to Illinois's sanctuary policies. This move has drawn sharp criticism from state and local leaders, including Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, who condemned it as a politically motivated effort to stoke fear without coordinating with local law enforcement on public safety. The operation follows a social media post from President Trump alluding to increased deportations, escalating the conflict between federal immigration authorities and Democratic-led sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, savers with a significant sum like $40,000 face a strategic choice between a Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account. A key consideration is the long-term interest-earning potential; CDs offer a fixed rate that locks in current high returns, protecting against future rate drops, whereas savings account rates are variable. However, this comes at the cost of liquidity, as accessing CD funds before maturity incurs penalties, making a high-yield savings account better for those who might need the money unexpectedly. The article advises savers to weigh the benefits of a CD's guaranteed return against the flexibility of a savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

Led by Susan B.

They contend that the ACA's mechanism for separating these funds is ineffective, leading to commingling of public and private money. Pro-choice advocates counter that this push is an attempt to further restrict abortion access, even in states where it remains legal.</p>

The policy change, which starts by dropping requirements for hepatitis B and chickenpox vaccines, has been criticized by public health experts who warn that school mandates are a proven tool for preventing disease outbreaks.

This MLS ban is notably less severe than the separate six-game suspension issued by the Leagues Cup's own disciplinary committee.

The analysis explains that while there is evidence of constitutional violations in some raids, Supreme Court precedent makes it very difficult to secure broad, forward-looking injunctions against law enforcement tactics, favoring individual lawsuits instead. The Supreme Court's Republican majority was therefore likely to be solicitous of the administration's request.</p>

          <p>France has been thrown into political turmoil after Prime Minister François Bayrou's government was defeated in a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The vote, which failed by a margin of 364 to 194, forces Bayrou to resign and leaves President Emmanuel Macron to appoint the country's fifth prime minister in under two years. The crisis was triggered by Bayrou's attempt to pass an unpopular 2026 budget aimed at tackling France's massive national debt through austerity measures like freezing welfare payments. Lacking a majority, his government fell when opposition parties from both the left and the hard-right united against the proposed budget.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has increased its settlement offer in its bankruptcy case to a minimum of $230 million for over 600 survivors of clergy sexual assault. This new, higher figure is an attempt to secure the necessary two-thirds approval from claimants after a previous $180 million offer was met with opposition from a significant number of victims and their attorneys. The settlement funds will come from the archdiocese and its smaller insurers, but survivors may still pursue additional claims against the primary insurer, Travelers, which has not yet joined the agreement. The case has been contentious, highlighting the financial and moral reckoning of the church's historical abuse crisis.</p>

          <p>Following Citigroup's decision to transfer $80 billion in client assets to BlackRock, analysts are projecting a positive, albeit incremental, impact on BlackRock's earnings. A report from Cowen estimates that this asset influx could add at least 25 cents to the firm's adjusted earnings per share once fully integrated, providing further validation for BlackRock's leading position in the asset management industry. Separately, the article notes that Meta Platforms has officially been awarded a U.S. Army contract to develop combat goggles using its AR/VR technology. While not a major revenue driver yet, this represents a potentially significant new application for the technology developed for the metaverse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Confidence among U.S. workers in their ability to find a new job has plummeted to an all-time low, according to the New York Federal Reserve's latest Survey of Consumer Expectations. The probability of finding new employment after a job loss dropped sharply to 44.9%, the lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This data signals a significant reversal of the "Great Resignation" trend, as a slowing labor market and cautious hiring by employers are causing workers to stay in their current positions. The sentiment aligns with a recent dismal jobs report, which showed minimal payroll growth and a rising unemployment rate, indicating growing uncertainty in the U.S. economy.

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run, a major half marathon in the UK, have issued a public apology after the finisher medals given to 60,000 participants featured a geographical error. The medals were intended to show an aerial view of the race's location, Newcastle and the River Tyne, but instead depicted the nearby rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. In a humorous response, the Great Run Company admitted the mistake, which also appeared on official merchandise, calling it "the most unique T-shirt and medal in Great North Run history." Despite the blunder, race founder Sir Brendan Foster said runners should still wear their medals with pride after a fantastic event.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted an emergency request from the Trump administration, lifting a lower court's order that had restricted sweeping immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area. The district court's injunction had barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without additional reasonable suspicion. In a 6-3 decision, the court's conservative majority froze that order, allowing the broader enforcement tactics to resume while the case proceeds. The dissenting liberal justices sharply criticized the move, with Justice Sotomayor writing that it allows the government to "seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job."</p>

Now in its 27th year, the program trains nursing students to offer emotional, informational, and physical support to mothers during labor and childbirth. The student doulas act as advocates for the patient, bridging the gap with medical staff to help ensure a more supportive birth experience. The initiative has become more accessible following a new Maryland law that requires all hospitals to have policies allowing certified doulas to be present during childbirth, enhancing maternal care options across the state.</p>
