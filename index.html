          <p>Neera Tanden, former White House Domestic Policy Council Director, appeared before the House Oversight Committee for a closed-door meeting regarding President Joe Biden's mental acuity and the use of an autopen for executive actions. Committee Chairman James Comer stated the investigation aims to determine who was "calling the shots" during Biden's administration. Tanden's testimony marks the first of several interviews planned with former Biden senior aides, including Dr. Kevin Oâ€™Connor, Biden's former White House physician, who will appear under subpoena in July. The interviews are intended to shed light on the decision-making processes within the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Thousands of travelers have been infected with Hepatitis A across four European countries: Austria, Czechia, Hungary, and Slovakia, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Slovakia has reported the most cases, followed by Czechia, which has also reported six deaths. Hepatitis A is an acute viral liver disease spread through contaminated food or water, or close contact with infected individuals, and those who haven't been vaccinated or previously infected are susceptible. The ECDC recommends investigating transmission means, implementing targeted vaccination programs, and increasing awareness among high-risk groups, such as those who are homeless or use recreational drugs, to address the outbreak.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has urged Senate Republicans to finalize the megabill, which includes making the Trump 2017 tax cuts permanent, allocating additional funding for border security and the Department of Defense, scaling back Medicaid and SNAP benefits, limiting taxes on tips and overtime, and changing state and local tax caps, before taking any vacations. Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned House Republicans that their Independence Day celebrations might be affected as the House awaits the Senate's changes to the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act. Republicans are using budget reconciliation to sidestep Senate rules and pass the bill with a simple majority, although a KFF poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of the public views the bill unfavorably. The bill faces challenges related to state and local taxes, SNAP provisions, and rural hospital funding.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both Israel and Iran, accusing them of violating a ceasefire agreement he had announced the previous night. Speaking to ABC News, Trump stated that both nations "don't know what the f--- they're doing," and criticized Israel for dropping a "boat load of bombs" shortly after the deal was made. Trump also mentioned speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, emphasizing the need to sustain the ceasefire. Neither Iran nor Israel have publicly commented on Trump's remarks, but Trump's comments highlight the fragility of the ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in the Netherlands, shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, though he later stated both countries violated it. During the summit, Trump aimed to secure commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump on his actions in Iran and on securing new defense spending levels. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a key concern for NATO members, with discussions ongoing about whether to designate Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique.</p>

          <p>A civil court in Nantes ruled that the French government bears 60% responsibility for the 2016 death of Jean-Rene Auffray, a jogger who died after inhaling toxic hydrogen sulfide from rotting green algae on a beach in Brittany. The court cited the state's negligence in implementing regulations to protect waters from agricultural pollution, the main cause of algae bloom. Brittany, a major agricultural region in France, has struggled with excessive use of nitrate fertilizers and runoff from pig farms, leading to massive algae blooms. The court also noted that Auffray had put himself at risk by jogging in the area, and his family will receive compensation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been managing the conflict between Iran and Israel through a running social-media commentary, which has been described as bellicose, conciliatory, and unfiltered. Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel on social media, but then demanded Israel not drop bombs after an alleged Iranian violation of the truce. Experts predict challenges to any lasting ceasefire, citing the president's impulsiveness as a potential risk.

          <p>Ben Duckett's remarkable innings of 149 guided England to a target of 371, securing a victory against India on the final day of the first Test at Headingley.

Despite a brief setback with the dismissal of Duckett and Harry Brook, England maintained composure, with Joe Root and Jamie Smith leading the team to victory. England completed the win with 14 overs remaining, setting the stage for the second Test at Edgbaston.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that President Trump's tariffs create a "highly uncertain" path for the U.S. economy, warranting a cautious approach to cutting interest rates. Powell noted that the Fed expects tariff inflation to increase, but the extent to which it will affect consumers remains unknown. The Fed left interest rates unchanged but signaled potential rate cuts later in the year, despite pressure from President Trump for faster cuts. Powell emphasized that the Fed is monitoring the effects of Trump's policies on taxes, immigration, and regulation, citing potential boosts from tax cuts and deregulation but risks from strict border controls.</p>

This statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, comes as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reported that 79 people had been killed in Gaza over the past 24 hours, with 51 deaths occurring near GHF sites. The UN's aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, citing violations of humanitarian principles, as Israel controls who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing mass displacement. The funding and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed to proceed with planned welfare changes despite growing opposition from Labour MPs, who threaten to block plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. Starmer stated that the current welfare system is "unsustainable" and traps people on benefits, and the proposed changes aim to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030. Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch indicated potential support for the reforms but emphasized the need for proof that the proposals would reduce the welfare budget, get more people into work, and avoid raising taxes. The proposed changes involve tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments and scrapping the work capability assessment.</p>
