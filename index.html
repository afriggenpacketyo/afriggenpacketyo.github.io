          <p>The Trump administration is set to pay nearly $5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the January 6th riot at the U.S. Capitol. The settlement resolves a $30 million suit alleging negligence by the Capitol Police officer who shot her as she attempted to breach a broken window. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed disappointment with the settlement, stating it sends a chilling message to law enforcement. The Justice Department had previously cleared the officer of any criminal wrongdoing, determining his actions were in self-defense and lawful under department policy.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced a volatile day, with stocks, bonds, and the dollar initially sliding before recovering. Market jitters were triggered by concerns over government debt, including Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, and a bill in Congress that would make President Trump's tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, acknowledged the Moodyâ€™s downgrade would impact the cost of capital and contribute to market turbulence. Investors are also closely watching negotiations to rein in government spending, as well as signs of potential progress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the collision of a Mexican navy ship with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in the deaths of two sailors and injuries to 19 others. The incident occurred as the ship, CuauhtÃ©moc, was departing from South Street Seaport, causing all three masts to snap off. The NTSB's investigation will examine the crew, the vessel, and environmental conditions, with a preliminary report expected in 30 days. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refuted claims by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that budget cuts may have contributed to the incident, asserting that the Coast Guard was fully supported and the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system was functional.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered Apple to resolve its ongoing dispute with Epic Games over the restoration of Fortnite to the iOS App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple is capable of resolving the issue without further court intervention. If the conflict is not resolved, the Apple official responsible for compliance must personally appear at a hearing scheduled for May 27th. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney claimed Apple is ignoring their Fortnite submission until the Ninth Circuit Court rules on a stay request. The judge noted that the Ninth Circuit has not yet granted Apple a stay of the injunction after 12 days.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants, pending appeal. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, but the court's order was brief and unsigned, without stating reasons. This decision potentially allows the administration to move forward with deportations, while also suggesting that some Venezuelans may still sue to challenge their deportations if they had documentation of legal status before the program's termination. The case challenges Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to terminate the TPS program, which a lower court had blocked.</p>

The 30-year Treasury yield briefly topped 5%, reaching levels not seen since November 2023, before retreating slightly. The downgrade by Moody's, the last of the major rating agencies to take such action, reflects concerns about the U.S.'s fiscal health.

The firm suggests that integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders and homeowners better prepare for weather-related disasters.

The trial centers on allegations that Combs forced or coerced Ventura into sex acts, which he denies. The defense is attempting to undermine Ventura's account, suggesting that drugs and jealousy were the true cause of violence in their relationship.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's takeover of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), stating that the president exceeded his authority. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the firing of USIP's board members and president was unlawful and ordered their reinstatement. The judge also declared that the transfers of the institute's assets were null and void. Howell concluded that USIP is part of the federal government but not the executive branch, supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed into law the Take It Down Act, which criminalizes posting "intimate images" â€“ real or AI-generated â€“ online without an individual's consent. The law also requires technology companies to remove such content within 48 hours. First Lady Melania Trump championed the bill through Congress, emphasizing the need to safeguard children from harmful online behavior. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups argue it's too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate content.</p>

During his time undercover in Syria, Cohen fostered relationships with top Syrian officials and provided valuable intelligence to Israel.

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe, with climate change intensifying droughts and reducing summer rain, leading to a predicted doubling of wildfire risk by 2100. Scientists point to the established link between climate change and elevated fire danger, with increasing urbanization and unmanaged vegetation growth also contributing to the flames. Mediterranean countries are better prepared for fires compared to other European countries. Solutions include controlled burning, restoring ecosystems, and increased public awareness, with landscape planners, foresters, and farmers joining forces.</p>

          <p>Falling behind on a payday loan can lead to the account being sent to a collection agency, resulting in phone calls, letters, and emails demanding payment. Debt collectors may tack on additional fees and interest, increasing the total amount owed. While payday lenders may not report to credit bureaus, collection agencies do, potentially damaging credit scores. In extreme cases, debt collectors may take legal action, garnishing wages or placing liens on bank accounts. Borrowers should request debt validation, understand their rights, and try to negotiate a settlement to manage the situation effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Moody's downgrade of the US government's credit rating, the interest rate on the US government's long-term debt surpassed 5%, the highest level since October 2023, before retreating slightly. The downgrade, citing rising debt, was underscored by Congress advancing a tax-and-spending bill that would add trillions to the US government's $36tn in debt. Historically, US Treasuries have been considered safe, but soaring prices, President Trump's imposition of tariffs, and the rising debt have increased risks. Analysts view the Moody's downgrade as a political assessment, reflecting concerns about the US's capacity to correct its fiscal course. (not investment advice)</p>

Spain's consumer affairs minister emphasized the government's commitment to prioritizing the right to housing over economic interests.

          <p>Homeowners with 100% home equity have the potential to borrow money through home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).

HELOCs and home equity loans offer lower interest rates compared to personal loans and credit cards. Homeowners with 100% equity are less risky borrowers, positioning them for better rate offers and terms. (not investment advice)</p>
