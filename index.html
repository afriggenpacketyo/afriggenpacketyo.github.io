          <p>Two Republican lawmakers are pushing Duke University to end its joint campus program with Wuhan University in China, citing concerns about technology transfer and student manipulation. The congressmen argue that the partnership creates a direct channel between U.S. innovation and China's military complex, potentially using American students as propaganda tools. Duke Kunshan University (DKU), established in 2013, offers students degrees from both Duke and DKU, with opportunities for exchanges at Duke's North Carolina campus. The lawmakers worry that DKU specializes in high-tech fields with military applications, and that its students gain access to federally funded U.S. research.</p>

Thirty-seven countries are participating, including the return of Montenegro and the absence of Moldova due to financial constraints, and Israel's participation is mired in controversy due to calls for its ban amid ongoing conflict, while the "big five" nations (UK, Italy, Spain, France, Germany) plus Switzerland are guaranteed spots in the final.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the war began, though expectations for significant progress are low. While President Trump supports the negotiations, President Zelensky has expressed doubts about Russia's seriousness and the organization of the talks. A Turkish official confirmed that U.S. envoys are in Istanbul, but the Trump administration downplays the likelihood of a breakthrough without direct engagement between Trump and Putin. This article suggests Putin aims to appease Trump and convince the White House that Ukraine is the obstacle to peace, potentially seeking a deal favorable to the Kremlin.</p>

Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP sponsoring the bill, asserts it is stronger and addresses shortcomings in existing laws. The bill has undergone scrutiny and changes, including removing the need for High Court judge approval, instead proposing a panel of experts. The government revised its estimate of assisted deaths in the first year, prompting criticism of the process as "chaotic".</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill. This "bonus" aims to help retirees keep more money and is presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The deduction would be available to those 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples over $150,000. While it would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is not as generous as a tax credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's denunciation of "activist judges" echoes a long history of presidents criticizing the judiciary, though his approach is notably vocal. While the Constitution establishes an independent judiciary, presidents and members of Congress have often criticized court decisions they disagree with. The term "judicial activism" has evolved over time, with both Democratic and Republican presidents accusing courts of overstepping their constitutional role. Trump's criticism marks a particularly politicized phase, where judicial rulings are frequently contested and used as political fodder.</p>

          <p>President Trump's immigration policies are facing resistance from federal judges, particularly regarding expedited deportations of illegal Venezuelan migrants. These courts are questioning the administration's limited due process for these migrants, raising constitutional concerns about the executive branch's authority over foreign relations and national security. The Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, typically reserved for declared wars or invasions, is also under scrutiny. The article argues that federal judges are overstepping by challenging the president's authority in matters of war and national security.</p>

          <p>Despite abortion remaining legal in many states, clinics are closing due to financial and operational challenges. At least 17 clinics closed last year and another 17 have closed in the first five months of this year, including in states with strong reproductive rights protections. Rising costs, limited reimbursement rates, and growing demand for telehealth services contribute to the closures.

          <p>For those exploring their queerness, finding a supportive community can be affirming. It's okay to experience impostor syndrome and narrowing down what you're looking for is important, whether that's shared racial identity, neurotype, or hobbies. Don't be afraid to try new things, like queer bowling or a zine-making night, and ask a queer friend to join you if you're nervous. If you can't find the right network, consider creating your own space, or connect with others online. The journey of finding your people is a process, but know that you will eventually find them.</p>

The White House argues that the actions of the Tren de Aragua gang constitute an invasion, while the intelligence community does not believe the Venezuelan government controls the gang.
