          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs is set to face trial in New York, with jury selection beginning Monday, on charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, which could lead to a life sentence if convicted. In addition to the criminal case, Combs is facing numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of drugging, assaulting, and sexually assaulting individuals. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and has dismissed the lawsuits as attempts for a quick payday, despite facing significant evidence and numerous accusers. The trial is expected to last several weeks, with the prosecution presenting its case over three weeks and the defense needing a week for their presentation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, citing a national security threat and claiming that the U.S. movie industry is dying. He believes other countries are offering incentives to draw filmmakers and studios away from the U.S., devastating Hollywood and other areas within the country. The announcement comes amid criticism of Trump's aggressive trade policies and China's recent decision to reduce the number of U.S. films it imports. It remains unclear how these tariffs would be applied and whether they would affect television series production.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the former prison on an island near San Francisco, to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders, symbolizing law, order, and justice. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with all Presidential Orders, though the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz, now a popular national park and tourist attraction, remain uncertain. Trump's decision stems from frustrations with courts insisting on due process for those being deported, as he seeks to send accused gang members to prisons in El Salvador. Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, once housed infamous criminals like Al Capone.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) headquarters honoring victims of gun violence has been removed, confirmed by the Department of Justice, with an online version also taken down. The exhibit featured portraits of 120 people killed by gun violence, including victims of mass shootings, domestic violence, suicide, and law enforcement officers. A DOJ spokesperson indicated that the ATF will continue to honor victims of violent crime but not exclusively those affected by gun violence. Advocates view the removal as a political decision reflecting the Trump administration's efforts to roll back firearms regulations, expressing concern about a potential rise in gun violence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for rejecting his offer to send U.S. troops into Mexico to combat drug cartels, stating she is fearful of the cartels. Trump's comments follow Sheinbaum's confirmation that he proposed a larger role for the U.S. military in Mexico during a recent call, which she declined, emphasizing Mexican sovereignty. Trump insists that the U.S. military is needed to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States, while Sheinbaum maintains that both countries can collaborate within their respective territories. Trump has also linked his efforts to reduce fentanyl flow to his tariff plan, seeking to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 100% tariff on films produced overseas to incentivize movie production in the U.S., addressing the migration of high-paying jobs to countries offering tax benefits. The proposal aims to boost Hollywood, which has suffered from production declines and job losses, though details on implementation remain unclear. Movie executives expressed confusion on how the tariff would be applied, given the global nature of film production. Trump's initiative follows the appointment of actors as "special ambassadors" to Hollywood and efforts to offer federal tax incentives to win back offshore business.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's policies and persona are influencing global elections, noting that right-wing parties borrowing from the MAGA playbook were punished in recent Canadian and Australian elections, while the impact is more complex elsewhere. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an anti-Trump message, and in Australia, conservative leaders struggled to shake off associations with Trump. However, in Germany, the Trump factor has been less direct but still felt, as leaders use the uncertainty of American commitment to mutual defense to justify policy changes.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that 2024 was the deadliest year for Russian forces in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, with at least 45,287 soldiers killed, nearly three times more than in the first year. The analysis, based on open-source data, reveals that Russia lost approximately 27 lives for every kilometer of Ukrainian territory captured, with the deadliest day occurring on February 20 due to a Ukrainian HIMARS missile strike on a training ground. Despite these losses, Russia has managed to replenish its forces through increased recruitment and financial incentives, with volunteers, including those seeking to avoid criminal prosecution, making up a significant portion of casualties.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist aligned with Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement, won the first round of Romania's presidential election rerun, opposing EU leadership and military aid to Ukraine. The election, annulled due to concerns over Russian interference, sets Simion against pro-EU Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan in a runoff, raising concerns in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow. Simion's rise reflects popular anger over high inflation and conspiracy theories, with his potential victory threatening Romania's support for Ukraine and its pro-Western stance.</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes more popular, some experts are cautioning women about relying on the medical procedure, citing its high costs and lack of guarantees. The process involves financial costs, medical risks, and a gamble that it will work, with success rates dropping as women age and the number of eggs frozen decreases. Some critics argue that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be doing so to retain female employees rather than to help them, and that the emphasis on profits in private equity-backed fertility companies is creating warped incentives.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular among women to preserve their fertility, but it is an expensive procedure with no guarantee of success. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, with a single cycle costing thousands of dollars. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, many women pay out of pocket, and experts caution that it does not ensure a woman will be able to have a child. Women are encouraged to discuss egg freezing with their gynecologists to make informed decisions about their fertility options.</p>
