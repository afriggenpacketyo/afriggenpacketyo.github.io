          <p>New Jersey Transit's locomotive engineers initiated a strike at midnight after negotiations with state leaders collapsed, disrupting the commutes of tens of thousands in the New York City metropolitan region. The union is picketing at key locations, demanding pay parity with Amtrak and other commuter railroads. NJ Transit's CEO expressed willingness to return to the bargaining table, while Governor Murphy monitored the situation closely. The strike, the first since 1983, impacts commuters traveling to Manhattan, Newark, and Hoboken, with contingency plans only accommodating a fraction of displaced riders. The disruption is expected to ripple across other transit systems, causing congestion and impacting air travel to Newark Liberty Airport, as well as attendance at events at the Prudential Center and MetLife Stadium.</p>

Comey removed the post, stating he didn't realize the association with violence and replaced it with a new message.

          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its global production facilities with Chinese state-owned firm Dongfeng as part of a broader restructuring plan. This move comes as Nissan faces financial difficulties, including significant job cuts and factory closures, due to weak sales in key markets. The company aims to reduce its global production by a fifth and has already announced substantial layoffs. Nissan has a long-standing partnership with Dongfeng in China and hopes to leverage this relationship to improve its global operations. The company recently secured funding for a new battery plant in Sunderland, UK, to support its electric vehicle production.</p>

          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, lost his appeal against a defamation judgment that found he committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The original ruling stated that news articles alleging he murdered four unarmed Afghans were true.

The case, dubbed "the trial of the century," lasted over 120 days and cost an estimated A$35 million. The court's decision upholds the initial verdict, further impacting Roberts-Smith's reputation and legacy.</p>

          <p>Lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges to hear divisive political issues, aiming for nationwide impact. A CBS News analysis reveals that conservatives often file cases against the Biden administration in small Texas federal courts, ensuring Republican appointees make the initial rulings. Conversely, liberals filed cases in larger venues within the 9th Circuit during the Trump administration. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should dictate national policy through nationwide injunctions. This trend erodes confidence in the courts, as the public perceives circuit judges as extensions of the political process.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura faced intense cross-examination in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, with defense attorneys using archived text messages to question her credibility and portray her as a willing participant in their sexual activities. The defense insists that Ventura was not a victim of sexual assault or trafficking, while Combs maintains his innocence. Text messages showing mutual affection and Ventura's apparent willingness to engage in "freak-offs" were presented. Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade but testified that she began to see a violent and coercive side of him. The trial continues with concerns about Ventura's pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. This contraction was more significant than economists had anticipated, with uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies affecting Japan's export-dependent economy. Despite the contraction, domestic demand showed a positive trend, growing by 0.6%. The Bank of Japan held steady at its current interest rates and is expected to maintain this stance in the near term. The central bank has cautioned about the potential impact of trade policies on Japan's economic activity and prices.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) withheld the diploma of a student, Logan Rozos, who used his graduation speech to condemn the U.S. for supporting what he termed a "genocide" in Gaza. The university accused Rozos of misrepresenting his intended speech to express personal political views. NYU is one of ten universities under investigation by Trump's antisemitism taskforce for campus incidents since the start of the Israel-Gaza war. This action raises concerns about free speech on college campuses amidst increased scrutiny and political tensions.</p>

          <p>In light of President Trump's assertion of unprecedented executive powers, a contributor argues that the Supreme Court should maintain the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against unconstitutional government actions. The cases before the court involve Trump's order to eliminate birthright citizenship, a move seen as blatantly unconstitutional. Ending nationwide injunctions would create inconsistent laws and weaken the judiciary's ability to check presidential overreach. The contributor emphasizes the importance of federal courts in upholding the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A man was apprehended at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry after attempting to smuggle six parrots into California by concealing them in his boots. Customs and Border Protection officers discovered the birds after noticing unusual bulges around the man's ankles. The incident highlights the dangers of animal smuggling, as birds can carry diseases that threaten native wildlife and agricultural industries. Similar attempts have been thwarted at U.S.-Mexico border crossings, underscoring ongoing efforts to prevent illegal wildlife trafficking.</p>
