          <p>Senate Democrats are expressing opposition to a crypto regulation bill, citing concerns about President Trump's and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, but Democrats are pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets. The concerns stem from the announcement that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. Senator Jeff Merkley has introduced a bill to prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.

The administration's actions are viewed as an effort to punish liberal institutions for their political leanings, rather than genuinely addressing concerns about discrimination.</p>
