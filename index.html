          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, the Trump administration and corporate leaders announced over $90 billion in private investments for Pennsylvania, aimed at fostering a new economy based on artificial intelligence and energy. The plan includes building energy-intensive data centers for AI and an innovation hub to train workers, leveraging the state's natural gas and nuclear resources. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event highlighted a vision for regional economic growth, with supporters like PNC's CEO noting the area's unique combination of technology, energy, and labor. The announcement faced some local protests from activists concerned about its focus on fossil fuels and corporate interests.</p>

          <p>Robin Kaye, a music supervisor for "American Idol," and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found shot to death in their Encino, California, home. Police have arrested a 22-year-old suspect, alleging he was burglarizing the residence when the couple returned home, leading to a fatal struggle. The incident is believed to have occurred days before the discovery, after police responded to initial burglary calls but could not enter the fortified property. Authorities believe the crime was a random burglary rather than a targeted attack, and "American Idol" representatives expressed devastation over the loss of a long-time colleague.</p>

          <h2>Brazilian Prosecutor Recommends Jair Bolsonaro Be Convicted for Coup Attempt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor has formally requested that the Supreme Federal Court find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to violently overthrow the democratic order. The charges stem from Bolsonaro's unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison, while he maintains the accusations are a politically motivated "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>The UK government established a secret scheme to relocate 4,500 Afghans to the UK after an official inadvertently leaked the personal data of nearly 19,000 applicants seeking refuge. The breach, which occurred in 2022, exposed individuals to potential harm from the Taliban, prompting the creation of the clandestine £400m Afghan Relocation Route. The government obtained a super-injunction to prevent media reporting on the leak and the subsequent relocation efforts, a gagging order that was just lifted by a High Court judge. Defence Secretary John Healey has issued a "sincere apology" for the "serious departmental error," though many at-risk individuals remain in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six federal charges, including murder and stalking, for a shooting spree that killed former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and injured State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. In a letter from jail, Boelter claimed his motivations were not related to his views on Donald Trump or abortion, suggesting information would emerge about events from the preceding 24 months. Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson described the incident as "targeted political assassinations" that shook the state.

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the Genius Act, bipartisan legislation that would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules, potentially allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, which promise faster and cheaper transactions. Proponents, like financial tech company Circle, view them as "digital dollars" that can operate outside traditional banking hours. However, risks remain, such as the potential for a stablecoin to "depeg" from its asset, as seen during the 2023 bank failures. (not investment advice)</p>

His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit found he was factually innocent.

The report also advises that associates wear standardized uniforms and not be responsible for diagnosing patients, following tragic cases where misdiagnoses by PAs led to patient deaths. The recommendations aim to clarify the roles and responsibilities of these positions as their numbers are set to significantly increase within the NHS.</p>

The accusation appears to stem from a Fannie Mae memo that noted Schiff designated homes in both Maryland and California as primary residences at different times, but did not use the word "fraud." Schiff's spokesperson stated he has always been transparent about owning two homes and has followed all legal requirements.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo was hacked, with the perpetrator posting "disgusting" antisemitic and racist content. A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the show, condemned the abhorrent messages and confirmed the account has since been secured. The posts, which included slurs and commentary on political figures, were quickly removed but highlighted ongoing concerns about hate speech on the platform. The incident comes as the Anti-Defamation League reports a significant rise in antisemitic incidents across the U.S., and follows other instances of problematic content on X.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney's office announced a six-count federal indictment against Vance Boelter for the targeted shootings of Minnesota lawmakers, calling it the first step in potentially seeking the death penalty. The indictment charges Boelter with the murders of Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the attempted murder of John Hoffman and his wife. Prosecutors also revealed a letter Boelter wrote after the attacks, in which he made bizarre claims of being a secret military operative and alleged that Governor Tim Walz had asked him to assassinate other politicians. The decision on whether to pursue capital punishment will be made by the Attorney General.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to "come forward and explain" the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, signaling a break with President Trump on the issue. Johnson stated he is in favor of transparency and "we should put everything out there," a sentiment echoed by other Republicans like Rep. Tim Burchett and Sen. Josh Hawley. The calls for clarity follow a DOJ memo stating no "client list" was found, which angered many Trump supporters who were promised full disclosure.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has ordered crews of the KC-46 Pegasus tanker to curtail the use of its onboard auxiliary power unit (APU) following a series of premature failures. The APU is a small turbine that provides electricity and allows the aircraft to start its main engines without ground support equipment. This new restriction forces the tankers to rely on ground power carts, increasing their logistical footprint and undermining a key capability for operating in remote locations. This is the latest in a series of persistent technical problems for the KC-46, including issues with its refueling boom and remote vision system.</p>

This research into detailed governance models, including variations of the "one country, two systems" framework, has intensified since a key 2019 speech by President Xi Jinping. The academic work explores potential political structures and legal frameworks for the island, a shift from the previously broader, less detailed official rhetoric. This trend corresponds with rising cross-strait tensions, as Taiwan's government pursues a pro-independence stance and maintains strong ties with Washington.</p>

The uptick, which includes four shootings in a recent two-week span, comes even as overall violent crime in the city is decreasing.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is systematically weakening the federal government's ability to respond to disasters, with FEMA's leadership and mission in disarray. The article points to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's stated desire to eliminate or redeploy the agency, and highlights recent failures, such as delayed responses to Texas floods. The critique asserts that beyond FEMA, the administration is gutting crucial related functions, including climate change research, infrastructure grant programs, and weather forecasting services at NOAA. This dismantling of federal capacity leaves states and communities more vulnerable to extreme weather events.</p>

This move comes after President Trump gave Russia a 50-day ultimatum to negotiate a peace deal or face severe tariffs.
