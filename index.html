          <h2>Wreckage of Danish Slave Ships Discovered off Costa Rica</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 19:04:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks found off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which were wrecked in 1710. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum confirmed the ships' identities through investigations of ship timbers, cargo bricks, and clay pipes discovered during underwater excavations. The ships were initially mistaken for pirate vessels until yellow bricks were found in one of the wrecks in 2015, prompting further investigation. The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792, but slavery was not abolished until 1847.</p>

          <p>A leading health think tank reports that urgent and emergency care in England is performing significantly worse than before the pandemic. A&E waiting times have reached a record high, and delays in discharging patients from hospitals contribute to bottlenecks. While flu cases were higher than usual, they were comparable to the winter of 2022-23. The think tank urges the NHS to prepare for such winters and address underlying issues instead of blaming external factors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings are declining as he approaches his 100th day in office, with a majority of Americans disapproving of his handling of the presidency, according to recent polls. His approval rating, hovering between 39% and 45% in three different surveys, is the lowest for any newly elected president at this milestone in over seven decades. These ratings mark a significant shift from the uptick in favorability Trump experienced upon returning to the White House in January.</p>

A judge has temporarily halted the cuts, and a hearing is scheduled to determine if the firings can proceed.
