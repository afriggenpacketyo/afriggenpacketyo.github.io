          <p>John Woeltz, a 37-year-old cryptocurrency investor, has been charged with kidnapping and torturing a man in a Manhattan townhouse for three weeks in an attempt to obtain his Bitcoin password. The victim, a 28-year-old from Italy, was allegedly beaten, shocked with electric wires, and threatened with death after arriving in New York on May 6. Police found Polaroid pictures of the victim bound and assaulted, along with a gun and other torture devices, in the residence. Woeltz and another person, Beatrice Folchi, were arrested, highlighting a disturbing trend of attacks against crypto executives. (Optimism score is based on the fact that the victim survived, so there is hope for the victim to recover from this trauma and justice to be served in court).</p>

          <p>Nearly a third of the 260 miners trapped underground following an accident at a Sibanye-Stillwater gold mine in South Africa have been safely brought to the surface. The miners were stuck after the hoist system used to access a shaft at the Kloof gold mine was damaged. While there were no fatalities or injuries, the National Union of Mineworkers emphasized concerns about the miners' well-being after being without food and water for 24 hours. This incident underscores the risks associated with deep-level mining in South Africa, where mining accidents are not uncommon.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The images, taken by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution using advanced deep-sea imaging technology, reveal the submarine's final resting place over 1,300 feet below the ocean's surface. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship, USS F-3, during exercises on the ocean's surface off San Diego eight days before Christmas in 1917. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950, and held a remembrance ceremony for the lost crew members.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, designed to circumvent the United Nations and undermine Hamas, was conceived and largely developed by Israeli officials. The plan involves newly formed private organizations, mainly run by American contractors, to distribute food, with security provided by a former C.I.A. officer. Israeli officials claim this will prevent aid from falling into the wrong hands, while U.N. officials warn it could restrict aid to limited areas and displace civilians.

          <p>Russian aerial attacks on Ukraine have resulted in at least 13 deaths and 56 civilian injuries since Friday, with Kyiv experiencing one of its biggest combined aerial assaults since the war began. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks, stating that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow. The strikes occurred as Russia and Ukraine participated in prisoner swaps agreed upon after talks in Turkey. The overnight barrage caused fires and explosions across Kyiv, damaging homes, businesses, and infrastructure.</p>
