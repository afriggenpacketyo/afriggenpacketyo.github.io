          <p>House Republicans, led by Rep. Julie Fedorchak, are voicing concerns about President Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina, fearing it could negatively impact the American ranching industry. The lawmakers are seeking clarity on safety and inspection standards for imported beef, emphasizing the need for them to match the rigorous standards of the U.S. industry. The White House maintains its commitment to addressing the concerns of American cattle producers and safeguarding their interests. The proposal has sparked debate among Republicans, with some expressing significant reservations and others acknowledging the need to address cattle shortages in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal agents conducted a joint Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation on Canal Street in New York City, targeting criminal activity related to selling counterfeit goods. The operation led to vendors attempting to flee the area and protesters gathering in response. One protester was arrested for assaulting a federal officer, according to the Department of Homeland Security. City Hall officials stated they do not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters and emphasized the focus should be on violent criminals, while the NYPD stated they had no involvement in the federal operation.</p>

          <p>A criminologist predicts that French authorities will likely apprehend the thieves who stole crown jewels from the Louvre Museum, but recovering the treasures is unlikely. The robbers left DNA at the scene, including on a crown they left behind, and police recovered tools used in the heist. The stolen jewels, including a tiara with pearls and diamonds, are estimated to be worth $102 million, but experts say they would still be worth millions if broken up and sold on the black market. The theft has raised concerns about the Louvre's security vulnerabilities, with a recent audit noting a lack of security cameras in some areas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The French Ministry of Culture stated that the jewels stolen from the Louvre Museum were not privately insured due to French law prohibiting insuring state property unless it leaves the museum. The prosecutor investigating the theft estimates the jewels' worth at $102 million, excluding their historical value. Experts suggest the jewels could be broken up and sold for millions on the black market. The heist has raised concerns about security vulnerabilities at the Louvre, with a security audit revealing a lack of camera surveillance in some areas of the Denon Wing where the jewels were displayed.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight diverted to Salt Lake City after pilots discovered a crack in the windshield, potentially caused by a collision with a weather balloon. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, examining the windshield and speaking with the pilots. The CEO of WindBorne Systems believes one of the company's weather balloons struck the aircraft and is cooperating with the NTSB and FAA in the investigation. The company has implemented a software change to minimize time at active flight levels and is manually checking airborne balloons.</p>

          <p>A major study by 22 public service media organizations, including DW, found that AI assistants misrepresent news content 45% of the time. The study evaluated the responses of ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini, and Perplexity AI, finding significant issues with accuracy, sourcing, and context. The study confirms that AI assistants systematically distort news content, endangering public trust. The broadcasters are calling for governments and AI companies to take action to ensure the integrity of news.</p>

          <p>Despite rocky trade relations, President Trump has shown restraint by not antagonizing Xi Jinping or challenging Beijing's red lines. Analysts suggest that Trump's control over his administration and team of China hawks makes leader-to-leader diplomacy crucial. The American leader could prove to be a unique guard rail for Sino-US relations. Tensions persist due to the structural competition between the two powers, but Trump's personal approach may help manage the relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he did not want a "wasted meeting" after plans for face-to-face talks with Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine were put on hold. The decision was made due to key differences between US and Russian proposals for peace, particularly Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line. European leaders released a statement saying that any talks on ending the war should start with freezing the current front line. Trump had previously discussed a summit with Putin before meeting with Zelensky.</p>

          <p>A study by Schroders found that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before age 70, forgoing higher monthly payments. The decision is driven by financial realities, with many needing the income immediately upon retiring due to a shortfall in their own retirement savings. Concerns about the future of Social Security also contribute to the decision to claim benefits early. The study highlights the need for better retirement planning and addressing the financial challenges facing many workers.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to head the Office of Special Counsel, has been revealed to have made numerous offensive and extremist comments. The revealed group chat to Politico this week revealed several other nasty comments Ingrassia made, including: “Never trust a chinaman or Indian,” musings about the “natural state” of “Blacks,” and a demand that Martin Luther King Jr Day should “be eviscerated.” Ingrassia also used an Italian slur to refer to Black people, went so far as to declare that “the founding fathers were wrong that all men are created equal,” and said: “I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time, I will admit it.” He has been serving as a de facto "loyalty enforcer" within the administration, vetting appointees and staffing key agencies. Ingrassia's rise reveals much about the moral economy of the second Trump administration.</p>
