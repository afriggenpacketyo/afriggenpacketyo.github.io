      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>U.S. inflation eased to 2.8% in February, below expectations.  The CPI rose 0.2%, down from January's 0.5%. Core CPI also increased by 0.2%, reaching 3.1% annually. Economists anticipate the Fed to hold interest rates for now, but potentially ease them later in 2025 due to easing inflation and growth risks.  The report follows concerns about the impact of tariffs on inflation.</p>
