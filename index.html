          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear reactors in the United States. The orders call for a comprehensive reform of the NRC, mandating decisions on reactor licenses within 18 months. These actions also establish a regulatory framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to construct nuclear reactors on federal land, separate from NRC oversight, to power critical defense facilities and AI data centers. Trump emphasized support for both small, advanced reactors and large plants, while nuclear executives, including Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez, attended the signing ceremony, resulting in a rally for nuclear stocks.</p>

          <p>A verdict has been reached in the trial concerning the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris, where nine men and one woman were accused of involvement. Five masked men, posing as police officers, allegedly stormed Kardashian's hotel suite and stole valuables worth at least $6 million, including a $4 million diamond engagement ring given by Kanye West. During the trial, Kardashian testified emotionally, stating she believed she was going to be sexually assaulted and killed. The trial concluded with eight of the ten defendants being found guilty and facing varying consequences, while two were acquitted.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) has reached a non-prosecution agreement with Boeing, allowing the aerospace giant to avoid criminal charges related to the two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. Under the agreement, Boeing will avoid being labeled a felon, preventing a trial scheduled for next month. The DOJ believes the agreement is a fair resolution that serves the public interest, guaranteeing further accountability and immediate benefits from Boeing. This agreement comes after Boeing reached a settlement in 2021, agreeing to pay a $2.51 billion fine to avoid prosecution, which included compensation for crash victims' families and airline customers.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court ruling blocked the nation's first religious charter school from opening in Oklahoma, but a school voucher movement is gaining momentum. The House passed legislation allocating $5 billion for K-12 private school tuition, homeschooling, or virtual learning, potentially reaching one million students. This bill could bring vouchers to states like New York and California that have resisted the concept. The program is structured as a tax credit, offering a dollar-for-dollar write-off for donations to nonprofits granting private education scholarships, which could be popular with wealthy taxpayers.</p>

Johan Helberg, the homeowner, was alerted by a neighbor and found the ship towering over his house, missing his bedroom by only a few yards. Police are investigating the incident, focusing on the officer's admission of falling asleep prior to the crash. No injuries or oil spills were reported, and authorities are working to refloat the vessel. The ship had 16 crew members on board, including a Norwegian captain and a crew of Russians and Ukrainians.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed budget bill includes new tax rules that could significantly impact millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The "No Tax on Tips" provision would create a tax deduction, eliminating federal income taxes on tips for those earning less than $160,000 in 2025, but it expires after 2028. Similarly, a tax break for overtime pay would allow workers to claim a deduction, subject to certain restrictions and guidelines determined by the Treasury Department. While these provisions could increase take-home pay, some experts caution that low-income workers may not benefit, and the bill includes cuts to social safety net programs.

          <p>Disney has sued YouTube and former Disney executive Justin Connolly for breach of contract after YouTube hired Connolly to be its head of media and sports. Disney alleges that Connolly violated an employment agreement that did not expire until March 2027, and that Connolly oversaw Disneyâ€™s negotiations for a licensing deal renewal with YouTube. Disney is seeking a preliminary injunction against Connolly and YouTube to enforce its employment contract. YouTube has become an increasingly formidable competitor to streaming services and entertainment studios, providing videos from amateur and professional creators, as well as livestreaming major events and NFL games.</p>

          <p>Six people are presumed dead after a Cessna 550 jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego County amid dense fog. The NTSB is investigating the crash, which occurred after the plane hit power lines about two miles from the airport. The plane was approaching Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport after taking off from New Jersey and stopping in Wichita, Kansas. Poor weather conditions, including dense fog with visibility as low as a quarter of a mile, are being considered as contributing factors. At least two victims have been identified as employees of Sound Talent Group.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed several executive orders designed to promote nuclear power development, aiming to "usher in the American nuclear renaissance." The orders will expedite nuclear reactor testing, streamline application processes, and allow the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land. These actions also seek to overhaul the Nuclear Reactor Commission and encourage uranium mining and enrichment. Officials emphasized the importance of nuclear energy for American energy dominance and national security, particularly in the context of the AI race with China. The administration hopes to test and deploy nuclear reactors before the president's term concludes.</p>

          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt, typically after 180 days of non-payment, carries significant financial consequences, including severe damage to credit scores and potential lawsuits. While one missed payment can impact credit, default leads to charge-off and possible sale to a collection agency. Consumers can explore options like hardship programs, credit counseling, or debt settlement to avoid default. A defaulted account can remain on credit reports for up to seven years, affecting loan approvals and rental applications. Consumers facing lawsuits may consider bankruptcy for protection and debt restructuring. (not investment advice)</p>

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that income for the bottom 10% of households would fall, while the top 10% would see an income boost.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to send hundreds of border agents to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in arresting unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. interior. This plan involves approximately 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), including Border Patrol agents and members of the Office of Field Operations and Air and Marine Operations. CBP agents will support ICE's 25 field offices in targeting and arresting immigrants in the country illegally. The effort highlights the administration's focus on interior enforcement amid a historic drop in illegal crossings at the southern border.</p>
