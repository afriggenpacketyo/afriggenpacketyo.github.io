          <p>Police in Chandler, Arizona, have recommended a felony child abuse charge against Brady Kiser following the drowning death of his 3-year-old son, Trigg. The boy, son of popular influencer Emilie Kiser, was found unresponsive in the family's pool in May and died the next day. The Maricopa County Attorney's Office will make the final decision on whether to file formal charges against the father. This case has drawn significant attention due to the family's large social media presence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, surprising economists who had anticipated a 0.2% increase. This flat reading for both headline and core PPI presents a conflicting signal regarding the impact of tariffs on the economy, especially when compared to the recent rise in consumer prices. Despite the monthly stagnation, the annual PPI rate was 2.3%, still above the Federal Reserve's target. This data further solidifies expectations that the Fed will not cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation rose to a 2.7% annual rate in June, the highest level since February. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.3%, driven by rising costs for food and energy. So-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 2.9% over the last year. The data suggests that recent tariffs may be starting to impact consumer prices, making a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July highly unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, investors are exploring various purchasing options, including major retailers like Costco and traditional gold investment companies. This article examines the trade-offs, noting that Costco offers convenience and lower markups but has limited selection and no buyback program. In contrast, specialized firms provide a wider range of investment products and strategies but may come with higher markups and sales pressure. The choice depends on an investor's specific goals, experience level, and desire for either simplicity or a broader set of financial tools. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has imposed a £42 million fine on Barclays for significant failures in its anti-money laundering controls. The regulator found that the bank did not conduct proper due diligence on two clients, which facilitated the movement of funds linked to financial crime. The FCA noted that Barclays' lack of checks on one firm, WealthTek, created an increased risk of client money misappropriation. Barclays received a reduced fine due to its cooperation and a voluntary payment made to affected clients.</p>

          <p>French automaker Renault saw its shares plunge by as much as 18% after the company lowered its 2025 financial outlook and announced a leadership change.

          <p>Professional cycling teams in the 2025 Tour de France are increasingly adopting heat training to boost performance, even in moderate temperatures. Sports scientists explain that deliberately raising an athlete's core body temperature, either actively or passively, can improve performance by increasing blood volume and stimulating red blood cell formation. This method is considered by some experts to be more effective and accessible than traditional altitude training. The practice, once seen as unconventional, is now a mainstream strategy for gaining a competitive edge in endurance sports.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing that the fragile peace in northern Ethiopia could collapse, as reports of troop movements and political turmoil in the Tigray region emerge. The region is still recovering from a brutal two-year civil war that ended in 2022, but the peace remains precarious, partly because Eritrea was not part of the negotiations. Observers note that Eritrea, which supported Ethiopian forces during the war, may be exploiting a recent fracture within the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). This internal division is fueling fears of a return to violence.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife after she was suspended for complaining about sharing a female changing room with a transgender doctor. The internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support allegations of misconduct, which included misgendering the doctor. The decision was announced as an employment tribunal, where Peggie is suing the health board and the doctor for unlawful discrimination, resumed. The case highlights the ongoing debate in the UK regarding trans rights and single-sex spaces.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has called on Israeli authorities to conduct an "aggressive investigation" into the killing of a 20-year-old Palestinian-American in the occupied West Bank. Sayfollah Musallet was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers on Friday, an act Huckabee described as a "criminal and terrorist act." The victim, a dual U.S. citizen from Florida, was visiting family when the attack occurred. The demand for accountability from the U.S. ambassador marks a significant response to the incident amid ongoing settler violence.</p>

          <p>In a notable shift, a leading Chinese state-run newspaper published an editorial expressing support for the country's major internet platform companies. The article emphasized that innovations in areas like food delivery are just as important to China as "hard-tech" breakthroughs in sectors like aerospace. This friendly tone reflects Beijing's recent efforts to ease its regulatory crackdown on the tech sector. The editorial argues that China needs both critical technologies and the consumer-facing innovations that improve daily life and create employment.</p>

          <p>Retail giant Target is experiencing a period of stagnation, marked by slowing sales, falling stock prices, and a weakening of the unique brand identity that once set it apart. Customers and analysts point to issues like merchandise being less unique, slipping store standards, and inventory problems as contributing factors. The company has also been caught in cultural debates over its diversity and inclusion policies, which has alienated some shoppers. As Target attempts a turnaround, it faces stiff competition and the challenge of recapturing its "cheap chic" appeal.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the NHS in England has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to clarify their roles and prevent confusion with doctors. The review also suggests they wear standardized uniforms and only see patients with minor ailments in certain settings. These recommendations follow safety concerns and the deaths of patients who were treated by PAs they believed were qualified doctors. The review aims to establish a clear national vision for these roles, which it says was previously lacking.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive deportation policy is creating conflict with U.S. industries, such as agriculture and hospitality, that rely on immigrant labor. Despite concerns from business leaders about labor shortages, the administration's hardline stance continues to prioritize mass deportations. This article argues the policy is based on the flawed premise that a large pool of American workers is ready to fill these physically demanding, low-wage jobs. Economists warn that mass deportations could lead to reduced production, higher consumer prices, and an overall shrinkage of the job supply.</p>
