          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that by many measures, equity prices appear to be at elevated levels. Speaking in Rhode Island, he clarified that while the central bank monitors overall financial conditions, it does not currently see a period of high financial stability risks. Powell acknowledged that markets anticipate the Fed's policy moves, pricing in expected interest rate changes, which has contributed to stocks reaching record highs following the recent rate cut. His comments provide insight into the Fed's perspective on current market valuations amid its policy decisions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly advised pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol, suggesting a link to autism, while acknowledging his statements were based on personal opinion rather than scientific evidence. His remarks directly contradicted guidance from his own Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and were immediately challenged by major medical groups. Health organizations stressed that acetaminophen, Tylenol's active ingredient, is considered the only safe over-the-counter pain reliever during pregnancy and warned of the dangers of untreated fevers for both mother and child. The incident has raised concerns about the administration's promotion of unverified medical claims.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that its Artemis II mission, which will send four astronauts on a flight around the Moon, could launch as early as February 2026, ahead of its previous schedule. This 10-day mission will be the first time humans have traveled beyond low-Earth orbit in over 50 years. The accelerated timeline reflects the agency's progress in preparing the spacecraft and rocket systems, as it aims to win what officials are calling a "second space race" against China, which also plans to land astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030.</p>

          <p>A man who repeatedly stalked singer Cheryl Tweedy has been sentenced to 12 months in jail for breaching a restraining order. Daniel Bannister appeared at the pop star's home for the fourth time, causing significant distress to her and her young child. In a victim impact statement read in court, Tweedy said the incidents left her feeling nervous and on edge, and that Bannister's actions had frightened her child. The judge, in sentencing, noted Bannister's defiance of previous court orders meant to protect the singer.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Households Face Higher Home Heating Costs This Winter, Study Predicts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 12:36:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new forecast predicts that Americans will face significantly higher costs to heat their homes this winter, with the average energy bill expected to rise by 7.6%. The study, from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, attributes the increase to soaring prices for both natural gas and electricity. This projected rise in winter heating expenses comes after a summer of record-high air-conditioning costs, further straining household budgets and contributing to a 31% increase in unpaid utility bills since the end of last year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data indicates that the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. is losing steam. In July, rents increased by just 2.3% compared to the previous year, a rate that is slower than the pre-pandemic average and a significant cooldown from the rapid increases seen in recent years. While some markets like Chicago continue to experience strong growth, others that were previously booming, such as Miami, have seen rent growth flatten completely. This trend suggests that landlords' pricing power may be diminishing as consumer finances become more constrained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's address to the United Nations General Assembly has drawn sharp criticism from political analysts and diplomats, who described it as bizarre, incoherent, and embarrassing for the United States. The speech was characterized by strange falsehoods, attacks on allies, and self-aggrandizing claims, including a renewed plea for a Nobel Peace Prize. The article highlights commentary from observers who noted the stark contrast between Trump's claims of increased international respect for the U.S. and the reality of his alienating rhetoric on the world stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has increased the probability of a government shutdown by abruptly canceling a planned negotiating session with top congressional Democrats. The meeting was intended to address funding ahead of the October 1 deadline. In a social media post, Trump called the Democrats' demands "unserious and ridiculous" and declared that a meeting would not be productive. In response, Democratic leaders accused the president of throwing a tantrum and stated that he will "own the shutdown" if one occurs due to the breakdown in talks.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are reportedly engaging in "financial nihilism," a trend characterized by making high-risk bets on speculative assets like cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and sports gambling. This behavior is driven by a widespread feeling that traditional avenues to financial security, such as homeownership and stable career paths, are increasingly unattainable due to economic pressures like inflation, debt, and a tight job market. Consequently, many are "swinging for the fences" with risky investments in hopes of a life-changing windfall, despite the significant potential for losses.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles. The administration had frozen the funds, which were designated for hundreds of medical research projects, over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action on campus. In granting a preliminary injunction, the judge ruled that the government likely violated federal law by suspending the grants without providing specific procedures or explanations for its actions.</p>
