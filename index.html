          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, has been taken into custody and faces charges of murder and attempted murder. The shootings occurred early Saturday morning, with Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark killed, and Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette wounded. Authorities said Boelter impersonated police officers as he approached their homes and shot his victims, and the manhunt for Boelter lasted over 36 hours, with authorities issuing shelter-in-place orders for parts of the northwest metro. Boelter surrendered to officers, and state officials have vowed to ensure justice is served. Optimism is low due to the tragic loss of life and the politically motivated nature of the crime.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, charged with the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, also visited the homes of other elected officials on the same night, according to the FBI. After shooting the Hoffmans, Boelter went to the homes of a state representative and a state senator, but neither were home. He then proceeded to the Hortmans' residence, where he fatally shot both of them after exchanging gunfire with police officers. Federal investigators allege Boelter stalked his targets, planned his attacks carefully, and conducted surveillance on them for an extensive period of time, and the Hennepin County Attorney intends to pursue first-degree murder charges against Boelter. This article provides more specific details about the shooter's actions prior to the shooting.</p>

          <p>A juror in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial was dismissed due to inconsistent statements about his residency and replaced with an alternate juror. The judge cited concerns about the juror's candor and potential bias in securing a spot on the jury. The trial resumed with testimony from a paralegal detailing messages sent by Combs' personal assistant regarding setting up a "hotel night." Combs has pleaded not guilty and faces a potential life sentence if convicted, and the dismissal of the juror introduces an element of uncertainty into the trial's progression.</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order until June 23, while she considers a longer-term injunction against the proclamation. The Trump administration cited Harvard's engagement with China and other national security concerns when issuing the proclamation on June 4. Harvard argues that the proclamation is an "end run around" a previous court decision and violates the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada, addressing trade tensions and the Israel-Iran conflict. He stated Iran wishes to de-escalate but must make a deal, confirming he has received messages from Iran through intermediaries. A draft G7 statement on Iran is circulating, but Trump is not expected to sign it, and the President also suggested potentially inviting China to join the G7 and discussed Vladimir Putin's exclusion from the group in 2014. Trump's stance on tariffs and past remarks about Canada have created unease among U.S. allies, and the meeting included bilateral discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who emphasized Canada is not for sale.</p>

          <p>A review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales reveals flaws in data collection, making it difficult to assess the true scale of the issue. The report highlights a lack of reliable ethnicity data for perpetrators, describing it as a "major failing," while local police data suggests a disproportionate number of suspects are from Asian ethnic backgrounds. Prime Minister Starmer has accepted the recommendation for a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation, and the report also calls for tightening laws to ensure adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault. The government is bringing forward changes so anyone convicted of sexual offences would have their asylum claim rejected and be denied refugee status.</p>

An Iranian state-run television network was reportedly hit during an Israeli strike, and the Israeli Defense Minister warned that Tehran's residents would "pay the price" for Iranian strikes on Israeli civilians. The fighting has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran, and the U.S. State Department has issued a directive to embassies clarifying that the U.S. is not involved in Israel's actions.</p>

The piece satirizes Trump's perceived ego, fascination with military displays, and longing for a return to a glorified past, and the author contrasts the actual celebration with an imagined, over-the-top spectacle involving tanks, the Pope, and William McKinley.</p>

          <p>The oil and petrochemical lobby is facing criticism for arguing that a New York state proposal to reduce plastic waste would disproportionately harm people of color. Advocates argue that the plastic supply chain poses serious health risks to Black and brown communities, and the proposed legislation aims to reduce plastic packaging and boost recycling rates. Lobbyists have reportedly targeted the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian American legislative caucus, claiming the bill will raise food prices. Critics have labeled these efforts as "plainly racist" and manipulative, while supporters emphasize the bill's potential to reduce toxic emissions in communities of color.</p>

          <p>A former Syrian general, Bassam Hassan, has reportedly told US investigators that American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in 2012, is dead. Hassan claimed that former President Bashar al-Assad ordered Tice's execution, but these claims remain unverified. Tice, a former marine, was abducted in Damascus in August 2012, and conflicting reports have surfaced over the years regarding his fate. The Tice family expressed disappointment with the publication of Hassan's account and doubted its veracity, and the new Syrian president has pledged to assist in the search.</p>
