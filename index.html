          <p>During a campaign event in New Jersey, Rep. Mikie Sherrill suggested the possibility of a third impeachment of President Donald Trump to prevent Republicans from advancing their agenda following the 2026 midterms. Sherrill, who is campaigning to become the next New Jersey governor, emphasized the importance of challenging tough fights and highlighted her previous votes for Trump's impeachments. She also noted the role of Democrat-led states in challenging Trump's policies, citing the need to mobilize and block his efforts at the state level. The congresswoman pointed to federalism as a key tool for states to counter federal actions and protect their election systems.</p>

          <p>Ryan Garcia's year-long hiatus from boxing proved detrimental as he suffered a unanimous decision loss to Rolando Romero in New York City. Garcia, visibly lacking his usual spark, struggled to land significant blows, allowing Romero to control the fight with a well-executed strategy. The article notes that Garcia's performance may have been impacted by his previous suspension for a failed drug test and weight issues in his prior fight against Devin Haney. Romero, who captured the WBA welterweight title, expressed his willingness to face any opponent at 147 pounds, while Garcia acknowledged the impact of his time away from the ring and vowed to return.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges, including inflation and a housing crisis, as well as navigating complex international relations. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party is seeking a second term against opposition leader Peter Dutton, with both acknowledging the difficult environment. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living issues, though both parties have offered only small-scale economic measures. The article notes a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with traditional political offerings, and also that Dutton has echoed some of Trump's rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to moderate the Hong Kong dollar's appreciation against the US dollar. This action comes amid increased capital inflow into the city's stock market and ahead of an expected US Federal Reserve meeting to discuss potential interest rate cuts. The HKMA's intervention involved buying US dollars and selling Hong Kong dollars to stabilize the currency. According to the article, similar interventions are anticipated if the US lowers interest rates, which would likely lead to further capital inflows into Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Saturday's UK newspapers are dominated by two main stories: the performance of Reform UK in the local elections and a BBC interview with Prince Harry regarding his security in the UK. Reform UK's gains, described as a "Reform revolution," sent shockwaves through the political establishment. Meanwhile, Prince Harry's interview revealed strained relationships with the Royal Family, with the Duke of Sussex expressing concerns about his father's health and the limited opportunities for his children to connect with their homeland. The Financial Times Weekend edition stands out by focusing solely on the local elections, highlighting Reform UK's victories as a populist insurgency.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit asserts that these policies, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, obstruct the Trump Administration's efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. The Justice Department argues that Colorado's laws violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by interfering with federal immigration law enforcement. Local officials have responded by defending their policies and vowing to protect their values, while the governor's office maintains that Colorado is not a sanctuary state.</p>

          <p>The United States has implemented a 25% import tax on key car parts, intensifying pressure on the automotive industry amidst ongoing policy shifts. This new tariff, following a similar tax on imported cars, aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, but analysts predict it will likely raise costs for businesses and consumers. While sales have surged due to concerns about price hikes, companies like General Motors are warning of significant cost increases. The article also notes that some exemptions have been granted for parts from Mexico and Canada under the existing free trade agreement.</p>

With President Trump ending the exemption, these companies now face tariffs of up to 145 percent, leading to reduced advertising spending and a shift in business models.

The project has been targeted by the new government's anti-corruption initiative, and funding has been halted.

          <p>A Kyodo News survey indicates that approximately 58 percent of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media during elections should be regulated by law. The survey results come amid growing concerns about partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, particularly in the context of a recent gubernatorial election. While Japan has enacted a law to address defamatory content on social media, its impact has been limited. The survey also explored views on constitutional revision, same-sex marriage, and other social issues.</p>

          <p>Top-ranking officials in the Trump administration have condemned Germany's domestic intelligence agency for designating the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "right-wing extremist" entity. US Vice President JD Vance accused Germany of rebuilding a "Berlin Wall," while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the AfD designation "tyranny in disguise." The German Foreign Ministry responded by defending the decision as a necessary measure to protect the constitution. The AfD, founded in 2013, has gained popularity by capitalizing on fears over migration.</p>

          <p>Water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire, partially because a reservoir was shut down for repairs, and city officials had tried and failed to prepare an alternative reservoir. Records show the city had tried and failed to prepare an alternative reservoir. Emails show that the city had searched for solutions to rectify the monthslong supply shortage but, despite lengthy discussions and preliminary preparations, failed to correct the problem in time. The city ultimately determined that bringing the reservoir back online could have posed a risk to workers and residents of nearby homes because of structural and other safety issues. By the time the fire started in early January, the Pacific Palisades Reservoir remained out of service and the Santa Ynez Reservoir was still two months away from being operable.</p>

PBS President Paula Kerger stated that the funding cuts would disproportionately affect rural communities and impact essential services.

This law aims to bolster the private economy and prevent government intervention in economic disputes. Observers are watching to see how the law will protect the private sector from arbitrary fines and whether it will allow firms to take local governments to court. The 78-article law is hailed by state media as evidence that Beijing is walking the walk after oft-repeated pledges to revitalize the non-state economy.</p>
