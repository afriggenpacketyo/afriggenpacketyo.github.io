          <h2>Fox News Article Explores the Biblical Basis for a Balanced Work Schedule</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 12:03:05 EDT</div>

          <p>This article examines the concept of the seven-day week, tracing its origins to the Bible and arguing for its relevance in modern society. It contrasts the 20th-century view of work as a necessary evil with the current culture of "crazy busyness," advocating for a balance between meaningful work and sacred rest. Drawing on historical research and contemporary studies, the article posits that productivity plateaus after 55 hours of work per week, suggesting that adhering to a six-day work week with a day of rest aligns with both biblical wisdom and optimal productivity. The article also references Joseph from the Bible as a model for finding meaning in work, regardless of the job itself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli air strike in Gaza reportedly killed nine children of a doctor, Alaa al-Najjar, according to the hospital where she works in Khan Younis. One child and her husband were injured but survived. The IDF said its aircraft had struck "a number of suspects" in Khan Younis on Friday, and "the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review". The UN Secretary-General warned that people in Gaza were enduring what may be "the cruellest phase" of the war, and denounced Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March. The hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara is implementing changes to improve community relations and reduce crime. Despite shootings trending down, violent crime remains a challenge, compounded by an officer shortage. O'Hara is focused on restoring trust and changing the department's culture through adjusted arrest tactics, community engagement, and officer training. The Justice Department is ending investigations of six police agencies, including Minneapolis, but O'Hara affirmed that reform efforts will continue.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck the area around Cannes, France, on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes. The outage was caused by a fire at a substation and vandalism of an electricity pylon, leading officials to suspect a criminal act. Despite the disruption, the Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, using an alternative power supply. Power was gradually restored, and the festival continued with minimal interruptions.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a global challenger in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales. Analysts attribute On's success to its innovative shoe aesthetics and strategic timing, capitalizing on Nike's declining sales and Adidas's challenges. While Nike and Adidas hold a significant market share, On's earnings growth has outpaced both companies. However, On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and tariff uncertainties, as 90% of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Catholic Archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, made a rare court appearance during a contentious clergy sexual assault bankruptcy case. Aymond expressed concern for the survivors and a desire to expedite negotiations, acknowledging the prolonged wait for compensation. Attorneys representing abuse claimants criticized the proposed settlement plan, calling it insufficient compared to similar cases. The settlement would provide $130 million in cash and up to $110 million more from insurance carriers and potential church property sales. A vote by all claimants to confirm or reject the settlement is expected this fall.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that America’s next-generation fighter jets and their “loyal wingmen” drones could counter China’s fleet size advantage and extend the operational range for potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific.

Ground testing has begun on the initial CCA designs, with production expected in 2026.

          <p>Dr. Stephanie Venn-Watson, a veterinary epidemiologist, discovered C15:0, a saturated fatty acid, to be a key nutrient for longevity. Venn-Watson and her team discovered a new essential fatty acid, C15:0, which like omega-3′s, can improve health outcomes in mammals. To increase her intake of C15:0, she eats certain foods that are high in this fatty acid. She developed a C15:0 supplement and published a book on her findings. Her discovery marks the "first essential fatty acid to be found in more than ninety years," a finding which earned Venn-Watson a spot on CNBC's 2025 Changemakers List earlier this year.</p>
