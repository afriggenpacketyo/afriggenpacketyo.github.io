            <p>A small, single-engine Cessna 180 plane crashed in Trilla, Illinois, on Saturday morning, killing all four people on board after hitting power lines. The victims, two men and two women from Menomonie, Wisconsin, have not been publicly identified pending family notification. Local residents reported hearing a loud boom and experiencing a brief power outage followed by smoke in the area. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days, and the road where the crash occurred will remain closed until the investigation is complete.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry found that an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month, with the deputy commander of the unit involved being dismissed for providing an incomplete report. The IDF claimed its troops opened fire believing they faced a threat, identifying six of the casualties as Hamas members, though providing no evidence. However, video footage surfaced showing the clearly marked ambulances with lights on, contradicting initial claims of suspicious behavior. The incident occurred in a hostile combat zone with poor visibility, and the IDF confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic following the event.</p>

            <p>Following Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Wolves, manager Ruben Amorim voiced his concerns about the team's inability to score, emphasizing that "if we don't score, nothing matters." He acknowledged the team's struggles, highlighting missed chances by multiple players, not just striker Rasmus Hojlund. Amorim stressed the need for the team to improve their goal-scoring record and vowed to continue working with Hojlund to restore his confidence. United have now lost a club record 15 league games this season and face a critical Europa League campaign.</p>

            <p>Oscar Piastri of McLaren secured his third win of the year at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, taking the lead in the world championship standings. The victory was aided by a five-second penalty issued to Red Bull's Max Verstappen for illegally maintaining his lead by leaving the track. Lando Norris, also from McLaren, finished fourth after recovering from a tenth-place start following a qualifying crash, while Charles Leclerc of Ferrari secured third.

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" level of economic activity followed by a summer slowdown. Businesses are currently stocking up on inventory and consumers are making preemptive purchases in anticipation of the tariffs. This surge in activity could be followed by a decline as people have already bought what they need. Goolsbee remains optimistic about the long-term economic outlook, noting that hard data from April showed steady full employment and decreasing inflation.</p>

            <p>The article discusses President Donald Trump's focus on attracting wealthy immigrants through investment-based residency programs. While many dislike the idea of commodifying national belonging, Trump aligns with free marketeers in seeing the value of such schemes. The current "golden-visa" scheme in the US is considered cumbersome and inefficient, and Trump aims to improve it. The article suggests this approach reflects Trump's love of money and a market-driven perspective on immigration.</p>

Instead, the author suggests focusing on actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital investment, and labor, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies. By monitoring this data directly, one can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's health. (not investment advice)</p>
