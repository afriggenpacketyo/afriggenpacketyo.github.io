          <p>Despite ongoing prisoner exchanges, Russia bombarded cities across Ukraine with drones and missiles, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and over 60 injuries. Ukraine's air force reported that Russia launched 367 "air attack vehicles," including missiles and drones, targeting 22 locations. Ukrainian forces claim to have neutralized 45 cruise missiles and 266 drones during the attack, while Ukraine continues its own drone strikes into Russia. President Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as deliberate attacks on ordinary cities and residential buildings, urging stronger international pressure and sanctions against Russia to halt the ongoing brutality.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The first nationalized service departed on time from Woking to Surbiton, with the government calling the move a "new dawn for rail" focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits. Concerns have been raised by unions over outsourcing staffing for security and cleaning, while the Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on their promises. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that she could not promise lower ticket prices, but assured customers that she would strive to ensure they get good value for money.</p>

In response, Russia's defense ministry claimed to have destroyed 110 Ukrainian drones over 12 Russian regions and Crimea.

          <p>A 1990 trading card featuring Erik and Lyle Menendez, infamous for the murder of their parents, has surged in value due to their presence in the background of the card. The card, originally valued at cents, has seen listings reach hundreds of dollars, though eBay has removed listings explicitly referencing the Menendez brothers. Some collectors are reportedly sending the card to the brothers in prison for autographs. The Menendez brothers, who admitted to the 1989 shotgun massacre of their parents, are now eligible for parole and are set to appear before the parole board on June 13, 2025.</p>

          <p>The European Union is engaged in a trade dispute with China over electric vehicles, leading to a debate on whether to embrace Chinese investment in the sector.

          <p>Sir Alan Bates, a former subpostmaster and campaigner for victims of the Post Office scandal, claims the government's compensation offer amounts to less than half of his claim. He accuses ministers of presiding over "quasi-kangaroo courts" and altering the "goal posts" on their judgements. Bates also calls for an independent body to deliver compensation schemes for this and similar public sector scandals. The government maintains that it aims to give the benefit of the doubt to postmasters and that anyone unhappy with their offer can have their case reviewed by a panel of experts.</p>

The public is advised to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide. This summer, Gamston in Retford will undergo mosquito surveillance as part of a national project to understand mosquito activity across Britain.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a bank manager, and her daughter Breea were kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank after being threatened with dynamite. The gunmen, led by Christopher Butler, held them hostage overnight and forced Michelle to steal $360,000 from the bank. Despite providing crucial details that led to the arrest of Butler and his accomplices, Michelle was falsely painted as a criminal during the trial. Lisa Ramirez, Butler's fiancee, falsely claimed that Michelle was in on the plot, leading to a grueling trial where Michelle's past was scrutinized and her credibility attacked. Eventually, Butler recanted his story, but the ordeal left lasting scars on Michelle and Breea.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee and her daughter Breea were kidnapped and held hostage, with Michelle forced to rob a bank to save their lives. The kidnappers, led by Christopher Butler, strapped fake dynamite to Michelle and threatened to detonate it if she didn't comply. Michelle robbed the bank of $360,000, but the subsequent trial saw her credibility attacked and falsely accused of being complicit in the crime. Despite the overwhelming evidence against Butler and his accomplices, the defense's tactics led to a hung jury on the kidnapping charges against Michelle, though the truth eventually came out when Butler recanted his story years later.</p>

Drawing on a past experience with miscarriage, she recalls how horror movies provided a similar sense of perspective and relief. While recognizing the disturbing nature of the content, she finds comfort in the alternate reality, even as the season finale approaches.</p>
