            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen visited Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, and found him 'traumatized' after being held in the notorious Cecot prison. Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a different facility in Santa Ana, where conditions are reportedly better, though he remains isolated from news and communication. Van Hollen accused the Trump administration of violating due process by deporting Abrego Garcia, who has no criminal convictions, based on unsubstantiated gang affiliation claims. Despite court orders to facilitate his return, the White House maintains Abrego Garcia will not be allowed back into the US.</p>

            <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported from the US to El Salvador, has sparked a legal and political battle, with the Trump administration claiming he is a member of MS-13, a claim he denies. While judges have ordered the US government to facilitate his return, the White House insists he will never live in the US again. Police reports cite his clothing and a confidential source as evidence of gang affiliation, but his lawyers argue he has never been convicted of any crime and was granted a 'withholding of removal' order due to fear of persecution by a rival gang.</p>

The appeals court's order does not rule on the merits of the inquiry but allows the petitioners to file a reply.

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was 'traumatized' during his imprisonment. Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia, described the conditions in the CECOT prison and the challenges he faced in coordinating the meeting. The Trump administration continues to assert that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, allegations denied by his attorney and family. The senator emphasized the importance of due process and criticized the administration's handling of the case, while Republicans have criticized Van Hollen's trip.</p>

            <p>A prolonged bin strike in Birmingham has highlighted the inequality between wealthier and poorer areas, with waste piling up in densely populated, inner-city neighborhoods while affluent areas remain relatively unaffected. The strike, triggered by planned pay cuts for some workers, has resulted in 22,000 tonnes of uncollected waste, leading to increased rat infestations and public health concerns. Residents express frustration and anger, claiming a two-tier waste collection system is in place, while officials pledge to improve fairness once the strike ends.</p>

            <p>The ACLU is warning that the Trump administration is moving to deport hundreds of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, despite a Supreme Court ruling requiring due process. Migrants at a Texas detention facility were allegedly informed of their imminent deportation without adequate notice or opportunity to challenge their removal. The ACLU has filed an emergency injunction with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully sought to halt deportations in federal court, arguing that the government is not complying with the Supreme Court's order.</p>
