McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has diversified its imports to reduce reliance on any single country outside the U.S. Home Depot reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, missing earnings expectations but exceeding sales estimates, with executives attributing dampened home improvement spending to high interest rates and economic uncertainty.

Reverse mortgages, on the other hand, allow seniors to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited financial resources who want to age in place, but they come with higher costs and erode home equity over time.

A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggests that this could cause a "spillover effect," increasing the risk of borrowers falling behind on other debt repayments. The end of the Covid-era payment pause and subsequent on-ramp period has resulted in a spike in student loan delinquency rates, with nearly 8% of total student debt reported as 90 days past due in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>Ryanair has instructed some flight attendants in Spain to repay salary increases of up to â‚¬3,000 following a legal dispute with the Union Sindical Obrera. The pay rise was initially agreed with another union, CCOO, but the court nullified the deal after the Union Sindical Obrera won a case. While CCOO members will not be required to repay the increase, Union Sindical Obrera members and non-members have had their salary reverted to the pre-agreement level. The airline plans to deduct the owed money from the flight attendants' payslips.</p>

          <p>A new deal between the UK and the EU addresses several key issues, including professional qualifications, passport queues, pet passports, and trade for British farmers. While the deal promises "dedicated dialogues" on the recognition of professional qualifications, a full agreement may take time to negotiate. The agreement provides clarity on the use of e-gates for UK citizens, but these changes will not be implemented in time for the summer. It also commits to introducing a new passport system for pets and requires the UK to align with EU food standards in exchange for removing veterinary checks.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved a new package of sanctions on Russia, targeting covert oil exports, while also planning tougher restrictions. This move aims to intensify economic pressure on Russia and encourage peace talks, but questions remain about the effectiveness of sanctions and the future U.S. approach. The new sanctions target Russia's shadow fleet of old tankers, adding to existing measures that target individuals, companies, and key products. Despite these efforts, Russia's economy has rebounded, partly due to heavy military spending and new markets.</p>

CATL's exclusion of American investors in Hong Kongâ€™s splashiest stock sale of the year was a reversal from a decade ago when Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, elicited cheers from traders as it went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. This exclusion highlights the increasing financial decoupling between the two countries and the growing trend of limiting U.S. access to Chinese markets over national security concerns.</p>
