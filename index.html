          <p>National Public Radio (NPR) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump over his executive order to cease all federal funding for the non-profit broadcaster. The lawsuit, joined by three other public radio stations, argues that Trump's order violates the First Amendment's protections for speech and the press, and infringes upon Congress' authority. NPR's president, Katherine Maher, stated that the order is retaliatory and viewpoint-based discrimination. The lawsuit aims to protect the public radio system, which millions of Americans rely on for news and information. The article reflects a serious legal challenge with uncertain outcomes.</p>

          <p>Businesses are utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of U.S. customs law, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, often reducing the duty imposed. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, carried out at arm's length by independent parties, with proof that the item was destined for the U.S. Italian luxury fashion brand Moncler has cited the first sale rule as providing significant benefit to its cost structure.

          <p>A shift toward nuclear power is gaining momentum in Europe as countries seek greater energy independence. Denmark is reconsidering its 40-year ban on nuclear power, Spain is reportedly open to reviewing the shutdown of its nuclear plants, and Germany has dropped its opposition to atomic power. This renewed interest is driven by the costs associated with renewables and the desire for more reliable energy sources.

However, a spokesperson for Biden confirmed that his last known prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test was conducted in 2014.

          <p>Despite flagging U.S. support, Ukrainian forces continue to hold off Russian advances through innovation and the use of domestically produced drones. These drones guide artillery, deliver payloads, resupply units, and map out minefields. Ukrainian soldiers have adapted to the battlefield by using foxholes instead of visible trenches, and they are using electronic-warfare systems to jam drone signals. The Ukrainian military has also developed a battlefield-management system called Delta, which integrates information from various sources to improve decision-making.
