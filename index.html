          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion semiconductor supply deal with Samsung Electronics, which will extend until the end of 2033. The partnership is centered on producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips at Samsung's new manufacturing facility in Texas, an initiative Musk described as having immense strategic importance. He also suggested the deal's ultimate value could surpass the announced figure and stressed his personal commitment to maximizing the plant's manufacturing efficiency. This collaboration underscores the critical role of advanced chip technology in powering future developments in artificial intelligence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have established a framework deal to de-escalate their trade dispute, setting a new 15% US tariff on many EU goods. While the Trump administration hails this as a major victory, the EU avoided a threatened 30% rate, though it is still a significant increase from previous levels. The agreement also includes EU commitments to purchase billions in US energy and arms, and to increase investment in the US by $600 billion. Despite providing some stability, the deal leaves tariffs on steel and aluminum at 50% and raises concerns about the future of international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Nurses Union Poised to Reject Pay Offer, Raising Possibility of Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 02:54:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay award in a consultative vote, signaling the potential for strike action later this year. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque," noting it is lower than increases given to other public sector workers like doctors and teachers. The RCN is demanding that ministers enter negotiations over the summer to avert a formal strike ballot in the autumn. This development follows a similar rejection by the GMB union, which represents other health workers, increasing pressure on the government amid ongoing pay disputes.</p>

          <p>English golfer Charley Hull is aiming to win her first major championship at the AIG Women's Open, two decades after first gaining national attention as a child prodigy. Now 29, Hull enters the tournament at Royal Porthcawl following a disrupted preparation due to a recent virus that caused her to collapse during a previous event. Known for her unconventional approach and powerful personality, she has recorded three runner-up finishes in majors but has yet to secure a victory. Despite recent health setbacks, Hull hopes her past success at the Porthcawl course as a junior will provide a positive foundation for her challenge.</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Europe, President Donald Trump reiterated his strong opposition to wind power, making several factually inaccurate claims about the energy source. He asserted that wind turbines are "killing" Americans, destroying scenery, and are an expensive, unreliable form of energy primarily made in China. Trump's long-standing animosity towards wind power is believed to stem from a proposed offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf resort two decades ago. His latest comments have drawn criticism and fact-checks, highlighting his continued use of public platforms to voice personal grievances against renewable energy.</p>

This shift reflects increasing anxiety about the domestic job market and a focus on immediate employability rather than long-term academic prestige. The trend has been amplified by the rise of artificial intelligence, which has intensified demand for technology-related fields and led some students to choose lower-ranked schools to secure a spot in these popular programs.

German industry groups have expressed disappointment, noting that even a 15% tariff rate on cars will have immense negative effects on the country's export-driven economy.

The piece contends that political leaders are playing a game of maintaining Israel's tenability while a humanitarian catastrophe unfolds.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides trusted, evidence-based guidelines for primary care, influencing everything from cancer screenings to diabetes management. This potential move follows Kennedy's recent dismissal of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, raising fears that the USPSTF could be replaced with less qualified or politically motivated members. Critics warn that dismantling the panel would undermine trust in medical guidance and disrupt preventive care for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>Michigan authorities are seeking to file terrorism and assault charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect allegedly used a folding knife to attack five men and six women before being confronted by armed citizens in the parking lot and taken into custody by a deputy. All victims were transported to a local hospital and are expected to survive, with their conditions improving. The motive for the attack is still under investigation by local law enforcement with assistance from the FBI.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has lauded a new tariff agreement with the European Union as a "powerful deal" that successfully averts a potentially damaging transatlantic trade war. The announcement came after a meeting in Scotland with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, where Trump highlighted the EU's commitment to purchase tens of billions more in US energy products. In separate news from Washington, House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed significant hesitation about the prospect of pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell. The statement came as another Republican suggested a pardon could be considered to gain more information about Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.</p>
