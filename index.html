          <p>House Republicans have advanced a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," that could significantly impact household finances. The bill aims to make President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase the SALT deduction limit to $40,000, and boost the child tax credit to $2,500. To offset these tax cuts, the bill proposes substantial cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially affecting millions of individuals' access to healthcare and food assistance. It also introduces new "Trump Accounts" for child savings and a tax deduction for interest on auto loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

While some current and former federal health officials have criticized the report for misrepresenting facts and omitting other known drivers, the report suggests a shift towards preventative measures and addressing corporate influence in federal policymaking.

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant downturn after House Republicans passed a tax bill terminating key clean energy credits. Companies like Sunrun, Enphase, and SolarEdge saw substantial drops in their stock prices, with Sunrun plummeting 37%. The bill eliminates tax credits for installers leasing equipment and investment/electricity production credits for clean energy facilities. Analysts describe the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, potentially impacting the expansion of utility-scale solar projects. First Solar, a major U.S. panel producer, was less affected due to the manufacturing tax credit remaining relatively intact.</p>

The blockade had exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the territory, causing severe shortages of essential resources. The aid is being delivered to warehouses and other distribution sites within Gaza, providing some relief to the affected population.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining currently enrolled foreign students, citing an unsafe campus environment. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Harvard's leadership permitted anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including Jewish students. Harvard has called the revocation unlawful and is working to support its international students. A federal judge issued an injunction against the Trump administration, potentially blocking the action against international students.</p>

Trump also claimed a "white genocide" was occurring, but statistics do not support this assertion. Trump played footage of officials singing "Kill the Boer," but the individuals were opposition politicians, not government officials.</p>
