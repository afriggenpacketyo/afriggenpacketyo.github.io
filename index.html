          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. This move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health effects of corn syrup. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and hinted at upcoming product innovations. The company currently uses cane sugar in many international markets, including Mexico and the United Kingdom.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:02:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are expressing significant concern over the potential economic fallout if President Trump were to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A Wolfe Research note described the scenario as a "mess" that could trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. Despite Trump publicly stating such a move is "highly unlikely," his history of criticizing Powell and his mercurial nature keep markets on edge. The legality of such a firing would likely be challenged in court, creating further instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coinbase has launched a new "everything app" called Base App, aiming to integrate crypto-based payments, social media, and other services into a single platform for consumers. The app, which replaces Coinbase Wallet, is built on the company's Base blockchain and seeks to attract users not primarily interested in speculative trading. By bundling various functions and leveraging its low-cost, high-speed network, Coinbase hopes to create a new economic model for content creators and expand crypto's utility in everyday life, reducing its reliance on trading revenue.

          <p>A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning for the state's southern peninsula. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory, with officials stating that while some coastal impact is expected, large, widespread waves are unlikely. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, prompted evacuations in some communities as a precautionary measure. The region is located along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," which has a history of major seismic events.</p>

Since the tariffs were announced, economists have consistently warned that U.S. consumers would ultimately bear the cost, as tariffs are effectively a tax on imported goods. The report notes that despite fluctuating rates and partial pauses, tariffs have remained high on nearly all U.S. imports for over three months. The central question explored is not if, but when, the financial burden of these trade policies will be felt by the American public.</p>

Using NASA's Webb Telescope and other observatories, scientists identified the formation of silicate minerals, the building blocks of planets, in the disc of gas and dust surrounding the protostar. This discovery provides a direct glimpse into the earliest stages of planet formation, offering a real-world example of what our own solar system may have looked like in its infancy. The findings will help scientists better understand planetary origins.</p>

          <h2>Texas Death Row Inmate Robert Roberson Scheduled for October Execution</h2>

          <p>A Texas judge has scheduled an October 16 execution date for death row inmate Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter in 2002. The case is highly controversial, as the conviction was based on a "shaken baby syndrome" diagnosis that many medical and legal experts now consider scientifically unreliable. Roberson's attorneys argue that new evidence proves his innocence and that the child's death was a tragic accident, not a crime. The case has drawn bipartisan support for a new trial, but appeals are still pending.</p>

          <p>More than 20 children, most of them toddlers, have been placed in the custody of a California child-welfare agency as authorities investigate a Los Angeles-area couple. The investigation began after an infant in the couple's care was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly inflicted by a nanny. Authorities discovered the couple are the legal parents of all the children, who were born via numerous surrogate mothers around the country. Some surrogates have come forward stating they were misled and unaware so many other children were involved.</p>

          <p>As the bankrupt Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans finalizes a settlement for 633 clergy abuse claims, about half of them could be thrown out. The church's investors argue in court that many claims were filed late, were duplicates, or involved abusers not under the archdiocese's authority. If these claims are disqualified, it would increase the average payout for the remaining victims but could also empower opponents of the settlement to reject the deal.

          <p>An ABC News report provides a timeline of President Trump's evolving public statements about Jeffrey Epstein, from his first term through the current controversy. In 2019, Trump distanced himself, claiming he "wasn't a fan," while also suggesting Epstein may have been killed. During his 2024 campaign, he pledged to declassify the Epstein files. Now in office, he has abruptly reversed course, calling the matter a "Democratic hoax" and admonishing his own supporters for their fixation on it, creating a significant political backlash from his base and fueling further speculation.</p>

          <p>Financial expert Humphrey Yang suggests that many people may be able to retire much earlier than they think and outlines several key indicators. Among the most important signs are having paid off one's mortgage, which is typically the largest monthly expense for most families. Other factors include understanding the difference between a savings rate and a total nest egg, and having established multiple, diversified streams of income beyond a primary job. These elements create a strong financial position that can make stepping away from traditional employment a viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

Eight babies, born through this method at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, are reported to be healthy and free of the devastating conditions that affected their families. The process combines the nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a female donor, creating an embryo with genetic material from three people. This breakthrough offers hope to families plagued by these often-fatal hereditary disorders.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that China is making significant progress in controlling the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This positive assessment marks a shift from his previous rhetoric, where he has used the fentanyl issue to justify imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations between the two countries are ongoing. In February, Trump had explicitly linked the continuation of tariffs to China's efforts to stop the drug's supply, but he now appears to be acknowledging cooperation from Beijing on the matter.</p>
