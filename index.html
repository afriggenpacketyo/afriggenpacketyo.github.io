            <p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Department of Justice to provide daily updates on the efforts to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.

The Supreme Court upheld the judge's order to facilitate his return, despite DOJ claims that foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines.

            <p>A glitch in U.S. Customs and Border Protection's system is delaying the collection of tariffs on freight shipments, including those from China and nations under the 90-day tariff pause. The error affects the entry code used to exempt freight from tariffs, causing confusion and uncertainty for U.S. shippers. While Customs advises importers to file cargo release forms separately, the glitch raises concerns about the agency's ability to manage the new tariff policies and collect revenue effectively. The situation adds to existing anxieties among businesses already struggling with tariff policy changes.</p>

            <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's tariffs may be part of a broader strategy to reshape the global economic order. The administration, influenced by economic advisor Stephen Miran, may be seeking to renegotiate the terms of international trade, potentially including the role of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency. Miran has proposed a "Mar-A-Lago Accord" to address perceived burdens on the U.S. economy due to the dollar's special status. However, some economists argue that the benefits of the dollar's reserve currency status outweigh the costs.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The justices upheld a lower court's order to "facilitate" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, while also acknowledging that the judge may have exceeded her authority. Abrego Garcia was deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador under an agreement between the two countries. The judge ordered the Trump administration to provide daily updates on their efforts to bring him back to the U.S.</p>

Restaurant owners are struggling with increased costs, potentially threatening the diversity of the city's culinary landscape.

The tariffs are part of President Trump's America First trade policy, but some question what "American food" means in a city known for its immigrant communities and diverse cuisines.</p>

This strategy aligns with Xi's long-term goal of reducing reliance on the United States. Experts suggest that Xi believes China can weather the damage and that the U.S. will ultimately be the one to concede. China also has other retaliatory measures it can employ, such as restricting exports of rare earth minerals.</p>
