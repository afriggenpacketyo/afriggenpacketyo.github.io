          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Glasnow Leaves Game Early with Shoulder Issue</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tyler Glasnow, a pitcher for the Dodgers, exited Sunday's game against the Pirates in the second inning due to right-shoulder discomfort, raising concerns given his history of injuries, including Tommy John surgery in 2021 and a recent elbow sprain. After giving up two home runs in the first, Glasnow signaled discomfort during his warmup pitches in the second inning, leading to his immediate removal from the game. The Dodgers' pitching staff is already dealing with Blake Snell's shoulder inflammation, making Glasnow's injury a significant setback for the team's rotation as he has had a 3.78 ERA through five starts. The severity of the injury is still unknown at this time.</p>

          <p>The musical “Dead Outlaw,” based on the true story of Elmer McCurdy, a failed bandit who gained more notoriety in death, premiered on Broadway. McCurdy, born in 1880, died in 1911 after a shootout with police, and his preserved body was displayed at carnivals and freak shows before being discovered in a Long Beach fun house. The musical explores the oddity of McCurdy's life and afterlife, examining American moneymaking ethos through the lens of a historical curiosity. While the show is stylistically exhilarating, some critics find the character of Elmer flat and the critique of the American dream less impactful.</p>

The goal is to identify patterns and potential meanings in dolphin vocalizations, ultimately creating a shared vocabulary for interactive communication. DolphinGemma utilizes audio recording technology from Pixel phones to isolate dolphin sounds from background noise, and Google plans to release it as an open model this summer for researchers worldwide to use and adapt. This technology could help study various dolphin species and deepen our understanding of these marine mammals.</p>
