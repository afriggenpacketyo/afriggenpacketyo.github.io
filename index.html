          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 14:14:24 EDT</div>

          <p>Former President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a significant trade agreement, successfully preventing a threatened 30% tariff on EU goods. The new deal establishes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., while the EU will accept American imports without tariffs. As part of the agreement, the European Union has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing $600 billion in the United States. The deal, announced from Scotland, excludes steel, aluminum, and pharmaceuticals but marks a major de-escalation in transatlantic trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought indicated that the Trump administration is considering further spending cuts through rescission packages, not ruling out action before September's government funding deadline. In an interview, Vought defended the executive branch's authority to withhold congressionally-appropriated funds to eliminate perceived waste, specifically mentioning reviews of funding for the NIH and the Department of Education. His comments, including a desire for a "less bipartisan" appropriations process, have fueled concerns among Democrats and some Republicans about a potential government shutdown and a constitutional clash over the power of the purse.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University President Ted Carter stated he is not feeling significant pressure from a Trump administration investigation into the university's diversity policies and alleged antisemitic practices. Carter noted that despite being on a list of schools under probe, research funding has remained strong and that the university is focused on affordability and workforce development. He also addressed a new state law requiring professors to post syllabi online, acknowledging faculty concerns but affirming the university's commitment to both academic freedom and legal compliance. Carter emphasized that large public universities are crucial to restoring public confidence in higher education.</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" has ignited questions about the viability of the traditional late-night television format in the modern media landscape. While some view the cancellation as a purely financial move by parent company Paramount amid industry-wide advertising revenue declines, others see it as a sign of a broader trend. The article notes that late-night shows are expensive to produce and face dwindling linear TV audiences. The future of the format may become clearer with Disney's upcoming decision on Jimmy Kimmel's contract, as networks weigh the costs against promotional value and digital reach.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's move to weaken anti-corruption agencies reflects a broader global trend enabled by a shift in U.S. foreign policy. The article argues that the Trump administration has systematically dismantled programs promoting good governance and has tolerated corruption among allies, sending a signal that pressure for reform is off. This new paradigm, which contrasts with previous U.S. efforts to tie aid to anti-corruption measures, has allegedly created an environment where leaders worldwide feel less constrained to act in their own political interests, even at the expense of democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would have "great pause" before supporting a pardon or sentence commutation for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. Johnson called her crimes "unforgivable" and suggested her sentence was a "pittance," though he deferred the ultimate decision to the president. His comments highlight a split within the Republican party, as Representative Thomas Massie suggested a pardon could be considered to compel her testimony about Jeffrey Epstein's network. The discussion follows a recent meeting between a top DOJ official and Maxwell in prison.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri claimed victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, extending his championship lead after a decisive overtake on his teammate, Lando Norris. The race began under wet conditions after a significant delay due to heavy rain. Piastri made his move on the first racing lap and skillfully managed his tires to control the race from the front. Norris finished second after his team opted for a divergent tire strategy that did not pay off. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc secured the final podium position, finishing third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party will seek to ban all NHS doctors from taking strike action if they win the next election. The proposal would introduce legislation for minimum service levels, placing doctors under the same restrictions as police and military personnel. The announcement comes as thousands of resident doctors began a five-day strike over a long-running pay dispute. The British Medical Association (BMA) called the proposal a "desperate intervention" and defended industrial action as a last resort, emphasizing that the right to strike should always be protected.</p>

          <p>A new direct passenger flight route between Moscow and Pyongyang has been launched, marking another sign of deepening ties between Russia and North Korea. The first flight, operated by a private Russian carrier, was scheduled to depart on Sunday, representing the first such direct connection since the mid-1990s. This development follows the recent reopening of a direct train link and comes as the two nations have increased diplomatic, economic, and military cooperation.

          <p>During a private visit to Scotland, former President Trump was met by protestors while playing golf at his Turnberry resort. Dozens of demonstrators gathered to express their disapproval, holding signs and conveying that he was not welcome in the country.

While security kept the protestors at a distance from the golf course itself, hundreds more gathered for a separate demonstration in Edinburgh, criticizing both Trump and the current British prime minister.</p>

          <p>A growing cybersecurity threat known as "quishing" is exploiting the widespread use of QR codes to defraud consumers. Scammers are placing fake QR code stickers on everything from parking meters to utility bills, tricking people into visiting malicious websites that steal personal and financial information or download malware. The Federal Trade Commission and other agencies have issued warnings about this scam, which relies on the public's trust and the urgency of a situation to succeed. Experts note that these scams are increasing as traditional email phishing becomes less effective due to improved security filters.</p>

          <p>Preparations are moving forward to refit a Boeing 747-8 jet, donated by the Qatari royal family, for use as Air Force One. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly seen schematics for the plane, which was confirmed as a gift to the U.S. earlier this year. The donation has raised questions regarding constitutional rules against a president accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. The jumbo jet, valued at $400 million, will require extensive and costly renovations to meet the security and communication standards of the presidential aircraft before it can enter service.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a BBC analysis, Israel's recent announcement of new aid measures for Gaza, including a "tactical pause" in fighting, is likely a gesture aimed at appeasing allied nations that have strongly condemned the humanitarian crisis. While Israel denies responsibility for the starvation, its closest allies in Europe have blamed it for restricting aid. The new measures, which include airdrops and designated corridors, are seen by critics and aid agencies as insufficient. Experts argue that only a full ceasefire and an unrestricted, long-term aid operation can truly address the catastrophic level of hunger in the territory.</p>
