          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, newly formed ones generate a unique form of "music" as they settle into a stable shape. This phenomenon occurs when a new black hole, created from a star's collapse or object fusion, rapidly stabilizes, causing distortions in space-time that ring out like a pure sound. These gravitational waves are not literal music but can be translated into audible frequencies for human experience. Scientists anticipate that we will soon have the capability to listen to these cosmic vibrations, offering a new way to study these celestial objects.</p>

          <p>Supermodel Heidi Klum recently shared a photo on Instagram from a bikini photoshoot in St. Barth where she experienced a minor wardrobe malfunction. While posing in the ocean with seashells covering her chest, she humorously captioned the image "Woopsy," using a star emoji to maintain her modesty. The article also touches on her personal life, including her recent sixth wedding anniversary with husband Tom Kaulitz. Klum has previously addressed public criticism regarding the 17-year age gap in her marriage, attributing the negativity to spitefulness and age-shaming.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. This initiative is expected to have a more significant impact in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger portion of household income. For example, the payment accounts for over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poorer province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. Experts believe this could stimulate consumption and potentially increase birth rates more effectively in smaller cities and rural areas.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales in China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market following previous U.S. export restrictions. The agreement signals a potential easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, as both sides have recently made concessions on trade controls. This move comes as the U.S. continues to push for greater domestic investment in the technology and AI sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Son is steering SoftBank to invest heavily in the entire AI ecosystem, from chip designers like Arm and Ampere to foundational models like OpenAI. This strategy follows a period of significant losses for SoftBank's Vision Fund, which had previously made large, sometimes unsuccessful, bets on companies like WeWork. Despite past stumbles, Son's conviction is that AI represents a fundamental technological shift, and he is determined to position SoftBank at its center. (not investment advice)</p>

The journalists were in a designated press tent when the attack occurred, which the broadcaster condemned as a "targeted assassination." The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed striking one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim previously denied by al-Sharif and press freedom groups. This incident adds to the high number of journalists killed since the conflict began, raising further concerns about press safety in the region.</p>

          <p>The 911 emergency system in Redondo Beach, California, was temporarily knocked offline on Sunday due to a fire at an AT&T communications facility. The incident began as a trash fire that spread to the nearby building in Gardena, which housed lead-acid batteries, turning the blaze toxic. Over 100 firefighters, including a Hazmat team, responded to the fire, and local residents were asked to shelter in place. The 911 service experienced intermittent disruptions for about an hour but was restored without any reported injuries from the incident.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to achieve the "complete the defeat of Hamas." Speaking to foreign media, he asserted that Israel's goal is to demilitarize the enclave and install a non-Israeli civilian administration, not to occupy it. The plan, which has drawn international condemnation, involves moving Palestinian civilians to designated safe zones. Netanyahu's defense came ahead of a UN Security Council emergency meeting and amid reports of heavy Israeli bombardment in Gaza City that killed several journalists.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas have experienced their warmest start to the year on record, leading to significant changes in marine ecosystems. This warming trend, driven by climate change, has attracted species not typically found in the area, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. While these new arrivals are remarkable, the rising temperatures are also stressing native cold-water species like cod, pushing them further north. Scientists view these rapid changes as a clear indicator of an ecosystem under pressure from the effects of global warming.</p>

Researchers found that damaging the nasal tissue can allow certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, to travel more easily to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In response, the mouse brains deposited amyloid-beta protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's. While the findings are preliminary and have not been replicated in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding the environmental factors that could contribute to the onset of the neurodegenerative condition.</p>

          <p>A weekend of protests in London related to the Israel-Gaza conflict resulted in a high number of arrests. On Saturday, police arrested 532 people, mostly for showing support for Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned as a terrorist organization. The following day, several hundred people marched to demand the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, protesting the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. The demonstrations highlight the deep divisions and high tensions surrounding the conflict, with relatives of hostages participating in the Sunday march to pressure the government.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck the western Turkish province of Balikesir on Sunday, resulting in one death and 29 injuries. The tremor, centered in the town of Sindirgi, caused over a dozen buildings to collapse and was felt as far away as Istanbul. Turkey's Interior Minister confirmed that an 81-year-old person died after being pulled from rubble. Search and rescue operations have since concluded. Earthquakes are a common occurrence in Turkey, which is situated on major fault lines and experienced a devastating quake in 2023 that killed over 53,000 people.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are criticizing a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas, with some labeling the move as "cheating." The political feud has intensified as Texas Democrats left the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the new maps, which could significantly favor the GOP in upcoming elections. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return and to call indefinite special legislative sessions. Prominent Democrats have defended their colleagues' actions, framing it as a necessary fight against an undemocratic power grab.</p>

Video captured the boat being tossed by the waves, appearing to nearly capsize before coming to rest. No injuries were reported, and the boat's fuel and batteries were removed to prevent pollution while the owner arranged for its removal.</p>

          <p>Vice President J.D. Vance has stated that President Donald Trump is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a response to Beijing's continued purchases of Russian oil. While Vance noted that no firm decision has been made, the move is being weighed as part of the administration's ongoing efforts to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington responded that its trade with Russia is normal cooperation conducted within the framework of international law. The potential tariffs could further complicate the already complex U.S.-China trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

Led by figures like Meir Simcha, settlers are expanding outposts on hilltops, which they see as implementing God's will to claim the land for Jews. Human rights groups and UN experts have documented a systemic pattern of intimidation, violence, and land dispossession, often with the alleged complicity of Israeli security forces.

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, posits that World War II was a pivotal and often underestimated factor in shaping the nation's trajectory. The conflict devastated the infrastructure built in the preceding decades, forcing China to essentially restart its development after the war. In an analysis of the war's 80-year legacy, Mitter suggests that despite its tumultuous history, China's contemporary strategic and economic interests are best served by maintaining peace and stability throughout the Asia-Pacific region. This perspective offers a historical context for understanding China's current geopolitical posture.</p>

This demand comes amid threats to place the city under federal control and an increase in the presence of federal law enforcement to address what he calls out-of-control crime. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, noting that violent crime rates have actually been decreasing. Advocacy groups have criticized the president's approach to homelessness, which includes policies that make it easier to arrest individuals for urban camping.</p>
