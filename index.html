          <p>Amazon's stock fell by 8% despite reporting second-quarter results that largely surpassed Wall Street expectations. Investors were concerned by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and slower growth in its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, compared to rivals like Microsoft and Google. The company also announced an increase in capital expenditures, primarily for artificial intelligence infrastructure, leaving investors to question when these significant investments will translate into profit. The report noted that Amazon has so far managed the impact of U.S.-China tariffs better than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

This escalation follows a war of words where Trump issued a deadline for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, and Medvedev warned that such ultimatums were a step towards war. Trump emphasized the importance of words and their potential for unintended consequences, expressing hope this would not be such an instance.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a key funder for NPR and PBS, announced it will wind down its operations after the Trump administration and Congress eliminated its federal funding. The organization, which provides grants to 1,500 local public stations, will cut most of its staff by the end of September 2025. CPB President Patricia Harrison stated the closure is a "difficult reality" despite efforts from millions of Americans to preserve its funding. The move has raised concerns about the future of public media, particularly in rural areas.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has largely sided with finance companies in test cases concerning hidden commissions on car loans, narrowing the path for millions of motorists to claim compensation. The court's decision reverses earlier rulings that could have led to widespread payouts for discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), which were banned in 2021. While some drivers who had DCAs before the ban may still be eligible for compensation through a potential Financial Conduct Authority scheme, the scope will be much smaller than anticipated. Lenders had set aside billions for potential payouts, but the ruling significantly reduces their financial exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex-trafficking crimes related to Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved from a low-security prison in Florida to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas. The transfer occurred shortly after she was interviewed for two days by Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche about the Epstein case. This move comes amid political pressure for more transparency regarding the Epstein investigation.

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 500 points, as investors reacted to multiple negative economic signals. A weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which showed the addition of only 73,000 jobs, coupled with downward revisions for previous months, indicated a hiring slowdown. The market's anxiety was compounded by the White House's announcement of new, high tariffs on over 60 countries, raising concerns about their impact on global trade and economic growth. These factors have increased investor expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

The move escalates a social media confrontation that began with Trump's ultimatum to Russia regarding the war in Ukraine. This geopolitical maneuvering occurs as Russia intensifies its attacks on Kyiv, where a day of mourning was held for 31 victims of a recent missile strike. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reiterated his willingness to engage in direct peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed steep new tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioned a Brazilian Supreme Court Justice, Alexandre de Moraes, prompting condemnation from Brazil's President Lula da Silva. The U.S. justified the measures by citing the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, which it called a "witch hunt," and Brazil's closer ties with China. While some Brazilian products were exempted, the average tariff is now around 30%.

According to the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a state requires a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity for international relations. However, political recognition, particularly for UN membership, is crucial and often a barrier, as it requires approval from the UN Security Council's permanent members. While Palestine is recognized by nearly 150 nations and holds observer status at the UN, it lacks full membership, which limits certain international protections.</p>

Analysts suggest that in periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, investors tend to pull capital from speculative assets like crypto, leading to a strategic cooldown after a strong performance in July.

          <p>U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is offering signing bonuses up to $50,000 and student loan assistance to attract new recruits, particularly for deportation officer roles. The agency aims to hire 10,000 new personnel to support the Trump administration's goal of increasing deportations to one million per year. The recruitment drive is funded by a significant budget increase for the Department of Homeland Security. A former ICE official expressed concern that the rapid hiring push could lead to a decline in standards for new officers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, once seen as unbeatable, now appear vulnerable, and their rivals, particularly the San Diego Padres, have taken notice. The Padres made several bold moves at the trade deadline, acquiring high-impact players like pitcher Mason Miller and others to bolster their roster for a playoff push. This aggressive strategy, which involved trading top prospects, contrasts with the Dodgers' more cautious approach. The article suggests the National League is now a wide-open field, with the Padres positioned to challenge the Dodgers for the division title.</p>

          <p>Tributes are being paid to Ameiya and Ricardo Junior Parris, siblings aged 13 and 11 from Birmingham, who drowned off a beach in Salou, Spain. The children were on holiday with their parents when they encountered strong currents while swimming.

          <p>At a National Transportation Safety Board hearing, experts testified that the night-vision goggles worn by the U.S. Army helicopter pilots involved in a fatal January crash over Washington D.C. may have hindered their ability to see the passenger jet they collided with. The goggles limit peripheral vision and can make it difficult to discern an aircraft's colored lights, which indicate its direction. The hearing also highlighted other contributing factors, including the helicopter flying above its prescribed altitude. All 67 people on both aircraft were killed in the nation's deadliest plane crash since 2001.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced it will raise the U.S. prices for its original Switch family of products, including the standard, Lite, and OLED models, effective August 3. The company cited "market conditions" for the price hike, which comes as the Trump administration unveils a new wave of tariffs on imported goods. The price of the newly released Switch 2 console and all games will remain unchanged for now, though Nintendo noted that future adjustments may be necessary. The announcement followed a strong quarterly earnings report from the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

          <p>Two major wildfires in Arizona and Utah have become so intense that they are creating their own weather systems, including towering "fire clouds" known as pyrocumulus clouds. The Dragon Bravo fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has grown to over 164 square miles, making it the largest active fire in the continental U.S. These fire-generated clouds can produce powerful, unpredictable winds and even fire-fueled thunderstorms, posing extreme danger to firefighters and forcing crews to retreat. Experts note that such phenomena may become more common as climate change leads to more severe fire seasons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new security app called Balance is using artificial intelligence to help parents monitor their children's mental health and online habits. Developed by security company Aura, the tool analyzes a child's language patterns, tone, and online activity to detect anomalies that could signal stress or shifting moods, then provides reports to parents to facilitate dialogue. The CEO, who was motivated by his own daughter's struggles, worked with child psychologists to train the AI models. While proponents say it opens communication, advocacy groups argue that real change must come from tech companies and regulation.</p>
