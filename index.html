          <p>Former President Donald Trump sent a letter to the mother of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern who was killed in a Washington, D.C. shooting. The letter expresses deep condolences for the "senseless act of violence" and includes a promise to continue fighting for law and order. The article provides context on the unsolved shooting, where Tarpinian-Jachym was an unintended victim, and includes moving quotes from his mother about his character and aspirations. The tragic event underscores ongoing concerns about violent crime in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators is urging the administration to suspend funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), citing concerns over its controversial and deadly aid distribution methods. Their letter to the Secretary of State highlights the high number of Palestinian casualties at GHF sites and calls for resuming support for established UN-led mechanisms. This political pressure comes as the United Nations warns of a worsening humanitarian crisis and growing risk of mass starvation in Gaza, with international allies also criticizing the GHF's operations.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are anticipated to extend their current tariff truce by another three months during upcoming trade talks in Stockholm, according to sources close to the negotiations. The original 90-day suspension of most tariffs, agreed upon in May, was set to expire in August. While this extension signals a mutual commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, significant breakthroughs on major sticking points like industrial overcapacity are not expected. The Chinese delegation is also likely to press the US on separate tariffs related to fentanyl trafficking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A protest on the Greek island of Syros against an Israeli cruise ship has sparked a heated national debate about the Gaza conflict and antisemitism. Around 300 demonstrators carrying Palestinian flags prevented the MS Crown Iris from docking, leading the cruise line to bypass the port entirely. The incident highlights a divided public opinion in Greece, with polls suggesting that support for Israel has declined significantly since the start of the war. The event is one of several recent pro-Palestinian actions in a country that has maintained close ties with Israel.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in specific parts of Gaza to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid amid a worsening hunger crisis.

This development follows intense international pressure and stark images of malnutrition, although fighting continues in other areas of the territory.

According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a major factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. Faced with less time, teams are forced to eliminate busywork and streamline processes, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control over their work. This feeling of professional competence, combined with improved work-life balance, contributes to overall well-being and job satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Charities are warning that nearly £275 million in Child Trust Funds (CTFs) designated for disadvantaged young people in the UK remain unclaimed. These tax-free savings accounts were set up by the government for children born between 2002 and 2011, with larger initial deposits for those from low-income families. The Share Foundation, which helps locate these funds, is calling for an automatic release mechanism to ensure the money reaches account holders when they turn 21. Without action, the charity warns nearly £1 billion for low-income young adults could lie dormant by the end of this parliament. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French companies are being forced to adjust their strategies in Africa as France's long-standing sphere of influence, particularly in the Sahel region, continues to collapse. The traditional "Francafrique" policy, which gave French businesses preferential treatment, is being rejected by former colonies, opening the door to increased competition from China, Turkey, and Russia. In response, some French multinationals are diversifying into English-speaking African countries, while others are adopting more indirect strategies, such as forming joint ventures and local partnerships to maintain a market presence without high visibility.</p>

          <p>This article profiles 18-month-old Mohammad Al-Motawaq, a child in Gaza who is suffering from severe malnutrition, embodying the enclave's deepening hunger crisis. His widowed mother, herself malnourished, is unable to find food or milk for him as aid remains scarce and pediatric wards have closed. Doctors warn that chronic malnutrition is causing irreversible damage to a generation of Gaza's children, with long-term neurological and developmental consequences. The story provides a harrowing, human face to UN statistics that indicate mass starvation is threatening the territory's most vulnerable residents.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, has met with the Deputy US Attorney General for two days of interviews. The meetings come as the Trump administration faces political pressure over its handling of files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered all questions truthfully without invoking any privilege. However, legal experts question what new information she might provide now, given she maintained her innocence at trial, and whether her testimony can be considered credible, making it unclear if this will lead to any reprieve for her.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis posits that Donald Trump's political and economic worldview is fundamentally driven by an insatiable greed, or avarice, rooted in his career as a real-estate dealmaker. The article argues that his actions are not primarily about power, glory, or prestige, but about the endless accumulation of money itself. His focus on tariffs is presented as a way to disrupt impersonal markets and create adversarial, personal deals where he can claim victory. This egocentric approach, termed "egonomics," is evident in his ventures, including the highly profitable world of cryptocurrency, which perfectly combines dealmaking with self-enrichment.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of stabilizing under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement one year ago to lead the company. The manufacturer's aircraft production has increased, deliveries have hit an 18-month high, and its stock is up over 30% this year. While still facing challenges, including an FAA production cap on the 737 MAX and delays on other models, Ortberg's hands-on approach has been praised by airline customers and analysts. The company is expected to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year.</p>

          <p>In Bogotá, Colombia, motorists are falling victim to a scam where vandals known as "pinchallantas" intentionally puncture car tires on busy streets. These saboteurs, often on motorcycles, spread sharp objects and then direct the stranded drivers to nearby mechanics who are allegedly part of the scheme. The mechanics then often claim there are multiple holes and overcharge for the repairs. Despite a recent surge in complaints and a police crackdown on suspect repair shops, the fast-moving nature of the con makes it difficult to stop.</p>
