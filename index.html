          <h2>Apple's Market Value Plummets Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Apple's market capitalization has decreased by nearly $640 billion over three days due to worries that President Trump's tariffs will significantly impact the company. Analysts suggest Apple may need to raise prices or absorb tariff costs, potentially increasing the price of its highest-end iPhone by $350. The company's reliance on China for manufacturing makes it particularly vulnerable to trade war repercussions, despite having production facilities in other countries also facing increased tariffs. This downturn contrasts with the performance of other megacap tech companies, and Apple declined to comment on the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump dismissed the possibility of pausing tariffs despite ongoing market volatility, asserting that the U.S. is engaged in negotiations with numerous countries. He also threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs and indicated additional tariffs on China may be imposed for retaliatory measures. A senior White House official mentioned a potential total tariff of 104% on Chinese goods. Trump's stance has contributed to market uncertainty as the new tariffs are about to go into effect, and the administration appears firm on its trade policies.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs against China, leading to concerns about a potential U.S. recession. Major indexes initially fell, briefly rebounded on a false report of a tariff freeze, and then declined again. Economists at Goldman Sachs have increased the odds of a recession to 45%, citing the impact of tariffs. Global markets also suffered losses, and analysts suggest the near-term future of equity prices is heavily dependent on President Trump's decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, plays a crucial role in determining what can be included in President Trump's tax and spending cut bill based on Senate budget rules. Her decisions could significantly impact the bill's trajectory, as an adverse ruling could lead to a Senate filibuster. House conservatives are pushing for steep spending cuts, but Senate budget rules may limit the depth of those cuts. The Trump administration believes the tax cuts will alleviate tariff anxiety, though Democrats argue tariffs are being used to balance the tax cuts.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 'China Shock' and Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 2013 paper by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, known as the 'China shock' paper, found that increased US manufacturing imports from China led to job losses in the US. This research has influenced the shift in attitudes towards trade, with many now supporting tariffs. However, the authors' conclusions are more nuanced, emphasizing the 'shock' of rapid economic change rather than solely focusing on trade policy. Trump's tariffs are expected to introduce uncertainty and replicate the negative aspects of the China shock without the benefits of economic growth and cheaper goods.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered a new review of the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, reversing President Biden's earlier block of the deal. Trump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to reassess the acquisition and determine if further action is needed. U.S. Steel stock surged in response to the decision. Trump previously indicated a potential softening of his stance after meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>The current market crash, triggered by stringent tariffs imposed by President Trump, deviates from typical downturns rooted in external economic factors. This makes relying on past market patterns challenging for future predictions. Financial experts advise investors to maintain a long-term perspective, with those nearing retirement advised to secure cash reserves.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is facing criticism for using the word "peasants" to describe the Chinese population during a defense of President Trump's tariffs on Fox News. Vance's remarks have been labeled as dehumanizing and hypocritical, given his own upbringing in poverty. Social media users have expressed shock and disgust at Vance's choice of words, with some pointing out the irony of his condescending tone towards a nation that the U.S. is indebted to.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, adding to a 10% global tax on all imports to the U.S., with some countries facing higher specific levies. These tariffs are intended to address trade imbalances and boost domestic manufacturing, but economists predict they will likely reignite inflation and prompt retaliatory tariffs. China has already announced retaliatory measures, and the European Union is considering countermeasures. A full list of reciprocal tariffs by country has been released.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the country does not withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory 34% import fee on American products. This would bring the total U.S. tariffs on imports from China to 104%. The tariffs are in addition to previously announced levies aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. Economists warn that the trade war could harm economic growth and potentially trigger a recession.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a Trump supporter, has urged President Trump to pause his recently announced trade tariffs, warning of a "self-induced, economic nuclear winter." Ackman suggested a three-month period for countries to renegotiate trade relationships with the U.S. Other prominent Wall Street figures, including JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon, echoed these concerns, stating that Trump's tariffs risk pushing up prices for Americans. The White House has dismissed rumors of a pause, indicating a commitment to the new import taxes.</p>
