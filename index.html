          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense questioning from a Senate committee regarding his leadership and recent changes to U.S. vaccine policies. Lawmakers from both parties challenged his previous assurances, citing the dismissal of a key vaccine advisory panel and conflicting public statements on immunizations. Kennedy defended his actions as necessary reforms for an agency that he claimed "failed miserably during Covid," leading to heated exchanges with senators who accused him of spreading misinformation and restricting vaccine access. The hearing highlighted deep concerns over the direction of public health under his tenure.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock price dropped significantly after the company issued a full-year earnings and revenue forecast that fell far short of Wall Street's expectations. While second-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, revenue was slightly below projections, and the company cited the impact of tariffs and the removal of certain import tax exemptions as major factors in its reduced guidance. CEO Calvin McDonald also acknowledged that some of the brand's product offerings, particularly in casual wear, have become "stale" and are not resonating with customers. The company plans to refresh its product lines to regain momentum in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

In a rare public appearance, she spoke about the need to prepare children for an AI-driven future, building on her previous "Be Best" initiative. Despite maintaining a relatively private profile, she has been instrumental in legislative efforts, such as the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.

          <p>Homeowners are advised to carefully evaluate several key questions before taking out a home equity loan, especially with a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut on the horizon. The article suggests assessing the actual amount of equity available, determining the urgency of financial needs, and weighing the benefits of borrowing now versus waiting for potentially lower rates. It also contrasts fixed-rate home equity loans with variable-rate HELOCs, urging borrowers to consider their tolerance for future rate volatility. Making an informed decision is crucial to avoid the risk of foreclosure if repayment becomes unmanageable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles' highly effective and controversial short-yardage play, known as the "tush push" or "brotherly shove," is set to return for the upcoming NFL season. The play, which involves teammates pushing quarterback Jalen Hurts forward, survived a proposed ban during an offseason vote by NFL owners. Opponents have raised concerns about fairness and safety, but the league found no evidence of increased injury risk associated with the tactic. The Eagles have defended the play as a skillful execution that any team is free to attempt, setting the stage for its continued use in their season opener.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of stablecoins, digital assets pegged to traditional currencies, presents a significant challenge for Beijing, as over 99% of them are backed by the U.S. dollar. This dominance reinforces the dollar's global financial power, a trend that runs counter to China's efforts to promote the yuan and reduce reliance on its economic rival. While stablecoins offer the efficiency of digital currency, their overwhelming link to the dollar creates a strategic dilemma for Chinese policymakers. They must now consider how to respond to this emerging financial technology that could further entrench American influence in the digital economy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the temporary removal of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), while a legal battle over her dismissal continues. President Trump's attempt to fire her was previously blocked by lower courts, which cited federal laws providing tenure protections to members of independent regulatory agencies to shield them from political pressure. The administration argues that the modern FTC wields more power than in the past, and therefore its commissioners should serve at the president's will, challenging a long-standing legal precedent.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are experiencing a powerful "rotten egg" smell caused by a large amount of invasive Japanese seaweed that washed ashore during Hurricane Erin. City officials explained that the seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica, was pushed into the Good Harbor estuary by the storm's high winds and rough surf. As the seaweed decomposes without being pulled back out by strong tides, it releases the unpleasant odor. While the smell is a natural part of the decay process, it has become a significant nuisance for residents and visitors in the East Gloucester area.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated Los Lobos and Los Choneros, two of Ecuador's most powerful criminal gangs, as foreign terrorist organizations. The designation allows Washington to impose sanctions, freeze assets, and increase intelligence sharing with Ecuador to combat the groups, which are heavily involved in cocaine trafficking. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the move during a visit to Quito, pledging additional security and technology assistance to support Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa's "war" on organized crime. This action reflects a tougher U.S. regional strategy against narco-trafficking organizations.</p>

          <p>An internal NFL report from the 2024 season reveals a wide disparity in ticket revenue among its 32 teams, with the San Francisco 49ers leading the league with $176.5 million in net receipts. This figure was significantly higher than the second-place Dallas Cowboys and well above the league average. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tennessee Titans ranked last in ticket revenue. The report also details how teams contribute a portion of their gate receipts to a shared pool, which is then redistributed to ensure a degree of financial parity across the league.

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating California privacy laws by improperly tracking the activity of millions of smartphone users. The class-action lawsuit, which covered a period from 2016 to 2024, argued that Google collected user data even when privacy controls were enabled, using it to sell targeted ads. While the damages awarded were far less than the $30 billion sought by the plaintiffs, the verdict was hailed as a victory for consumer privacy. Google has denied any wrongdoing and stated its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>This article provides a fact-check of several claims made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during a contentious Senate hearing. It refutes his assertion that "nobody knows" how many lives COVID-19 vaccines saved, citing multiple studies from organizations like the WHO that estimate millions of deaths were prevented. The piece also corrects his statements on the accessibility of COVID booster shots, the total number of U.S. COVID deaths, and the number of required childhood vaccines. The analysis concludes that the secretary ignored available data and made numerous misleading statements on key public health topics.</p>

          <p>This analysis of Daniel Levy's 24-year tenure as Tottenham's chairman concludes his legacy will be a complex one, marked by a stark contrast between business success and sporting frustration. He is credited with transforming the club's infrastructure, most notably building a state-of-the-art stadium and training facility, making Spurs a highly profitable entity. However, this financial acumen was often seen by fans as a lack of on-field ambition, resulting in only two major trophies during his long reign. Ultimately, his time in charge will be remembered for both the world-class facilities he built and the consistent failure to translate that success into silverware.</p>
