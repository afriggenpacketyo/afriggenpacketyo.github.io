The Angolan Student Movement (MEA) highlights deteriorating conditions, including a lack of basic furniture, teaching materials, and rising tuition fees. While the government has pledged hundreds of millions of euros for improvements and blames the opposition for orchestrating the unrest, unions are threatening a nationwide strike, increasing pressure on President Joao Lourenco's administration ahead of the 2027 elections.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, an influential 31-year-old conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA, was assassinated while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. He was struck by a single bullet, which law enforcement believes was fired from the roof of a nearby building. The incident has sent shockwaves across the U.S. political landscape, drawing condemnation from figures across the spectrum and highlighting the growing concern over politically motivated violence. A major manhunt is currently underway for the shooter.</p>

          <p>The FBI has joined state and local authorities in the search for the person who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk, appealing to the public for tips and video evidence. In the aftermath, President Donald Trump released a video blaming the "demonizing" rhetoric of the "radical Left" for fostering a climate of violence. While the shooting has received bipartisan condemnation, the immediate political finger-pointing underscores the deep divisions and tensions prevalent in the United States.</p>

The landmark case was brought by two couples who had been denied the right for the husband to change his name upon marriage.

The final merged black hole was observed to have a larger surface area than the sum of the two initial black holes, providing observational evidence for a long-held prediction about the fundamental nature of the universe.</p>

          <p>The Brightline West project, which aims to become the first true high-speed rail line in the United States, is grappling with financial pressures despite having broken ground. To manage its projected $12 billion cost, the company made compromises such as placing its Southern California terminal in Rancho Cucamonga, 40 miles east of Los Angeles. Skeptics and investors are concerned about rising construction costs and whether the company can meet its ambitious financial and ridership projections to ensure the project's success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece analyzes the starkly different reactions of Donald Trump's supporters to various allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The author argues that the base's intense fury over Trump's association with Jeffrey Epstein is rooted in a selective, sentimentalized defense of abused girls, which serves as a moral justification within their ideology. In contrast, accusations from adult, successful, and liberal women like E. Jean Carroll do not fit this narrow victim narrative and are therefore dismissed or ignored.</p>

The proposal is aimed at further crippling Russia's war economy, but analysts believe European officials are highly unlikely to agree. The EU is seen as wary of alienating key global trade partners and adopting Trump's aggressive tariff-based foreign policy, especially while the U.S. simultaneously pursues its own trade deals with those same nations.
