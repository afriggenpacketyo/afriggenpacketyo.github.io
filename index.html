          <p>President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping by phone, focusing primarily on trade, according to both leaders. The call, initiated by Trump, aimed to address ongoing trade tensions between the two countries after constructive talks in Switzerland last month. The two countries had temporarily lowered tariffs on each other's goods following the talks, but the Trump administration has accused Beijing of slow-walking its pledge to approve the export of more critical minerals. China, in turn, has expressed frustration with new restrictions on Chinese student visas and warnings against using Chinese semiconductors. Optimism score is self-contained and does not influence the summary.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman who claimed she experienced discrimination in job promotions. The court found that members of majority groups in protected classes do not need to meet a higher standard of evidence to establish discrimination. Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, argued she was discriminated against after being passed over for a promotion in favor of a lesbian woman and later replaced by a gay man. The ruling strikes down the Sixth Circuit Court's "background circumstances" rule, but the court notes that Ohio had "alternative arguments" for why the Ohio government's treatment of Ames was justified.</p>

The White House stated the restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from foreign actors who are not properly vetted.

          <p>Oscar Pistorius, the former Olympic and paralympic runner convicted of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, participated in an Ironman triathlon in Durban, South Africa. This marks his first race since his release on parole in January 2024, having served nine years in prison for the crime. Pistorius, known as "Blade Runner" for his prosthetic legs, completed the race in 5:56:39, finishing 555th overall and third in the physically challenged category. The race consisted of a 1.24-mile swim, 55.9-mile bike ride, and 13-mile run, marking his return to competitive sports after a significant period of incarceration and public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Proposed tariffs by President Trump could substantially raise the prices of imported goods such as clothing and shoes. A retail consultancy group, AlixPartners, estimates that a 30% tariff on goods from China could increase prices by about 19%, while a 145% tariff could spike prices by roughly 90%. Similarly, tariffs on goods from Vietnam could lead to price increases of 8% to 35%, depending on the tariff level. Retailers may attempt to offset some of these costs, but the levies could still significantly impact U.S. households, potentially affecting consumer spending and retail profitability.

          <p>Medications and supplements can expire, potentially becoming less effective or even harmful, so it's important to check expiration dates regularly. Pharmacist Stacia Woodcock advises against taking expired medication, as expiration dates ensure safety and efficacy. The FDA acknowledges that some properly stored medications may remain stable beyond their expiration date, but it is generally best to err on the side of caution. Proper storage in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet or pantry, rather than a bathroom, can help prolong medication effectiveness, and medication take-back locations are the best way to dispose of expired or unwanted medications.</p>

He highlighted staff shortages at the National Weather Service and NOAA, leading to a reduction in weather balloon releases and potentially impacting the accuracy of hurricane forecasts.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed plans for the review but did not specify its scope or timeline, but experts say concerns about its safety are misguided. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000 after a comprehensive review determined it was safe and effective, and periodic reviews have not found new safety concerns. This review could potentially impact access to the medication, depending on whether the FDA strictly follows the science and its own safety reviews.</p>

          <p>The autopen, a machine that automates a person's signature, has become a focus of political debate following allegations by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons. An autopen uses a pen or other writing instrument to replicate a person's signature on documents, and presidents have relied on them for routine correspondence and legislation. While Trump also used an autopen for unimportant papers, he criticized Biden's alleged use of the technology for signing pardons. The Justice Department concluded in 2005 that it was constitutional for a president to use an autopen to sign a bill.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that 81% of next-generation millionaires plan to replace their parents' wealth management firms, signaling a potential shift in the wealth management industry. The $100 trillion wealth transfer from older to younger generations is set to reshape the industry, as younger investors seek new advisors with better digital offerings and a wider range of services and products. Capgemini's survey shows that a majority of wealth-management executives recognize the importance of engaging with the next generation but find it challenging to build relationships. The new breed of inherited wealth investors born between 1965 and 2012 have different priorities, investing styles, and lifestyles than baby boomers.</p>
