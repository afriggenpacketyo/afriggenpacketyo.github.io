          <p>The United States embassy in China has revised its visa application process for children under 14, eliminating the interview waiver. As of Tuesday, these young applicants must attend an in-person interview accompanied by at least one parent, along with providing documents to verify identities. This policy change has created confusion among study abroad consultants, as the previous rules allowed for an interview-free application process for this age group. The new regulations aim to enhance security measures and ensure thorough verification of applicants' information, though some exceptions may apply to applications submitted before Tuesday. Optimism is tempered by the potential disruption to families and educational exchanges.</p>

          <p>The Group of Seven nations are considering forgoing a joint statement at the conclusion of their upcoming summit in Canada, marking a potential departure from tradition. This move is reportedly aimed at preventing the G7 from highlighting internal disagreements, particularly in light of differing viewpoints among leaders since the start of Donald Trump's presidency. The decision reflects a desire to maintain an image of unity in addressing global challenges, even as underlying tensions persist. This development signals a shift in the dynamics of international cooperation among major economies, with a focus on managing perceptions rather than achieving complete consensus.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has experienced several days of protests triggered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in areas with large Latino populations, leading to numerous arrests. President Trump deployed National Guard troops to the city, escalating tensions and drawing criticism from Democrats who believe local police can manage the situation. The protests, initially peaceful, turned violent with incidents of vehicles being set on fire and a major highway being shut down, with the downtown Federal Building becoming a focal point. The deployment of the National Guard has sparked legal challenges, with California Governor Gavin Newsom suing the Trump administration, arguing the move violates states' rights.</p>

A 23-year-old Zapotec man was allegedly deported after mistakenly signing a deportation form, while families report receiving distressed calls from detained relatives. These accounts contradict officials' claims that the raids primarily targeted individuals with criminal records, as immigrant advocacy groups say many detainees have no such records.

A large portion of these Republican ACA users identify as "MAGA" Republicans, creating a potential conflict as the party weighs legislation that could reduce access to health insurance. The ACA provides coverage for many self-employed individuals and those in states that did not expand Medicaid, making it a vital resource for a segment of the Republican base.

          <p>Israel deported activist Greta Thunberg after intercepting a Gaza-bound ship carrying aid, stating that the vessel intended to breach its naval blockade. Thunberg was among 12 passengers on the ship, which aimed to protest Israel's ongoing war in Gaza and highlight the humanitarian crisis. The seizure has been condemned by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and rights groups as a violation of international law, while Israel maintains its actions are consistent with international law. Several activists have been deported, while others are being detained as the situation continues to unfold.</p>
