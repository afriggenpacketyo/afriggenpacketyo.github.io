          <p>Eric Spofford, the former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, was arrested for allegedly conspiring to stalk and intimidate journalists from New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR) in retaliation for their investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him. The Department of Justice stated that Spofford hired someone to vandalize the homes of the journalist and her family, including spraying threatening messages. Spofford had previously sued NHPR for defamation after the article led to financial and social repercussions for him, but the lawsuit was dismissed in 2023. Labarge, Cockerline, Saniatan and Waselchuck were charged, convicted and sentenced to prison for their involvement in the harassment campaign, while Spofford awaits his federal court appearance in Boston.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and individuals aged 12 to 64 with at least one health condition that increases their risk from the coronavirus. This new vaccine uses a lower dose than Moderna's existing vaccine and is not intended as a replacement, but rather as an additional option. The decision reflects skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration officials, differing from the U.S.'s previous approach to COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA's approval was based on a study that found the new vaccine to be safe and at least as effective as the original.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), one of the world's largest reforestation efforts, faces scrutiny as satellite data and field reports raise questions about its effectiveness. An analysis of satellite images suggests that some NGP land has experienced deforestation events, with native trees being cleared to grow cash crops. Investigators have exposed a pattern of "greenwashing," where commodities grown on these sites are falsely marketed as sustainable. The program struggles with natural resource plundering, replacing community forests with plantations of invasive exotic species, and limited community support, leading to illegal logging activities.</p>

Musk denied the allegations, stating that he is "NOT taking drugs" and that the Times had lied, though he admitted to trying prescription ketamine a few years ago. Musk's role as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration involved overseeing the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can result in penalties that can increase premiums for life, but there are exceptions. If you or a spouse is still working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can generally opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying enrollment also allows your husband to continue making contributions on your behalf to his health savings account. Medicare suggests confirming with the employer’s benefits department to ensure appropriate coverage and eligibility to delay application.</p>
