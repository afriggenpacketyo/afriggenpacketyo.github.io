        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is facing significant disruptions due to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and recent radar outages, causing flight delays up to seven hours. The Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.) acknowledged the understaffing at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark's air traffic, with reports indicating far fewer certified controllers on duty than required. These issues, combined with equipment and technology failures, have shaken travelers' confidence in the airport. The F.A.A. plans infrastructure upgrades and flight reductions to mitigate delays, while United Airlines assures customers of flight safety despite the ongoing challenges. The article also notes a political dimension, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blaming the Biden administration for the situation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project aimed at replacing the aging Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel. The project's estimated cost has ballooned to $8.5 billion, prompting the search for more efficient construction methods. The Department of Transportation confirmed that the Boring Company is among several firms being consulted for a new engineering contract. This move raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to Musk's various business ventures and his role advising President Trump on government efficiency.</p>

Prime Minister Modi stated that India will monitor Pakistan's moves following a cease-fire agreement, and Japan's rice prices have fallen for the first time in 18 weeks due to government measures.

          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli hostage, after more than 19 months in Gaza captivity as President Trump departed for a trip to the Middle East. Alexander, who was abducted during the Hamas-orchestrated attack on October 7, 2023, was transferred to the Red Cross and then to the Israel Defense Forces. Hamas stated that the release was unconditional, hoping to advance a lasting ceasefire and renew humanitarian aid to Gaza, while Netanyahu's office affirmed Israel's commitment to returning all hostages. The release comes amid dire warnings about the risk of famine in Gaza due to restricted aid, and reports of Israeli strikes on a school-turned-shelter, resulting in multiple casualties.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring drugmakers to reduce their prices to match those in other high-income countries, threatening to impose steep caps on Medicare earnings if they fail to comply. He aims to expand the "most favored nation" concept, ensuring the U.S. pays the lowest global price for prescription drugs. The White House plans to develop new rules to revive price caps in Medicare and allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the most favored nation price. Drug manufacturers oppose this, arguing it could stifle innovation and harm biotech companies. The industry suggests addressing foreign countries not paying their fair share and middlemen driving up prices.</p>

          <p>The Episcopal church's migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white South Africans granted refugee status, citing its commitment to racial justice and reconciliation. President Trump opened a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, accusing their government of discrimination, even as his administration abruptly shut down the overall US refugee program. The church views this as preferential treatment over other refugees and will conclude its resettlement grant agreements with the US federal government by the end of the fiscal year. The church will find other ways to serve immigrants, such as those already in this country and those stranded overseas.</p>

          <p>For the first time in nearly 30 years, the EPA did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) obtained and published the data. The report indicates that while the U.S. has reduced its most potent greenhouse gas emissions, it is not on track to meet its climate goals, with gross greenhouse gas emissions dropping about 17% since 2005. The transportation sector remains the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions, and concerns are growing that the Trump administration's policies may reverse progress. The EDF emphasizes the need to accelerate emission reductions to meet science-based climate commitments.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled plans for a comprehensive tax bill that temporarily enacts President Trump's campaign promises, including tax exemptions for tips and overtime pay, while rolling back clean energy subsidies. The bill aims to extend provisions from Trump's 2017 tax law and create a new tax-advantaged investment account for children. However, the proposal faces criticism from within the Republican party, particularly regarding the state and local tax deduction limit. To offset the costs of these tax cuts, Republicans plan to raise taxes on Biden's agenda, universities, and migrants, with the legislation expected to add at least $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian testified in a Paris court as a witness in the 2016 burglary case where she was held at gunpoint and millions of dollars' worth of jewelry were stolen. The trial involves a group dubbed the 'grandpa robbers' due to their advanced age, with several denying involvement. Kardashian is expected to provide her account of the incident, while previous testimony described her as 'completely hysterical' during the robbery. The jewels were never recovered, and the case has drawn significant media attention.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration faces scrutiny for increasingly blurring the lines between public office and personal benefits, exemplified by the plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the so-called reciprocal duties for 90 days, in a surprise move that appears to be an about-face from their bitter trade war, prompting a surge in stock prices. The agreement means that the United States will cut its recent tariffs on China, imposed since Donald Trump's second presidency started in January, to 30 percent from 145 percent. The United States will also maintain a separate 20 percent levy imposed over what it views as Beijing's insufficient efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl into the country. The vice premier said the talks, which marked the first in-person interaction between senior officials of the two countries since the Trump administration ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports, was "an important step toward resolving differences" and laid the foundation for deepening cooperation, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.</p>
