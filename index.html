            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained under the Alien Enemies Act, a controversial 18th-century law. The ACLU argued that the detainees were at imminent risk of being deported to El Salvador without due process. The court's order prevents the government from removing the detainees until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. This action follows concerns that the detainees were not informed of their right to contest the deportation decision and were given notices in English despite some only speaking Spanish.</p>

            <p>The article discusses how Donald Trump's immigration policies align with authoritarian tactics used by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, particularly regarding the treatment of suspected gang members. It argues that Trump's approach, like Bukele's, involves undermining the rule of law and instilling fear to justify repressive measures. The author suggests that Trump is outsourcing aspects of his immigration crackdown to foreign entities, making it harder for domestic courts to intervene. The article highlights the human cost of these policies, citing cases of wrongful deportations and the suppression of dissent.</p>

            <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, as the Dodgers defeated the Rangers 3-0. Yamamoto's performance outshone Jacob deGrom, who allowed only one run in seven innings. Yamamoto utilized his entire repertoire of pitches, including an improved curveball, to keep the Rangers' hitters off balance. The victory further solidifies Yamamoto's status as a frontline talent and a potential Cy Young contender.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members under a wartime law. The ACLU argued that the men were at risk of imminent removal to an El Salvadoran prison. The order came after the ACLU filed multiple requests to halt the detainees' removal. The ACLU stated that Venezuelan detainees were being transferred to the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, and told they would be removed as soon as Friday night.</p>

The latest vote tally shows Lee with 53% of the vote compared to Taylor's 47%. Oakland uses ranked-choice elections, which may delay the final result. Lee is poised to replace ousted Mayor Sheng Thao, who was recalled from office due to voter frustration with crime and homelessness. Lee has pledged to address these issues while also advocating for social justice and economic equality.</p>

            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that Kilmar Ábrego García, mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been moved to a new prison. Van Hollen, who met with Ábrego García, stated that he was 'traumatised' and fearful in the original mega-jail, Cecot. While the Supreme Court has ordered the government to 'facilitate' his return, the White House maintains he will not be allowed back into the US, accusing him of being an MS-13 gang member, a claim his family and attorneys deny.</p>
