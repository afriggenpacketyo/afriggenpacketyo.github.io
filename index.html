          <h2>Senate Rejects Trump's Tariffs on Canada: A Bipartisan Rebuke</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to overturn President Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian goods, a largely symbolic bipartisan action with four Republicans joining Democrats.  The resolution, while non-binding, highlights concerns that the tariffs, justified by Trump as a measure to combat fentanyl trafficking, unfairly target a long-time ally.  Opponents argued the tariffs are a tax burden on American consumers, while supporters emphasized the need to address the fentanyl crisis. The House is unlikely to support the measure, and Trump has vowed to veto it.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa's recent success is attributed to their January transfer acquisitions, defying the typical high-risk perception of the winter transfer window.  Players like Marcus Rashford, Marco Asensio, and Donyell Malen, all signed in January, have significantly contributed to Villa's strong performance in the Premier League and FA Cup.  This showcases manager Unai Emery's ambitious approach and the club's progressive ownership.  The team's success serves as a testament to strategic winter signings.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer criticized President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, asserting they prioritize punishing trading partners over investor appeasement.

          <p>President Trump announced sweeping tariffs, imposing a 10% tariff on all foreign goods and significantly higher rates on certain countries.  These tariffs, if implemented, will likely lead to higher prices for consumers and potential economic downturn.  The president's authority to impose tariffs unilaterally is likely to face legal challenges.  Economists express skepticism about the plan's effectiveness in reviving U.S. manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The North Dakota Legislature proposed a change to voter-approved term limits, despite a constitutional provision prohibiting such action.  The measure, passed by the Senate and House, would alter term limits for state legislators and repeal the prohibition against legislative changes.  Supporters argue the original measure was misunderstood and that experienced lawmakers are needed.  Opponents contend this undermines the will of the voters.</p>
