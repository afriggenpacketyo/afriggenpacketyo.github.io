          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue to $28.10 billion, following two quarters of decline, yet its adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents fell short of analyst expectations. This earnings miss, along with a 37% decrease in net income attributed to lower EV prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses for AI and R&D, caused the stock to drop nearly 5%. CEO Elon Musk's emphasis on futuristic projects like the Cybercab and Optimus robots, rather than specific guidance, further fueled investor uncertainty. Despite record vehicle deliveries and growth in its energy business, challenges like a European sales slump and expiring tax credits impacted overall performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, stating they fund the Kremlin's "war machine" and citing President Putin's refusal to end the conflict in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the necessity of these measures to support President Trump's efforts for an immediate ceasefire. Trump himself described the sanctions as "tremendous" but expressed disappointment that his recent talks with Putin had not yielded progress towards peace. This move, which follows similar actions by the UK, aims to intensify economic pressure on Russia amidst ongoing international diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Despite a sharp policy divide with the US President Donald Trump dismissing climate change, Chinese President Xi Jinping has unveiled ambitious national strategies to address the issue. China aims to cut its emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to over 30%, focusing on wind and solar power. Driven by escalating risks of floods, heatwaves, and extreme weather, Beijing is actively re-engineering its urban landscapes and infrastructure to enhance resilience against a hotter and more unpredictable climate future. This proactive approach makes economic sense for the country's long-term stability.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrat Leader Calls for Prince Andrew to Face MPs Over Royal Lodge Lease</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 17:57:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has urged for Prince Andrew to appear before MPs to address questions about his lease of Royal Lodge, emphasizing the need for increased transparency in royal finances. This call for a select committee inquiry into the Crown Estate, which manages royal properties, follows Prince Andrew's recent relinquishment of royal titles due to his association with the late Jeffrey Epstein. Documents indicate that Andrew's lease involved significant upfront payments instead of substantial annual rent, a deal critics, including former Public Accounts Committee chair Baroness Margaret Hodge, have labeled as a "rotten deal" for taxpayers. The controversy highlights broader concerns about the secrecy surrounding royal financial arrangements.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats, under the leadership of Chuck Schumer, have once again blocked a Republican bid to reopen the government, marking the twelfth such failed attempt and prolonging the shutdown into its fourth week. President Trump criticized Democrats, asserting they had "lost the negotiation" and were now seeking to reclaim concessions. Conversely, Democrats are adamant about securing a deal to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies, making it a central demand in the ongoing stalemate. This political deadlock, exacerbated by a lengthy filibuster from Sen. Jeff Merkley, underscores deep partisan divisions and continues to impact federal operations and the financial stability of government workers.</p>

          <p>The fifth episode of "The Celebrity Traitors" saw contestants mired in self-doubt and frustration as they continued to fail in identifying the "Traitors." Following the elimination of another faithful, host Claudia Winkleman sternly criticized the celebrities for their repeated failures. Internally, tensions rose among the Traitors—Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, and Cat Burns—with Burns expressing suspicions about Ross. The episode culminated in a dramatic tied vote at the roundtable, leaving the next banishment to fate and intensifying the desperate search for the hidden deceivers. Social media users also voiced their exasperation, particularly regarding Jonathan Ross's continued presence in the game.</p>

The carrier further projected record sales for the current fourth quarter, anticipating a 1% to 3% rise in unit revenue, driven by robust travel demand and increased fares. Despite a year-over-year profit decrease, Southwest reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook and is actively working to boost sales by abandoning long-standing policies like open seating. These strategic shifts aim to improve competitiveness and capitalize on the current strong travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines how digital group chats have become a significant source of political trouble and security risks within the Trump administration, coining the term "Group-Chat Presidency." Recent incidents include a presidential nominee withdrawing after racially charged and inappropriate texts were disclosed, and Young Republican officials being exposed for offensive messages. A more alarming security breach involved top Defense officials discussing sensitive military operations in Yemen on an unencrypted Signal chat, inadvertently including a journalist. The author attributes these repeated fiascos to a combination of hubris regarding communication security, a competitive "edgelord" culture within certain political circles, and the general inexperience of some appointees in high-level government roles.</p>

          <p>The US Defense Department confirmed its eighth strike on an alleged drug vessel since September 2, this time occurring in international waters off the Pacific coast of Colombia, resulting in the deaths of two individuals. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was operated by a "designated terrorist organization" engaged in illicit narcotics smuggling. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly has raised questions regarding the legal and constitutional rationale for these strikes, noting that many Caribbean routes are primarily for cocaine bound for Europe, not fentanyl destined for the US. These operations, which have now caused at least 34 fatalities, are part of the Trump administration's declared "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels.</p>

Franklin D. Roosevelt added the original East Wing, and Harry Truman famously oversaw a complete structural overhaul. By contextualizing Trump's $200 million ballroom project, which is privately funded, the administration aims to frame it as a long-standing tradition of adapting and modernizing the historic presidential residence.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized US cattle ranchers, claiming they "don't understand" the positive impact of his tariffs and need to lower their prices. This statement came after ranchers voiced strong opposition to his proposal to import beef from Argentina, intended to reduce costs for American consumers. Trump argued that his 50% tariff on Brazilian beef imports was solely responsible for the ranchers' recent prosperity. However, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and several Republican senators have pushed back against the Argentine beef plan, cautioning that such government intervention could destabilize markets and harm family farmers. The issue highlights a divide between the administration's trade policy and industry concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices experienced their steepest single-day decline in over 12 years, falling by more than 6% and losing nearly $300 per ounce, following an extraordinary year-long rally. This sharp sell-off, which also affected silver, is attributed to widespread profit-taking, a strengthening US dollar making gold more expensive for international buyers, and a perceived easing of geopolitical and economic uncertainties. The article suggests that while the plunge caught many off guard, long-term investors might view this as an opportunity to add to their positions for hedging against future inflation and systemic risks. Diversification and careful monitoring of economic indicators are advised. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM announced third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 9% to $16.33 billion and adjusted earnings per share reaching $2.65. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance to "more than" 5% growth and increased its free cash flow estimate to $14 billion, attributing this success to ongoing artificial intelligence tailwinds. Despite these robust financial indicators and CEO Arvind Krishna's report of a rapidly growing AI book of business, the stock surprisingly dropped 5% in extended trading. This reaction may indicate investor caution or profit-taking after a period of strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a new memo mandating formal approval for almost all Department of Defense correspondence and interactions with Congress. This policy requires most Pentagon offices, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretaries of each military department, to coordinate all legislative affairs activities through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs. The memo, also signed by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg, asserts that "unauthorized engagements" could undermine the department's legislative priorities. Critics suggest this directive raises significant concerns about government transparency and the traditional system of checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches, potentially hindering congressional oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) highlights that traditional savings accounts yield essentially nonexistent returns, averaging only 0.40%, meaning savers are effectively losing money against inflation. Conversely, high-yield savings accounts continue to offer competitive rates, typically in the 4.20% to 4.30% range, with even higher rates potentially available online. This article demonstrates how even modest deposits can accrue hundreds of dollars in interest over a year, with compounding significantly boosting returns over time. Despite variable rates and potential future cuts, these accounts remain a considerably more lucrative option for storing savings compared to their traditional counterparts.

          <p>Carlitos Ricardo Parias, an influential Los Angeles TikTok creator known for livestreaming US immigration enforcement operations, was shot and arrested by federal agents and remains hospitalized. Authorities allege that Parias attempted to ram federal agents' vehicles in an effort to escape after being boxed in, leading an agent to open fire, injuring Parias and a deputy US marshal. Parias, who has a large online following and received community recognition for his "unfiltered portrayal of real life," now faces charges of assault on a federal officer. This incident underscores the escalating tensions surrounding the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaigns and the role of citizen journalists in documenting these events.</p>

          <p>Israeli lawmakers have voted to advance two proposed bills calling for the formal annexation of the West Bank, directly defying President Trump's past objections to such a move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged his Likud party members to abstain, with the party denouncing the vote as a "provocation" that could harm relations with the United States. The proposed legislation seeks to annex Maale Adumim and the entire West Bank, territories that Israel has occupied since 1967 and which are widely deemed illegal under international law. This controversial development unfolds as Vice President JD Vance visits Israel to reinforce the fragile Gaza ceasefire, further complicating regional peace efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to surge by 40% to $1.32 per pound this Thanksgiving, a substantial increase driven primarily by reduced supply. Avian flu outbreaks have significantly impacted over 3 million turkeys this year, contributing to a 3% decrease in the total number of birds raised by farmers compared to 2024. Despite this wholesale price hike, major retailers such as Walmart and Aldi are proactively offering discounted Butterball turkeys and comprehensive meal deals to attract budget-conscious consumers. Economists predict that while consumer prices might see an uptick, the increase will likely be less dramatic than the wholesale surge, as retailers traditionally use turkeys as "loss leaders" to draw shoppers.</p>

          <h2>Economic Study Predicts Larger Tax Refunds for Americans in 2026 Due to New Tax Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:10:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic study by Oxford Economics predicts that many Americans could see significantly larger tax refunds next year when filing their 2025 tax returns. This anticipated increase is attributed to new provisions within the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act, which are retroactive to the start of the current year. Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion, marking an 18% increase from the previous year's refunds. The new law extended tax reductions from 2017 and introduced new breaks, including the elimination of taxes on some overtime and tipped income, and a raised cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. However, analyses indicate that a "disproportionate share" of these benefits will primarily accrue to higher-income households. (not investment advice)</p>
