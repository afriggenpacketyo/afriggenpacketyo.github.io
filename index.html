          <p>BowFlex has issued a recall for millions of its adjustable dumbbells due to the risk of weight plates dislodging and causing injuries. The recall was prompted by over 100 reports of injuries, including concussions, abrasions, and broken toes. The recalled products include the BowFlex 552 and 1090 adjustable dumbbells, sold in pairs or as single units. Johnson Health Tech Retail, which acquired BowFlex assets after its bankruptcy, will provide refunds in the form of vouchers or replacement units for dumbbells purchased from them. Consumer Reports criticizes this remedy as insufficient, advocating for full refunds without conditions. Consumers are advised to stop using the dumbbells immediately and seek a refund via the provided claim form.</p>

          <p>England defeated West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series win with a game to spare after chasing down a target of 197. Jos Buttler and Harry Brook contributed solid scores, but Jacob Bethell's explosive cameo and Tom Banton's unbeaten innings sealed the victory. West Indies had earlier posted a substantial total, propelled by Rovman Powell and Jason Holder's late hitting after a slow start. Adil Rashid's expensive penultimate over proved costly for England, who had chosen to field only two seamers. The series concludes at Southampton on Tuesday, with England looking to complete a series sweep.</p>

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is attempting to shield the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" from the fallout of a public feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Musk has voiced strong opposition to the bill, prompting a heated exchange with Trump, who claimed Musk had "lost his mind." Johnson, who once had a close relationship with Musk, is now trying to refocus attention on the legislative agenda. While some Republicans acknowledge Musk's potential influence on the bill's passage, others are urging unity and an end to the dispute. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sees the clash as an opportunity to undermine the GOP tax plan.</p>

Newsom has accused Trump of deploying the National Guard to create a spectacle rather than address a law enforcement shortage. Noem contrasted Newsom's actions with those of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz during the 2020 riots, emphasizing Trump's commitment to law and order. The National Guard soldiers are specifically trained for crowd control and security operations in the affected areas.</p>

Advocates for immigrants' rights have reported detentions outside various businesses, while law enforcement has clashed with demonstrators, resulting in arrests.

Zelenskyy believes that only "hard pressure" led by the U.S. and joined by European allies would render Putin to be "pragmatic" in his thinking. He endorsed an unconditional ceasefire and rejected Trump's characterization of the war as a "playground" dispute. Zelenskyy called for US sanctions and "intermediaries" to bring about a ceasefire, emphasizing the need for a strong third party to put pressure on the aggressor.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak traced to a large egg recall has resulted in dozens of illnesses across seven states in the West and Midwest, according to federal health officials. August Egg Company recalled approximately 1.7 million brown organic and cage-free eggs due to potential salmonella contamination. At least 79 people have been infected with the outbreak strain, leading to 21 hospitalizations. The recalled eggs were distributed to stores in Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Washington, and Wyoming. The CDC advises consumers to discard or return recalled eggs and disinfect any surfaces they contacted.</p>
