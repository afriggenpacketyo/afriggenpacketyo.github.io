          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to inclement weather, specifically thunderstorms. The start was pushed back to 16:43 BST on Saturday, impacting the original tee times. Practice was also temporarily suspended earlier due to the threat of lightning in the area, and the tee times were revised to accommodate the delay. This change affected players such as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Xander Schauffele, who were scheduled to tee off in the second group.</p>

The recording, obtained by Axios, captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, providing a fuller picture of why Hur described him as an 'elderly man with a poor memory' in his report on Biden's handling of classified information. This development follows the release of a forthcoming book detailing instances of Biden's cognitive decline and advisers' efforts to suppress discussions of his age-related limitations.</p>

          <p>Three men have been charged with offenses under the National Security Act for allegedly targeting UK-based journalists with the intent to inflict serious violence on them. The men, who had been granted temporary leave to remain in the UK after claiming asylum, are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service, namely that of Iran. The charges follow a complex investigation, and authorities have emphasized the importance of avoiding any reporting that could prejudice the proceedings.</p>

These Active Clubs, smaller networks where members train in mixed martial arts, foster bonding over white nationalist ideologies and maintain an online presence to encourage radicalization. Patriot Front uses these clubs to expand their reach while evading law enforcement and researchers. The recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, after years of controversies and lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings has downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and rising interest costs. This decision aligns Moody's with other major credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which had previously downgraded the U.S. The downgrade reflects concerns over the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. The fiscal deficit in the year that began October 1 is already running at $1.05 trillion, 13% higher than a year ago.</p>
