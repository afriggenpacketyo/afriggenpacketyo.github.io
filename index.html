          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City's Police Commissioner during the 9/11 attacks, has died at the age of 69. Kerik rose rapidly through the ranks to become the city's chief law enforcement officer under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. His career later faced significant challenges and controversies, overshadowing his earlier achievements in law enforcement and public service, yet his leadership during the 9/11 crisis remains a significant part of his legacy. His tenure as commissioner was marked by both notable successes and subsequent scandals. </p>

          <p>A 16-year-old in Maryland, accused of breaking into 121 cars in one night, was released within five hours of his arrest, frustrating local police. Authorities found nearly 20 sets of car keys and credit cards at the teen's home, linking him to the break-ins. The state Department of Juvenile Services deemed the offenses as lower-level crimes due to the teen's lack of prior record, allowing his release. Police are concerned about the lack of accountability and the potential for continued criminal activity, especially after 17 more car break-ins occurred the night after his release.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's order that ruled President Trump overstepped his power by imposing global tariffs. The White House argued that the trade court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations. The appeals court's decision allows the tariffs to remain in effect while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5. The initial ruling by the trade court would have voided tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as a blanket 10% import tax on goods from other countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's four-month tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) is ending, marked by controversial efforts to cut government spending.

          <p>An investigation into stolen pickup truck tailgates in Houston uncovered a scheme where thieves use high-tech tools to clone key fobs and steal vehicles. Victims tracked down suspects online, leading to the discovery of blank key fobs and a key programming device. Authorities are warning vehicle owners to take precautions as key fob-related car thefts rise in the area. Thieves can steal a car in as little as five minutes using this method.</p>

          <p>Major USDA cuts are severely impacting food banks and school food programs in North Carolina, reducing access to local produce for students and families. The Trump administration cut over $1 billion in annual funding to programs like Local Food for Schools and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement. This has led to school districts and food banks losing significant revenue, forcing them to reduce services and lay off staff. Local farmers are also affected, with reduced sales impacting their ability to support the community.</p>
