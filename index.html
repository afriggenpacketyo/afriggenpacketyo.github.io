          <p>A recent tentative deal between Air Canada and its flight attendants, which includes partial pay for ground time, has intensified the push for similar compensation in the United States. Unions representing tens of thousands of US flight attendants argue that their members deserve to be paid for all hours worked, including the critical tasks performed during boarding and deplaning. This movement highlights a long-standing industry practice where cabin crews are often not compensated until the aircraft doors close, leading to financial hardship for many workers.</p>

          <p>The bipartisan proposal to exempt tipped income from federal taxes is gaining popularity but faces criticism for its economic shortcomings. Experts argue the policy arbitrarily benefits certain blue-collar workers over others and disproportionately helps higher-earning tipped employees, while offering no relief to those who earn too little to owe federal taxes. The article suggests this form of anti-technocratic populism could entrench inefficient compensation methods and encourage tax avoidance, ultimately undermining broader economic fairness.

          <p>The average value of an NFL team has climbed to $7.65 billion, an 18% increase from the previous year, solidifying the league's status as the world's most valuable sports entity. The Dallas Cowboys remain the most valuable franchise at $12.5 billion, with eleven teams now exceeding an $8 billion valuation. This growth is driven by massive media rights deals and strong national revenue streams, which are shared equally among all 32 teams, further enhanced by new equity deals like the NFL's stake in ESPN.

The incident on Water Street resulted in injuries to over 130 people, including children. During his appearance at Liverpool Crown Court via videolink, his defense team raised concerns about significant difficulties in accessing him in prison to prepare for the trial, which is now scheduled for late November.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin recently stated that Moscow has never objected to Ukraine joining the European Union, a comment that contrasts sharply with his staunch opposition to its potential NATO membership. Observers speculate this is a tactical maneuver aimed at appearing conciliatory to the US while buying time, as the EU accession process is lengthy and complex. Experts suggest Putin may be trying to secure a commitment against Ukraine's NATO entry and could use allies within the EU, like Hungary and Slovakia, to obstruct the membership process later.</p>

          <p>Tax experts suggest that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner could face a penalty in addition to paying an estimated £40,000 in underpaid stamp duty on a property she purchased. The issue revolves around whether the flat was a second home, which incurs a higher tax rate, a fact complicated by a trust set up for her son. Rayner claims she received incorrect legal advice, but specialists argue that simply relying on an adviser may not be a sufficient defense against a "carelessness" penalty from HM Revenue and Customs.</p>

The approach involves starting with limited functions, like a family photo album, and slowly adding features such as a camera, audiobooks, and eventually calling family members. This method aims to foster digital literacy from a young age and turn technology use into an ongoing conversation between parents and children, preparing them for an increasingly tech-dependent world.</p>

          <p>FIFA has announced it will use a dynamic ticket pricing model for the 2026 World Cup, a move that critics are calling a form of price-gouging that prioritizes profit over fans. While initial prices are set, the algorithm will adjust them based on demand, which is expected to cause costs to soar, especially since tickets go on sale before the tournament draw is known. This strategy effectively absorbs the secondary resale market, allowing FIFA itself to capture the profits while potentially pricing out many ordinary supporters from the world's most popular sporting event.</p>

The article argues for a nuanced conversation about why students cheat, the mixed messages they receive about AI, and how education must adapt to a world where these tools are ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>This opinion column contends that California's once-successful economic model, built on higher education and infrastructure investment, is now broken, pushing middle and working-class jobs to more business-friendly states. The aerospace and defense industries are used as a prime example, where companies develop cutting-edge technology in California but move manufacturing operations to states with lower costs and fewer regulations. The author argues that unless the state modernizes its approach to energy, land use, and industrial support, it will continue to lose out on vital economic growth.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece expresses alarm over the normalization of armed, camouflage-clad National Guard troops patrolling the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The author contrasts the current scene with decades of visiting the capital's landmarks, noting that the heavy military and Department of Homeland Security presence is a recent development under the Trump administration. The column argues this deployment represents an excessive use of federal force, creating a de facto national police force that undermines local policing and American norms.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man, Joshua Michael Richardson, who identified himself as "Michael the Angel of Death," has been charged with multiple felonies after allegedly threatening a Catholic monastery in Orange County.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren argues that the Senate Banking Committee should investigate President Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence rather than proceeding with a routine confirmation hearing for his nominee. Warren highlights Trump's threats to fire Chairman Jerome Powell and other board members as a dangerous politicization of the central bank. She warns that undermining the Fed's autonomy could erode confidence in the economy, ultimately leading to higher costs for American consumers on mortgages and loans. (not investment advice)</p>

Decades of research confirm that creatine monohydrate is effective for increasing lean muscle mass and improving short-burst athletic performance, particularly when combined with resistance training. While newer research explores potential benefits for bone health and brain function, experts say the evidence is still emerging and less conclusive, advising that for most people, the supplement is safe but not a "magic bullet."</p>

As she prepares to face Jessica Pegula in the US Open semi-final, her team hopes her experience and emotional control will help her secure another major championship.</p>

After an initial police raid failed to find the artwork, the family eventually handed over the long-lost canvas to authorities, marking a significant moment for the heirs of the original owner.</p>

Porsche's shares have fallen by more than a third over the past year, leading to its relegation to the mid-cap MDAX index, though the CEO has stated the company aims to return to the DAX as soon as possible.
