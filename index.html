          <p>The partial U.S. government shutdown has reached its 21st day, with ongoing political deadlock over funding for a border wall. President Trump is scheduled to meet with Republican senators at the White House to discuss strategy and potential paths forward. The prolonged shutdown continues to affect federal workers and government services across the country, with no immediate resolution in sight as both sides remain entrenched in their positions. This meeting is seen as a critical step in determining the GOP's next move.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 15:19:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic analysis shows that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, particularly for imported goods like furniture, electronics, and auto parts. Researchers found that companies are passing a substantial portion of these costs on to consumers, leading to measurable upward pressure on prices. While some businesses have absorbed part of the expense, the overall impact is a multi-billion dollar cost to U.S. companies and households, affecting both corporate earnings and consumer spending power.

          <p>A White House official has confirmed there are no plans for a meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin in the immediate future, officially shelving talks that were expected to occur in Hungary.

The decision comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to address the war in Ukraine, where the U.S. and Russia maintain significantly different positions on a potential resolution.</p>

Officers responded by firing, striking the man in the elbow, while a U.S. marshal was hit in the hand by a ricochet bullet. Both individuals were hospitalized following the confrontation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels are reportedly set to hire former catcher Kurt Suzuki as their next manager, according to multiple media outlets. Suzuki, who concluded his 16-year playing career with the Angels in 2022, has been serving as a special assistant to the general manager. He will become the franchise's fifth manager since 2018, taking over from Ron Washington, who missed a significant portion of the 2025 season while recovering from heart surgery. The team is seeking to reverse a decade-long streak of losing seasons.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed softening its landmark anti-deforestation law, which was designed to ban imports of goods like coffee, soy, and palm oil linked to deforestation. The proposed amendments would delay the implementation deadline for large companies and reduce some paperwork requirements, following pressure from major trading partners who argued the original rules were too burdensome. Environmental groups have criticized the move as a step backward, while businesses may see it as a welcome reprieve from stringent compliance measures.</p>

Fischer argued that government intervention in the market would undermine local producers at a time when they are already facing significant economic challenges.</p>
