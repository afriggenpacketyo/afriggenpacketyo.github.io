          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that the company's $30 billion investment in the UK's AI sector, part of a larger "Tech Prosperity Deal" with the US, could boost the UK economy by 10% within five years. The deal involves investments from Google and Nvidia in British-based infrastructure, particularly data centers, and Microsoft's involvement in a new supercomputer in Essex. Nadella emphasized the potential of AI to drive economic and GDP growth, comparing it to the impact of the personal computer in the workplace. The UK government anticipates the deal will create skilled jobs and benefit the entire country. Optimism surrounds the economic benefits of AI, balanced with concerns about energy consumption and over-hype. Optimism is tempered by warnings from groups like Foxglove about the UK potentially footing the bill for the power needed for these tech investments. </p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied Erik and Lyle Menendez's petition for a new trial, asserting that the new evidence presented, including a letter from Erik detailing alleged abuse and a declaration from a former boy bandmate of their father claiming sexual assault, was not compelling enough to change the initial decision. The brothers argued they killed their parents in self-defense due to physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. The judge stated that the evidence was not particularly strong and did not add to the allegations already considered by the jury. The Menendez brothers were initially sentenced to life in prison in 1996 and were recently resentenced, making them eligible for parole, which was subsequently denied. The Los Angeles County District Attorney applauded the judge's decision, calling the motion meritless. </p>

          <p>NPR plans to trim over $5 million from its budget without layoffs or major programming changes due to financial uncertainties stemming from congressional defunding of public media. While listener contributions have increased, NPR executives are unsure how long the generosity will last, as many local member stations struggle. NPR CEO Katherine Maher is offering $8 million in relief to stations hardest hit by the cost of paying for NPR's programs. Some local stations argue they need more help, noting numerous layoffs in public media since the defunding. Despite the challenges, NPR is investing in collaborative reporting and seeking new revenue streams. </p>

          <h2>China's Export Strategy Shifts Focus Away from US</h2>

          <p>A recent report indicates that China is pivoting away from the U.S. in its export strategy, with the city of Yiwu, a major wholesale market, seeing a shift in its customer base towards the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This shift is partly due to the U.S.-China trade war and increased tariffs, leading Chinese suppliers to seek more stable markets. While China's exports to the U.S. have dropped, exports to the Middle East, Europe, and Southeast Asia have surged. However, replacing U.S. orders requires more work for less money, as emerging markets offer lower margins. Despite ongoing trade talks, uncertainties and new fees affecting China-made cargo ships arriving in the U.S. are pushing Chinese suppliers to tap into different markets. </p>

          <p>The UK's Access to Work scheme, which provides grants to support disabled people in the workplace, is facing criticism as businesses and disabled employees report significant reductions in funding. Some recipients have had their support slashed, forcing them to shut down businesses or turn down job offers. Campaign groups are calling for urgent action to fix the scheme, citing long processing times and reduced awards. Ministers acknowledge the scheme's importance but cite increasing demand as a challenge. Critics argue that the cuts are setting disabled people and employers up to fail, hindering efforts to increase disability employment. </p>

          <p>Syria is facing its worst drought in 36 years, slashing wheat harvests by 40% and pushing millions to the brink of a food crisis. A UN report estimates Syria will face a wheat shortfall of 2.73 million tonnes this year, impacting over 16 million people. Rainfall has dropped by nearly 70%, crippling 75% of Syria's rain-fed farmland. Families are already selling livestock and reducing daily meals, with rising malnutrition rates among children and pregnant women. International agencies and the government are providing bread subsidies, but long-term stability depends on farmers sustaining production. </p>

          <p>Hong Kong is emerging as a contender to co-host China’s proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, potentially challenging Beijing’s preference for Shanghai. Hong Kong's legal system and independent judiciary could reassure sceptics and invite broader participation. Shanghai boasts more than 1,100 core AI companies and 100,000 AI professionals, alongside robust government backing. Hong Kong's “one country, two systems” framework allows it to straddle Chinese interests while retaining a degree of international credibility, assuaging Western skepticism towards a global AI center. The choice of Hong Kong could reflect a nuanced strategy on Beijing’s part to navigate escalating US-China tech tensions. </p>

          <p>After filing a $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times, Donald Trump vowed to stop the “radical left media” from “destroying” the nation. Trump accused the NYT of spreading “false and defamatory” content about him. The NYT responded that the lawsuit lacks merit and is an attempt to stifle independent reporting. The case is the latest of several multi-billion dollar lawsuits Trump has launched against US media outlets since his return to the White House. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal actions taken by Trump against media organizations. </p>

          <p>A Norfolk man, Dan Cooper, brought his sexual assaulter to justice 20 years after the incident, inspired by serving on a jury in 2018. Shaun Gilder was sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of two counts of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration. Cooper, who was 17 at the time of the attack, reported the incident to the police but did not proceed further due to being unwell and not being open about his sexual orientation. He re-reported the attack in 2018 and the case proceeded to trial. Cooper has since started making videos about his experience on social media, helping others. </p>

Monarez will testify about a contentious meeting with HHS Secretary Robert F.

One member has lost "millions of euros" as a result, and others lack clarity on a consistent process for accessing the minerals. China controls over 69% of rare earth mine production and nearly half of the world's reserves. Beijing has leveraged this control in trade talks, demanding proof that rare earths will not be used for military purposes. European businesses are concerned about a rare earths shortage, adding to challenges for international businesses amid trade tensions. </p>

          <p>A landlord in London sold one of her properties ahead of the new Renters' Rights Bill, citing concerns about the changes. The bill aims to ban Section 21 "no-fault" evictions, give tenants greater rights to challenge rent increases, and make it illegal to discriminate against tenants on benefits. The landlord believes some of the changes are needed, but is concerned that the bill will ultimately push rents up. The Property Franchise Group has seen a decrease in the number of rental homes they manage, while data shows fewer new lettings properties coming to the London market. The bill is expected to level the playing field by providing tenants with greater security and rights. </p>

These events offer a chance to learn who is in charge of each unit, as the PLA does not regularly announce personnel changes. In 2019, 89 generals were announced as they led 59 formations, including the commanders of China’s five theatre commands.
