          <p>A suicide bomber detonated explosives inside the Mar Elias Church in Dweil'a, Syria, during Sunday Mass, resulting in at least 13 deaths and numerous injuries. The attack, the first of its kind in Syria in years, occurred as the Syrian government attempts to gain support from minority groups. The Syrian Interior Ministry stated that an extremist from the Islamic State group carried out the attack, firing at people before detonating an explosives vest. Church Bishop Moussa Khoury reported that the attacker also threw a grenade into the church during the service, while witnesses described the chaotic scene and the response of security forces and first responders. The incident underscores the ongoing security challenges and the presence of extremist elements in the war-torn country.</p>

          <p>Dental professionals emphasize that tooth loss is not an inevitable part of aging and offer several essential tips for maintaining oral health. Protecting gum health is crucial, as gum disease can lead to tooth loss and contribute to other health issues like dementia, heart attack, and stroke. Experts recommend preventing dry mouth by staying hydrated and using dry mouth rinses, as well as personalizing dental visits based on individual needs. Financial assistance options and adopting healthy habits, such as quitting smoking and limiting sugary treats, are also important for preventing tooth loss, while cosmetic dentistry can restore appearance and confidence.</p>

Himes cautioned against premature celebration of the strikes' success, drawing parallels to past U.S. military interventions in the Middle East. He noted that initial successes in conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan were followed by long-term costs and challenges, advising a measured perspective on the situation with Iran.</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, husband of Belarus' opposition leader, has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump to advocate for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus. Tikhanovsky was unexpectedly freed after five years in solitary confinement and reunited with his wife in Lithuania. He described his harsh prison conditions and called for the freedom of over 1,000 political prisoners still detained. His release coincided with a visit by U.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg to Minsk, marking a rare high-profile American visit.</p>

          <p>Parents know all too well what it's like to deal with a kid who refuses to listen: It's frustrating. But after years of studying over 200 parent-child relationships, I've noticed something fascinating: Parents who rarely deal with defiance don't make threats, bribes or harsh consequences. They use language that makes children actually want to cooperate. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, activating the part of the brain focused on survival rather than learning. But when we shift to language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, cooperation becomes natural.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that certain phrases can instantly make children refuse to listen, with traditional parenting phrases triggering a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead of threats or bribes, parents should use language that fosters cooperation and respects a child's autonomy. Phrases to avoid include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." The alternative approach involves explaining decisions, giving children agency, and validating their emotions.</p>

Its closure would likely mean rising fuel costs for global consumers, including Americans.

          <p>Code-named Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities was the largest strike using B2 bombers in history. The mission involved the first use of Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOP) bombs, capable of penetrating 200 feet deep. The operation included seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers launched from the continental United States, along with decoy bombers, refueling tankers, fighter escorts, and drones. Prior to the mission, Israeli forces had spent about 10 days crippling Iran's air-defense capabilities, destroying much of its fighter aircraft and leaving the country's military airfields severely damaged.</p>
