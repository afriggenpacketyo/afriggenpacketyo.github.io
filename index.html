          <p>Ike Turner Jr., the Grammy-winning son of music legends Ike and Tina Turner, has passed away at the age of 67 from kidney failure. A talented musician, producer, and sound engineer, he was introduced to the music business by his father at a young age and later ran Bolic Sound Studios.

          <p>Mobile advertising firm AppLovin saw its stock price plummet after reports emerged of an SEC investigation into its data-collection practices. The probe is reportedly in response to a whistleblower complaint and several short-seller reports alleging the company violates app store terms by extracting user data without consent for targeted ads. While the company's AI-driven ad technology has led to massive stock growth and its inclusion in the S&P 500, it now faces regulatory scrutiny. AppLovin has stated it is cooperating with regulators in the ordinary course of business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New video footage shows Jihad Al-Shamie, the man responsible for a terror attack at a Manchester synagogue, shortly before he drove his car into worshippers on Yom Kippur, killing two men. The attack resulted in the deaths of Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, with the latter believed to have been hit by police gunfire as officers neutralized the attacker. Al-Shamie, who was on bail for a sexual assault charge, was confronted by security before returning in his car to carry out the attack. Four other individuals have been detained on terror offenses as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have initiated legal action to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops to the city. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues the move is an unconstitutional military occupation intended as a political tool against leadership that has fallen out of the president's favor. Governor JB Pritzker labeled the planned deployment an "invasion," asserting it would sow chaos and mistrust. The lawsuit cites the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits using the military for civilian law enforcement, as a key legal basis for the challenge.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing federal government shutdown, political leaders from both parties have resorted to using internet memes to assign blame and score points on social media. This digital conflict features AI-generated videos, crudely edited images, and partisan insults, replacing traditional political discourse as hundreds of thousands of federal employees go without pay. Critics find the trend disturbing and a sad substitute for governance, arguing that the low-effort jokes fail to address the real-world consequences of the shutdown. The article suggests this meme war exacerbates divisions while abdicating the essential work of running the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is beginning a new term with several cases that could significantly redefine the limits of presidential authority under the Trump administration. A key issue is the president's attempt to deploy state National Guard units to cities against the wishes of local officials, a matter already facing lower court challenges. The docket also includes cases concerning the president's power to fire members of independent agencies like the Federal Reserve Board and to unilaterally impose tariffs. Legal experts anticipate these rulings will test the court's consistency and could fundamentally reshape the balance of power within the federal government.</p>

While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher or equal returns on some short-term timelines, their variable rates are expected to fall with future Fed cuts. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed rate, guaranteeing a specific return over their term, which provides stability in a declining rate environment.

The incident, which occurred outside a hotel, left a 69-year-old truck driver with what prosecutors described as “significant and very severe” injuries. According to an affidavit, the dispute began over parking, leading to Sanchez allegedly assaulting the man, who then used pepper spray and a knife in self-defense.

          <p>For homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), recent and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are making large credit lines more affordable. A $150,000 HELOC currently costs between approximately $1,424 and $1,811 per month, depending on the repayment term, which is significantly lower than a year ago. Because HELOCs have variable rates, their costs will likely decrease further with future Fed cuts, making them an attractive option for tapping into home equity. However, homeowners must ensure they can manage payments, as the rate can fluctuate over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

Goldman Sachs economists noted this date as a key "forcing event," though they acknowledge the stalemate remains deeply entrenched.

          <p>The National Weather Service has upgraded a deadly tornado that struck Enderlin, North Dakota, on June 20 to an EF-5, the highest possible rating. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in the United States in 12 years, with estimated wind speeds exceeding 210 mph. The storm, which was initially rated as an EF-3, killed three people and carved a 12-mile path of destruction. It caused extensive damage, tipping over loaded train cars and completely sweeping away the foundation of a farm building. The last confirmed EF-5 tornado in the U.S. occurred in Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing anti-government protests over power and water shortages, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has appointed army General Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo as the new prime minister. The appointment comes a week after the president dissolved the previous government in an attempt to quell the unrest. Protesters, inspired by similar youth-led movements in other countries, have been on the streets for three weeks, with many now demanding the president's resignation. President Rajoelina stated the country needed a leader capable of restoring order and trust, with Zafisambo's top priority being the restoration of essential utilities.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, reportedly bypassed standard ethics procedures when making criminal referrals against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and other political opponents. According to sources, Pulte sent his accusations of mortgage fraud directly to the Justice Department, circumventing his agency's own inspector general, who would normally handle such matters to ensure impartiality. Legal experts argue this move violates federal regulations designed to prevent the abuse of power for partisan purposes. The direct appeal is part of a broader administration effort to seek criminal charges against perceived political adversaries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property. This means the outstanding mortgage balance should not exceed about half of the home's appraised value. While the FHA, which backs the most common type of reverse mortgage, does not set a specific percentage, this range is the industry standard. The actual amount a senior can borrow is further determined by their age, current interest rates, and federal lending limits, not just their total equity. Homeowners who fall short of the equity requirement may need to pay down their mortgage or consider other options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, upholding her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. The court declined to hear the case without comment, exhausting a major legal avenue for the former British socialite who was convicted for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 for facilitating Epstein's abuse scheme between 1994 and 2004. Her legal team expressed deep disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other options, leaving a presidential pardon as one of the few remaining possibilities for her release.</p>

The British Medical Association (BMA) union reports that thousands of doctors are unable to secure training posts after their second year, with only 10,000 jobs available for 30,000 candidates this year. The union blames poor workforce planning, where medical school enrollment has expanded without a corresponding increase in NHS training capacity.
