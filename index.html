          <p>House Republican leaders blocked Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's bipartisan discharge petition to allow proxy voting for new parent lawmakers.  This unprecedented move, despite 218 signatures, stems from Speaker Mike Johnson's belief that proxy voting is unconstitutional and sets a dangerous precedent. Luna, who had a child while serving, argues the measure is crucial for working parents in Congress. The vote could potentially paralyze House legislative action.</p>
