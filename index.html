          <p>A BBC Africa Eye investigation has identified members of Kenya's security forces responsible for shooting dead anti-tax protesters outside parliament last June, revealing that the victims were unarmed and posed no threat. The investigation analyzed over 5,000 images and videos to trace the fatal shots back to specific officers, including a plain-clothes officer who was heard urging colleagues to "kill". Despite a parliamentary committee ordering an investigation, no report has been issued and no one has been held accountable, prompting public outcry. The protests, driven by young people mobilized on social media, targeted a controversial finance bill, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries.</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturers are facing production pauses and exploring alternative markets due to the impact of increased U.S. tariffs, leading to job losses in key export hubs like Yiwu and Dongguan. The surge in tariffs has disrupted businesses, particularly small enterprises, forcing them to consider new sales strategies such as domestic livestreaming and seeking suppliers outside China. Major Chinese tech companies are supporting exporters by helping them redirect goods to the domestic market through e-commerce platforms and AI tools. However, challenges remain in adapting products for the Chinese consumer market and overcoming increased competition among Chinese companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The election was triggered by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation in January and rising calls for a vote amid trade tensions with the U.S. The main contenders are the Liberals, led by Carney, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, and the New Democrats, led by Jagmeet Singh. Polls indicate a close race, with the Liberals recently gaining ground due to concerns over President Trump's economic policies.</p>
