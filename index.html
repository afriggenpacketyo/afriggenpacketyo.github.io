          <p>Iran is now under severe international sanctions, including on weapons, oil, and banking, due to the snapback mechanism of the 2015 nuclear deal. The UK, France, and Germany triggered this after accusing Iran of non-compliance, despite US withdrawal in 2018. Analysts predict a "suffocating embargo" causing currency collapse, job losses, and inflation, disproportionately affecting the middle class. Diplomatic avenues appear narrow as Iranian leaders dismiss talks, prioritizing their ideological base over potential national destruction.</p>

Indian policy circles are now questioning the US's reliability as a strategic partner, fearing a shift in the Indo-Pacific balance and potential impacts on alliances like the Quad.

          <p>This article details the 14 instances of US government shutdowns since 1980, providing historical context as Congress faces another potential lapse in federal funding. It explains that shutdowns occur when funding for federal agencies isn't approved, a practice formalized by legal opinions in the early 1980s. The piece highlights recurring issues like budget disagreements, the longest shutdown (34 days in 2018), and the increasing frequency of such threats in recent decades. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the 2018 shutdown caused $3 billion in permanent losses.</p>
