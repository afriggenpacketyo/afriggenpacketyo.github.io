          <p>BYD's shares experienced a significant drop following the company's announcement of price reductions on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price cuts, aimed at boosting sales until the end of June, include a 20% reduction on the Seagull hatchback and a 34% cut on the Seal dual-motor hybrid sedan. Citi analysts anticipate a substantial increase in dealership foot traffic as a result of these price adjustments. However, the price cuts have also sparked concerns among investors regarding potential price wars and increased competition within the Chinese electric vehicle market, leading to declines in shares of other automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motor, Li Auto, and Xpeng (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Octopus Energy has issued an apology to a Hartlebury man after pursuing him for nearly four years over an incorrect gas bill amounting to over Â£6,000. Peter Holden, 67, was repeatedly chased by debt collectors despite alerting the company to the error, which stemmed from a shared meter serial number in industry data. Octopus Energy's commercial director, Mario Lupori, personally apologized to Mr. Holden and committed to providing additional staff training to prevent similar mistakes. The company confirmed that Mr. Holden's credit score was not affected and that his personal details were not shared, but the situation caused considerable stress and frustration for the customer.</p>

One strike targeted a school in Gaza City housing displaced families, resulting in numerous casualties, including children, with many bodies severely burned. The Israeli military stated the targeted area was a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control center, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. Another strike hit a home in central Gaza City, killing four more people, as part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in the northern part of the enclave over the past week.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the notion of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has passed away at the age of 97. The film, released in 1969, featured interviews with residents of Clermont-Ferrand, revealing complex and often uncomfortable truths about collaboration and resistance. Initially banned from French television, the documentary sparked controversy but also garnered critical acclaim, paving the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls also directed "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," which won an Academy Award.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to voice their concern regarding "unilateral tariff measures," a likely reference to the United States, at their meeting in Malaysia. The leaders warn that these tariffs pose significant challenges to ASEAN's economic growth and stability, reaffirming their commitment to a non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. In addition to tariffs, the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, following a coup in February 2021, is a key topic of discussion. ASEAN is also addressing the need for humanitarian assistance for Myanmar, which was hit by a devastating earthquake earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Businesses are finding a way to minimize the impact of tariffs by utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing costs by stripping out the middleman's profit. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales, carried out at arm's length by independent parties, with proof that the item was destined for the U.S. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention under recent tariff regimes, particularly in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Venezuelaâ€™s electoral council, which is aligned with NicolÃ¡s Maduro, has declared a resounding victory for his party in regional and legislative elections, although the polls were boycotted by opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado. Despite reports of sparsely populated polling places, the council claimed a turnout of over 40 percent, a figure that could not be independently verified. The results give Maduroâ€™s alliance control of 22 of 23 state governorships, further consolidating power. This election follows a presidential election last year where Maduro claimed victory despite credible evidence of having lost to his opponent.</p>

          <p>Despite increasing condemnation and outrage from international leaders regarding Israel's actions in Gaza, little has changed on the ground, according to Nesrine Malik. The shift in tone from leaders in the UK and EU is noted, with rhetoric now describing Israel's actions as "morally unjustifiable" and "wholly disportionate." However, international censure has been ineffective, with international organizations and courts of justice rendered powerless to translate findings into action. The article suggests that the gulf between Israel's actions and the world's reaction remains too wide to be proportional, and stronger measures are needed to deter further escalation.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep is essential for the brain to clean up harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, discovered that hydrogen peroxide (Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough not only solves a long-standing mystery of why sleep is biologically essential but also opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

She draws parallels between the divisiveness of the Civil War era and current national crises, urging citizens to uphold the legacy of those who fought to preserve democracy.

With the economy struggling, politicians are wary of alienating young men who feel they are victims of reverse discrimination.
