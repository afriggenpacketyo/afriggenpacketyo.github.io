          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls, a critically endangered species native to Mexico City, can thrive in restored wetland environments. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into two aquatic locations, observing that they gained weight and demonstrated hunting and predator avoidance skills. This success is significant because captive animals often lose essential survival behaviors. The findings suggest that reintroduction efforts in suitable habitats can aid in the species' comeback, highlighting the importance of preserving these culturally and scientifically valuable amphibians. The ability of axolotls to survive in man-made habitats also provides hope for mitigating the effects of habitat degradation and climate change on this unique species.</p>

          <p>This Guardian article analyzes Donald Trump's recent posts on Truth Social, noting their increasingly bizarre nature. The posts are categorized into attacks on perceived foes, reposts of praise, and no-context images or videos.

He also posts seemingly random content, such as travel updates and golf videos. The article suggests that these posts offer insights into Trump's mentality and communication style, characterizing them as unhinged and erratic. The article also notes the lack of reach of Truth Social, and how important announcements may be missed by the general public as a result.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article argues that universities, particularly research universities, play a vital role in the pursuit of knowledge and truth, deserving special standing within First Amendment jurisprudence. The author contends that universities are essential to a good society, embodying the values of reason, objectivity, and scientific experiment. They emphasize the unique qualities of universities, such as the scholarly temperament and commitment to open inquiry. The author proposes that universities should be seen as vital to society as the press, acting as a check on government and the public itself. The article also notes the importance of universities remaining independent from government control and interference, even in times of rising authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is facing challenges in staffing after offering employees deferred resignations with pay and benefits through September. Immediately after the departure of many employees, APHIS announced internal lateral transfer opportunities to fill 73 critical positions, including scientists, budget analysts, and inspectors. This move has angered employees who accepted the resignation offer out of fear of layoffs, as the agency is now effectively paying two salaries for the same roles. The USDA declined to comment on the rationale behind this decision, stating it aims to optimize and reduce the workforce while maintaining critical services.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), a teaching union, is taking legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The union is challenging the introduction of new school report cards, arguing they represent another crude grading system. NAHT's general secretary, Paul Whiteman, has requested that the plans be scrapped. Ofsted maintains that the new system supports mental health, but the union's legal claims are deemed untenable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 25% tariff on key auto parts, including engines, dealing another blow to Japan's car industry. This action follows the imposition of the same tariff rate on automobiles.

The auto industry has been a major driver of the broader economy, and the tariff could have a huge impact on Japan.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, has injured nearly 50 people, including an 11-year-old child, officials reported. The attack involved seventeen drones and targeted civilian infrastructure, residential buildings, houses, and shops. Mayor Oleg Synegubov described the attack as "massive," causing fires and significant damage across four districts of the city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating they targeted homes and not military sites. This incident occurred ahead of Russia's planned three-day ceasefire for its World War II holiday, which Zelenskyy dismissed as insincere.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent agreement with the United States, Ukraine will struggle to compete with China as a major supplier of critical minerals needed for high-tech industries. Most of Ukraineâ€™s mineral reserves are in Russian-occupied territories, and extracting and processing the remaining resources will take years. China controls about 60% of the world's rare earth reserves and processes approximately 90% of them. Analysts suggest that American companies will continue to face challenges in sourcing these materials as Beijing restricts its supply amid ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>York Outer MP Luke Charters is advocating for a review of the legislation banning alcohol consumption in view of the pitch at English football stadiums. Charters believes that the 1985 ban, originally intended to curb hooliganism, needs a modern approach. He suggests limited trials to assess the impact of lifting restrictions, noting that other sports and countries allow alcohol consumption in stadiums. The Football Supporters Association (FSA) supports the call for trials and a broader conversation about the issue.</p>
