          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a "fantasist" and convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who orchestrated an elaborate plan for a non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. Kenny falsely claimed the event would feature major acts like The Killers and be backed by prominent investors, deceiving employees, suppliers, and even government bodies. The scheme unraveled when payments failed to materialize and documents, including an invoice from a train company, were flagged as potential forgeries. The article details how Kenny's grandiose promises misled many in the industry, leaving them unpaid and questioning his motives.</p>

          <p>The United States swim team is contending with an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore, affecting several athletes.

          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning to reform licensing rules to shield pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and processes for new businesses would be streamlined. This initiative aims to revitalize the struggling hospitality sector, reverse the trend of pub closures, and support outdoor dining and drinking. While the Labour government touts the changes as cutting red tape, the Conservative opposition has criticized the move as hypocritical given other economic pressures on the industry.</p>

While the policy targets key sectors like agriculture and manufacturing and could create millions of jobs, it faces significant hurdles. Economists point to the need for substantial funding, estimated at around $4 billion, and challenges related to infrastructure, such as reliable power, and securing private sector buy-in.

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become a stand-up comedy sensation by telling jokes about her abusive ex-husband and patriarchal norms. Her performances, which mix humor with poignant social commentary, have resonated deeply with audiences but have also attracted negative attention from some authorities. An official statement from Zhejiang province, without naming her, warned that such jokes "provoke" gender conflict, reflecting the Chinese government's sensitivity towards feminist discourse. Fan's rise highlights both a growing appetite for discussing taboo social issues and the official unease with such conversations.</p>

          <p>Four people, including a husband and wife, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. Authorities allege the children, aged 7 to 16, were subjected to horrific treatment, including being kept in plywood cages under bunk beds. The adopted children in the home were reportedly treated worse than the biological children, beaten with canes, and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. The investigation began after a legally mandated reporter from a local church raised concerns about potential abuse, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Official's Remarks on Ancient Kingdoms Rekindle Historical Sensitivities with South Korea</h2>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has reignited a sensitive historical dispute with South Korea by calling for a clearer presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms from a Chinese perspective. The party chief, Huang Qiang, referred to the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms, which are known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae and are central to Korean historical identity. This contested history, concerning kingdoms that existed in what is now northeastern China and the Korean peninsula, has long been a point of contention. The official's comments risk straining diplomatic ties by reasserting a narrative that South Korea views as a distortion of its heritage.</p>

          <p>An update from South Korean investigators into the fatal Jeju Air crash suggests the plane could have continued flying on its damaged but still-working engine. The Boeing 737-800 crashed during an emergency landing after a bird strike, killing all but two of the 181 people aboard. According to the update, the crew shut down the less-damaged left engine, while the more heavily damaged right engine was still generating sufficient output for flight. The investigation has not yet concluded, but this information raises questions about the crew's actions in the moments leading up to the belly-landing that ended in a fireball.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has intensified its efforts to control information about mass attacks, such as those involving vehicles or knives, leading to public pushback online. In recent months, news reports and social media posts about such incidents have been quickly scrubbed from the internet, and official statements have become increasingly vague, often omitting key details. This clampdown on what the Communist Party deems sensitive news appears to have escalated since a particularly deadly attack in November. Some citizens are now complaining online, demanding more transparency from authorities.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival, civilian-led government, a move that significantly escalates the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent division of the nation. This development formalizes the split in the country, with the army controlling the north and east while the RSF holds most of Darfur and other regions. UN officials have warned this could further fragment Sudan and undermine diplomatic peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has reportedly intervened in the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, making phone calls to both nations' leaders to press for an immediate ceasefire. Both countries thanked him for his efforts, with Cambodia agreeing to the ceasefire and Thailand expressing willingness while stressing the need for dialogue first. Despite the diplomatic overtures, shelling reportedly continued along the border. The intervention comes just before U.S. tariffs on both countries are set to take effect, with Trump stating that trade talks cannot resume until the fighting stops.</p>
