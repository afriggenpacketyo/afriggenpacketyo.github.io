            <p>Joe Kasper, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s chief of staff, is transitioning to a special projects role at the Pentagon amidst broader staff changes. This move follows the departure of three close advisers to Hegseth due to media leak allegations, which they deny. John Ullyot, another senior staffer, resigned citing “total chaos” within the Pentagon. The changes reflect internal turmoil and potential instability within the Defense Department under the Trump administration, as Hegseth attempts to advance the 'America First' agenda.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has initiated a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration in response to proposed budget cuts amounting to billions of dollars. The lawsuit is a direct result of escalating tensions between the university and the administration, particularly after Harvard rejected demands to alter its diversity initiatives and address antisemitism. President Trump's actions include freezing $2 billion in federal funding and threatening the university's tax-exempt status. Harvard's president, Alan M.

Russia is close to regaining control of the western region of Kursk and controls nearly all of Luhansk and more than 70 per cent of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Ukraine is a complete loser. The article suggests that China could step in to fill the void left by the US, potentially mediating between Russia and Ukraine and helping to stabilize the region.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to address immigration concerns at the US southern border. This law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel for law-enforcement duties within the US, including the National Guard. Trump's administration is assessing the necessity of this measure, despite border crossings reaching a quarter-century low. The Insurrection Act has been used sparingly in American history, including during the Civil War and the Los Angeles riots in 1992.</p>

            <h2>Is Credit Card Debt Consolidation a Smart Move Now?</h2>

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating debt may be a good idea for many. Consolidating high-rate credit card debt into a personal loan with a lower interest rate can result in significant savings over time. The effectiveness of debt consolidation largely depends on your credit profile; those with good to excellent credit may qualify for the lowest consolidation loan rates. Debt consolidation can simplify payments, but it's crucial to address any underlying spending issues. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Stocks fell sharply on Monday following President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his call to lower interest rates. The Dow is down more than 800 points, with the S&P and NASDAQ also experiencing significant declines. The price of treasuries and the value of the dollar, which typically rise in times of market turmoil, are also lower. Trump stated that there is virtually no inflation and that the economy could slow down unless Powell lowers interest rates immediately.</p>

            <p>The U.S. dollar has fallen to a three-year low as investors retreat from U.S. assets amid tensions between President Trump and the Federal Reserve. Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and suggestions of his potential removal have further dented investor confidence. Analysts suggest that the market is signaling disapproval of potential interference with the Fed's independence, leading to a loss of confidence in U.S. economic policy making. This has resulted in global investors pulling capital out of the U.S.</p>
