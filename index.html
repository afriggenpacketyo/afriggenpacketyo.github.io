          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, frequently describing it as "uncertain" and "struggling." Persistently high prices are the primary driver of this sentiment, with two-thirds of respondents stating prices are still rising and expecting them to continue to do so. These perceptions are influencing personal financial outlooks, particularly for those with lower incomes, and are tinged with partisan differences. Overall, a majority believe the economy is worsening, with about a quarter anticipating a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence company OpenAI is significantly increasing the size of its secondary share sale, offering eligible current and former employees the chance to sell stock worth approximately $10.3 billion. This is a substantial increase from the initial target of $6 billion and values the company at $500 billion, a notable rise from its previous $300 billion valuation. The transaction, set to close in October, includes participation from major investors like SoftBank and Thrive Capital.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten years after Germany's welcoming stance during the 2015 migrant crisis, Europe's approach to migration has shifted dramatically towards stricter controls and border security. Concerns over security, economic strain, and the rise of far-right political parties have led many nations, including historically welcoming ones like Sweden, to adopt more restrictive policies. Countries like Hungary have implemented tough measures, facing EU fines but feeling vindicated as other nations follow suit. This has created a paradox where borders are tightened for asylum seekers while labor shortages persist, all while humanitarian crises continue for those attempting to reach Europe.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident occurred in Lisbon, Portugal, when a historic funicular streetcar, the Elevador da Glória, derailed and crashed. The incident resulted in at least 15 deaths and 18 injuries, with five individuals reported to be in serious condition. Eyewitnesses reported the car careened uncontrollably down a steep hill, and authorities are currently investigating the cause of the crash. The city has declared a three-day period of mourning in response to the event, which is being called the worst in its recent history.</p>

          <p>More than a thousand current and former employees of the Department of Health and Human Services have signed an open letter demanding the resignation or firing of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The letter accuses Kennedy of "endangering the nation's health" through actions such as the recent firing of the CDC director and elevating vaccine skeptics to key posts. This call for removal comes amid significant turmoil at the agency, with staff citing layoffs and politically motivated changes to public health policy. An HHS spokesperson defended Kennedy's actions, stating he is working to restore trust in a broken system.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University was illegal. The court determined the action was retaliatory, stemming from the university's refusal to comply with administration demands for policy changes related to governance and diversity programs. Judge Allison Burroughs noted that the administration's sudden focus on antisemitism as a pretext for the freeze was arbitrary, as the decision was made before any investigation into the issue on campus. The ruling vacates the funding freeze and bars its enforcement.</p>

          <p>Macy's stock price jumped by 20% after the retailer announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations and raised its financial guidance for the full year. The company reported its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, attributing the positive trend to strategic renovations in key stores and strong performance in categories like denim and women's apparel. CEO Tony Spring expressed cautious optimism, noting that while tariff impacts are a reality, the company is well-positioned to gain market share. The strong results signal a potential turnaround after the company had previously slashed its outlook.</p>

          <p>The number of job openings in the U.S. declined in July to 7.18 million, a level not seen since the economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This figure was below economists' expectations and represents the lowest reading since September 2024, fueling concerns that the labor market is weakening. The data point is being interpreted by some economists as a "turning point" and another "crack" in the job market. This report increases the focus on upcoming weekly jobless claims and the monthly jobs report for further insight into the economy's health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new all-time high of around $3,549 per ounce, marking a roughly 42% increase from a year ago. This spike is driven by investor demand for gold as a "fear hedge" amid global uncertainty, trade tensions, and concerns over U.S. debt. For consumers who purchased items like the 1-ounce gold bars sold at Costco, this represents a significant unrealized gain. However, the article notes that actual profits upon selling would be reduced by dealer fees and taxes, as the IRS classifies physical gold as a collectible taxed at a higher rate.

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have discovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, an ankylosaur from over 165 million years ago, revealing a creature with extraordinary body armor. The dinosaur, roughly the size of a small car, possessed long neck spikes, large spikes over its hips, and a feature never seen before: ribs with spikes fused directly to the bone. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting they developed complex armor much earlier than believed. Scientists speculate the elaborate spikes were used for both defense against predators and for attracting mates.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, a judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing evidence can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This is the first time such cutting-edge forensic technology, which can analyze degraded and rootless hair samples, will be admissible in a New York State court. Prosecutors used the method to link Heuermann and his family members to hair strands found on the remains of multiple victims. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, but the decision is seen as a major victory for the prosecution.</p>

This plan follows a recent Trump administration rule change that loosened experience requirements for these temporary judicial roles.

          <p>Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, the war in Ukraine is likely to continue for a significant time due to fundamental, unresolved conflicts between the two nations' core demands. Russia insists on territorial concessions and political neutrality from Ukraine, which Kyiv cannot accept, while Ukraine's need for robust, long-term security guarantees is a non-starter for Moscow. Russia's larger capacity for a war of attrition and President Putin's belief that the conflict is existential for Russia give him an incentive to prolong the fighting. This dynamic creates a stalemate where negotiations continue without yielding a clear path to a lasting peace.</p>

Newsmax claims these anticompetitive behaviors have hindered its own growth, distribution, and advertising revenue. A Fox News spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own "competitive failures," while Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy asserted the days of Fox's alleged tactics are over.</p>

This new provision, part of a recent tax bill, allows qualifying workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income annually from 2025 through 2028. The list is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and aims to provide clarity on who qualifies for the tax break, which was a key campaign promise.

Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have labeled the situation as "corruption," arguing it provides a direct avenue for those seeking to influence the president to enrich him personally.
