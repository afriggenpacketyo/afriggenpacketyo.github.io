          <p>A 21-year-old Brooklyn man with a history of protest-related arrests has been charged with arson for allegedly setting fire to 11 New York City police vehicles. The incident, which occurred in a private NYPD lot in Bushwick, caused an estimated $800,000 in damages. Surveillance footage and fingerprint evidence from a lighter and sunglasses found at the scene reportedly link the suspect to the crime. His attorney described him as an activist, and he has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.</p>

          <p>A case in London has detailed the brutal murders of Albert Alfonso and Paul Longworth by Yostin Mosquera, a man they knew through a transactional relationship involving extreme sexual content. The court heard that Mosquera, a Colombian national, killed the two men in their flat, dismembered their bodies, and attempted to dispose of them in Bristol. The investigation uncovered a complex history of payments from Alfonso to Mosquera for explicit videos, which prosecutors argued was the motive for the killings. Mosquera was found guilty of the double murder and awaits sentencing.</p>

          <p>Actor and director Malcolm-Jamal Warner, widely known for his role as Theo Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show,' has died at the age of 54.

Warner's career extended well beyond the iconic sitcom, including roles in 'Malcolm & Eddie' and 'The Resident,' as well as directing and music, earning a Grammy in 2015. Friends and colleagues remembered him as a humble, kind, and talented artist who was a devoted family man.</p>

          <p>The historic Ryde Hotel in the California Delta is mourning the apparent theft of a large portion of its resident peacock flock. After a guest witnessed men forcing a peacock into a cage, a headcount revealed that only four of the several dozen birds remained on the grounds. The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident as a felony, with the estimated value of the birds being thousands of dollars. Hotel staff are concerned the peacocks may have been stolen for illegal activities, and are grieving the loss of the birds, who were local icons.</p>

          <p>National Archives documents have revealed that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing while at 10 Downing Street. Between 2001 and 2002, Mrs. Blair reportedly paid just £31,000 for clothes worth over £75,000, with the discounts arranged by her personal shopper. The files show that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception and whether these benefits needed to be declared under a new ministerial code. They advised the Blairs to repay some of the discount, though it is unclear if this occurred.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by property portal Zoopla suggests the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has risen by £221 over the past three years, a 21% increase. This surge is attributed to high demand and a shortage of available rental properties, putting significant financial pressure on tenants. The report notes that while the rate of increase is now slowing, some renters are being forced to turn down job opportunities or move due to unaffordable housing costs. The rise in rental costs is comparable to the increase in monthly mortgage payments for homeowners over the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has sparked controversy over a key detail from the cockpit voice recorder. Seconds after takeoff, both fuel-control switches were moved to 'cut-off,' causing a total loss of engine power. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he initiated the cut-off, with the other denying it, though it's unclear who said what. This has led to widespread speculation about pilot action, while Indian and US investigators have urged caution, stating that drawing conclusions is premature and irresponsible while the full investigation is ongoing.</p>

This decision lifts a temporary block on the policy, putting thousands of individuals who fled war and instability at risk of deportation.

The accusations come after the administration's handling of the Epstein files angered some of his own supporters. Figures like Rev.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—dubbing them 'PARC.' He suggests these companies are being relentlessly driven up by excitement from retail investors, creating a separate track from the broader S&P 500 market. Cramer noted that while these stocks may experience pullbacks, their momentum is likely to continue as long as a wave of new IPOs doesn't create a supply glut. He advised that while there is money to be made, investors should exercise discipline and take profits on significant gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:01:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth's rotation has been speeding up, leading to marginally shorter days and raising a novel issue for global timekeeping. This acceleration, caused by factors like the moon's gravity and changes in the planet's liquid core, could eventually require the unprecedented step of removing a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This 'negative leap second' has never been implemented and raises concerns about its potential to disrupt computer systems, satellites, and telecommunications. Interestingly, scientists note that the effect is being partially counteracted by melting polar ice, which slightly slows the planet's spin.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis examines how President Trump is increasingly using the judicial system to push his policy goals, a strategy bolstered by recent Supreme Court rulings that have expanded presidential immunity and curbed lower courts' power. The administration has launched a 'full-frontal onslaught' against federal district judges who have blocked its agenda, particularly on immigration, questioning their legitimacy and authority. This has led to an unprecedented level of hostility and threats against the judiciary, raising fundamental questions about the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches in the U.S.</p>

The sentence comes despite a controversial recommendation from the Trump administration's Justice Department for only one day in prison, a position the judge rejected. Taylor's family expressed that while the sentence was not what they hoped for, it was a 'small piece of justice' and a statement against the DOJ's recommendation.</p>
