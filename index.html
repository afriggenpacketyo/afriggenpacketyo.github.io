          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has slightly lowered its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast but still anticipates above-normal activity, with a 50% chance of such a season. The updated outlook predicts 13 to 18 named storms, of which five to nine could become hurricanes, including two to five major ones. Forecasters attribute the active season to factors like warm ocean temperatures and a neutral El Niño phase. Officials urge communities in storm-prone areas to use this forecast as a call to action for preparedness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new U.S. census that does not count undocumented immigrants, an announcement he made via social media. This new survey would be based on information from the 2024 presidential election. The move represents a significant shift in how the decennial census is conducted, which is constitutionally mandated to count all persons and is used to allocate congressional seats and federal funding. This follows a previous, unsuccessful attempt by the administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.</p>

The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and a 3.4% sales growth at Tim Hortons. Burger King saw modest growth, with its U.S. turnaround efforts continuing, while Popeyes lagged with a 1.4% decline in same-store sales amid increased competition in the fast-food chicken market.

          <p>A group of congressional Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, is asking the Trump administration to prevent employees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from transitioning into permanent career positions. In a letter to federal personnel and budget offices, the lawmakers expressed alarm that these political appointees are embedding themselves across agencies, which they argue could sabotage government functions and violate civil service laws. The Office of Personnel Management director refuted the claims, stating that no individuals have been unlawfully hired and that all appointments comply with merit system principles.</p>

          <p>This article posits that a societal decline in politeness, particularly in online interactions, is negatively affecting individual happiness and mental health. The author defines politeness as a key component of the 'agreeableness' personality trait and cites research showing that being courteous to others can increase one's own happiness and reduce anger. The essay suggests that individuals can counteract this trend by making courtesy a habit, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity, thereby improving their own well-being and exercising personal freedom.</p>

While the cut will provide relief to some mortgage holders, it may lead to lower returns for savers, and the narrow vote suggests future rate reductions are uncertain.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative overview of key financial tools for seniors, examining how annuities, reverse mortgages, and Social Security can be used to generate retirement income. It frames Social Security as a foundational income source, while annuities offer a guaranteed lifetime payment stream akin to a personal pension. Reverse mortgages are presented as an option for house-rich, cash-poor seniors to access home equity without selling. The piece concludes that a blended approach is often the most effective strategy.

          <p>Eli Lilly reported that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, achieved an average weight loss of nearly 12% in a late-stage trial. While the results pave the way for a new needle-free alternative in the booming weight-loss drug market, they were slightly below some Wall Street expectations, causing the company's stock to decline. The data also showed that about a quarter of patients on the highest dose discontinued treatment for various reasons, including gastrointestinal side effects, tempering some of the enthusiasm.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are expressing alarm and dismay over what they characterize as a sustained, multi-pronged effort by the Trump administration to exert political control and cut funding for scientific research. This includes freezing outside grants and targeting specific areas like cancer and HIV research. An anonymous senior NIH official stated that the administration is attempting to destroy American scientific research, creating extreme uncertainty and threatening the careers of scientists both inside and outside the government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global oil market is largely shrugging off President Trump's threats to place heavy secondary tariffs on countries like India and China for purchasing Russian oil. Analysts suggest that traders view the threats as a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy, believing the administration will avoid any action that could significantly increase energy prices. This market skepticism is reinforced by the administration's past reluctance to fully enforce energy sanctions, such as those on Iran, leading to a belief that a deal will be reached.</p>

          <p>Australian cricket great Glenn McGrath has upheld his long-standing tradition by predicting a 5-0 whitewash victory for Australia in the 2025-26 Ashes series against England. While acknowledging potential weaknesses in Australia's batting, McGrath expressed strong confidence in the home team's dominant bowling attack. England has struggled in Australia, having not won a Test match there since their victorious 2010-11 tour, a trend McGrath expects to continue despite admiring England's aggressive style of play under coach Brendon McCullum.</p>

          <p>Peloton reported an unexpected profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, but simultaneously announced plans to lay off 6% of its global team to achieve further cost savings. The positive earnings were attributed to better-than-expected sales and significant expense reductions.

The mixed news, balancing profitability with job cuts, signals the company's ongoing and challenging business transformation.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent tariff policy, suggesting that a more coherent strategy has emerged, one that uses the threat of steep tariffs as leverage to force bilateral trade concessions from other countries. While this tactic has resulted in some agreements, the overall policy remains fraught with significant risk. The administration faces serious legal challenges to its authority to impose these tariffs, and there are growing concerns that the economic impact could slow growth or even trigger a recession.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign an executive order that will direct the Labor Department to review guidance on allowing alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies, within 401(k) plans. This move would represent a major victory for the alternative asset industry and could significantly change retirement planning for many Americans. It would open mainstream, tax-advantaged retirement accounts to investments that are traditionally considered higher-risk and have been largely limited to pension funds and endowments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the complex stance of some American labor unions, like the UAW, which have offered support for President Trump's tariffs. For decades, these unions have opposed free-trade agreements such as NAFTA, which they hold responsible for the decline of U.S. manufacturing jobs, and thus view protectionist tariffs as a potential solution. This support is complicated, however, as economists warn that broad, untargeted tariffs could ultimately harm the working-class communities the unions aim to protect by damaging the overall economy.</p>
