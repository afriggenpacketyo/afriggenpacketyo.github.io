          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one death and two injuries. The victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare, and authorities have arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, charging him with second-degree murder. The incident, which occurred near a wedding reception in an adjacent room, appears to be random as there is no known connection between the suspect and the victims.</p>

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that children develop strong social skills not from memorizing polite phrases, but from observing their parents' behavior. The research highlights nine key practices, including openly discussing emotions, modeling empathy, fostering authentic confidence, and teaching conflict resolution. According to the article, creating an environment of emotional safety and connection at home is crucial for raising socially aware and emotionally intelligent children.</p>

It traces the legal battle led by NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall, which successfully overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established by the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision. While the landmark ruling did not immediately end segregation, it marked a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement and significantly advanced the nation toward its founding ideals of equality.</p>
