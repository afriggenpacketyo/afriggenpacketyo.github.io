          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, attributed to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. Experts emphasize that high food price inflation and the consumption of processed foods contribute to the problem, especially among children. The Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, but critics argue it stigmatizes overweight people and overlooks economic struggles. Experts advocate for a nationwide free school meal program and stricter regulations on unhealthy food marketing to address the issue effectively.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's (FA) ban on transgender women playing in women's football has come into effect, preventing 28 registered transgender women from participating in FA-affiliated leagues. This decision follows the UK Supreme Court's ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex. Billie Sky, a transgender woman who helped her team earn promotion, is now unable to play with them, and while she can still play informally for Goal Diggers FC, the club withdrew from all FA-affiliated leagues in response to the policy. Some grassroots footballers support the ban, citing the protection of the integrity of women's football.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's aggressive yet weak approach to China is increasing the risk of war with Taiwan. Trump's punitive tariffs and discriminatory curbs on technology transfers are seen as provocative, potentially pushing Xi Jinping to take drastic action. The author suggests that Trump's policies are driven by self-interest and fear, leading China to believe the US will not defend Taiwan. The article concludes that Trump's chaotic foreign policy and disruption of alliances create a vulnerable situation that China may exploit.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to the Penal Code, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons over strict punishment, marking the first change to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer categorized by labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education. The revised law introduces 24 tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for the elderly and those with addiction issues. Inmates will be sent to prisons offering appropriate programs, with their situation reviewed every six months.</p>

          <p>South Korean women who played a key role in protests leading to the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol now feel invisible as gender equality is largely ignored by current presidential candidates. The two main candidates have been silent about women's equality, while a third candidate with anti-feminist views gains popularity among young men. Many young South Korean women feel their voices are being erased, despite their efforts to improve the world through anti-Yoon rallies. The candidates' silence on gender equality highlights the ongoing struggle for women's rights in South Korea.</p>
