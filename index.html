          <p>In this New York Times article, Brendan Buck argues that congressional Republicans are relying on a spending and tax cut package to revive their political fortunes amidst President Trump's economic policies, particularly tariffs. The proposed bill includes extending the 2017 tax law, but Buck suggests that this may not be enough to counteract the economic damage caused by Trump's tariffs. He points out that voters may not reward Republicans for the tax bill, especially if they also cut Medicaid, and that congressional leaders need to pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policies. Buck suggests that without a stable economic footing, Republicans face a difficult path to re-election.</p>

          <p>German companies operating in China are experiencing economic challenges due to the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, primarily through indirect effects on the Chinese economy. A survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that Washingtonâ€™s tariffs on Chinese goods have had the most significant impact on its members. However, the 'in China for China' strategy, where firms focus on serving Chinese consumers rather than exporting, has helped to insulate them from direct trade disruptions. This localization strategy has proven beneficial in mitigating the adverse effects of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are considering cutting provider taxes on hospitals to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts, a move that could significantly impact Medicaid funding. These taxes, used by nearly every state, help cover Medicaid costs and draw additional federal dollars, benefiting hospitals and low-income individuals. Critics argue that these taxes reduce accountability and incentives for states to control Medicaid spending, while supporters say they are essential for maintaining adequate payments to providers and supporting rural hospitals. The potential elimination of these taxes has sparked concern among hospitals and state officials, who fear it would harm their ability to provide care and maintain essential services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is likely to maintain current interest rates due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs could lead to increased inflation and slower economic growth. Despite pressure from the president to lower rates, the Fed is expected to keep its benchmark borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. Trump's recent tariffs on imports have raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and rising prices, potentially creating a dilemma for the Fed between controlling inflation and supporting job growth. The Fed's decision will depend on how tariffs impact both inflation and unemployment rates in the coming months.</p>

Lake claims this move will save taxpayer money and provide reliable news options, but current and former Voice of America staffers express concern that OAN's pro-Trump bias would compromise the network's credibility.

          <h2>Catholic Church Threatens Excommunication Over Washington State Law on Child Abuse Reporting</h2>

          <p>The Catholic Church has announced that priests will face excommunication if they comply with a new Washington state law requiring clergy to report confessions of child abuse to law enforcement. The Archdiocese of Seattle emphasized the sanctity of confession and the Church's commitment to protecting it. The new law does not provide an exception for information revealed during confession, leading to a conflict with the Church's canon law. The U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has opened an investigation into the law, citing potential violations of First Amendment religious protections.</p>

          <p>The increasing commercialization of soccer, driven in part by American investment in European clubs, is now leading to potential conflicts as foreign leagues look to tap into the U.S. market. With competitions like the Premier League and La Liga considering staging games in the United States, Major League Soccer (MLS) faces the challenge of protecting its domestic market. American investors, who have acquired numerous European clubs, are now seeing those teams and others eyeing the lucrative U.S. market, potentially impacting the growth and revenue of MLS. The situation sets up a reckoning between American investors with interests in European soccer and those focused on the domestic game.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed that the opportunity for Russia to participate in the 2026 World Cup could serve as an incentive for the country to end its war in Ukraine. Currently, Russia's national football team is banned from international competitions by FIFA and UEFA due to the invasion. Trump, who has previously campaigned on ending the war in Ukraine, suggests that allowing Russia to play in the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, could encourage a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU), has been elected chancellor of Germany after a second round of voting in parliament.

          <p>Under a new bill to be introduced in Parliament, criminals in England and Wales who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to prevent offenders from 'opting out' of justice and ensure they face the consequences of their actions. The bill was prompted by cases where killers refused to attend their sentencing, causing further distress to victims' families. The new measures would apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are disruptive and removed from the courtroom.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, China's central bank cut interest rates and made it easier for banks to increase lending in response to the trade war with the United States. The central bank, the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China, cut short-term interest rates and the amount of funds banks have to hold in reserve in a series of 10 measures. This announcement, billed as policies to stabilize markets, came shortly after Washington and Beijing announced that top officials from the Trump administration will meet with Chinese counterparts this week during a trip to Geneva. This will mark the first formal meeting about trade between the two countries since President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent almost a month ago.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a National Insurance (NI) exemption in the newly-agreed trade deal with India, amidst claims that it could disadvantage British workers. The deal extends an exemption on national insurance contributions from one to three years for people on short-term visas. Opposition parties argue this could make Indian workers cheaper to employ, particularly with recent increases in UK employer Nics. The government insists that it would not tolerate any trade agreement that undercuts British workers, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claims she had previously refused a similar trade-off.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a roadmap to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027, but experts warn that new dependencies and old divisions could hinder the plan. While overall EU fossil fuel imports from Russia have decreased since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, imports of Russian LNG have risen. The plan proposes banning new gas contracts with Russian suppliers by the end of 2025 and phasing out all remaining imports by 2027. However, divisions among member states and reliance on LNG from other sources, such as the United States, pose challenges to achieving energy independence.</p>
