          <p>Artificial intelligence software provider Palantir announced quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time, a milestone reached earlier than analysts predicted. The company's revenue grew 48% year-over-year, leading to a significant rally in its stock price. Citing strong performance and a 140% increase in total contract value, Palantir has raised its full-year revenue and profit guidance. CEO Alex Karp also highlighted a goal to increase revenue tenfold while reducing the company's overall headcount, underscoring a focus on operational efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives has voted to authorize law enforcement to civilly arrest Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a quorum.

Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the Department of Public Safety to locate the absent Democrats, though the arrest warrants are not enforceable outside of Texas. The Democratic lawmakers are holding events in other states to draw national attention to the issue.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as director general of the British security service MI5, has passed away at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, a period of significant transformation that included taking lead responsibility for countering Irish republican terrorism and increasing public transparency. Her appointment marked the first time the head of MI5 was publicly identified, and she is widely credited with inspiring Dame Judi Dench's portrayal of 'M' in the James Bond films. After retiring, she became a successful author of spy novels.</p>

McDonald was a fugitive for years before his arrest in Florida in 2024. Prosecutors stated that he betrayed the trust of his victims in a scheme that defrauded them of millions.</p>

          <p>A new report from the nonprofit Circulate San Diego argues that extensive third-party permitting requirements are a primary cause of delays and budget increases for major transit projects in California, including the high-speed rail. These regulations, originally intended to prevent unchecked infrastructure development from harming communities, have now created significant bureaucratic obstacles. The article highlights how disputes with local jurisdictions and agencies can stall projects for years.

          <p>Beth Hammack, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, has warned that U.S. consumers could face higher inflation in 2025 as businesses begin passing on tariff-related costs. Many companies had previously absorbed these costs or used stockpiled inventory, but shrinking profit margins are now forcing price increases. Hammack noted a 'two-speed economy,' where high-income earners are thriving while lower-income households struggle with rising costs for essentials. The situation presents a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which must balance controlling inflation with addressing a slowing labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report, which showed the creation of only 73,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, has intensified fears of a significant economic slowdown.

Economists now see elevated risks of a recession, citing pressure from tariffs on consumer spending and business investment.

          <p>New scientific research proposes an unusual dietary source to explain the exceptionally high nitrogen values consistently found in Neanderthal remains. Scientists have long been puzzled by these nitrogen isotope levels, which are higher than those of other top predators. The new hypothesis suggests that Neanderthals may have consumed meat that was infested with maggots. Because maggots concentrate nitrogen as they feed on decaying flesh, eating them along with the meat would have significantly elevated the nitrogen signatures in Neanderthal bones, offering a new perspective on their dietary habits.</p>

          <p>A communication expert and author outlines nine common phrases that can undermine a person's authority and credibility in professional settings. Phrases like 'I think,' 'Does that make sense?,' and 'Sorry to bother you' can signal doubt and a lack of confidence. The article suggests replacing them with more powerful and direct alternatives, such as 'I recommend,' 'Let me know if you'd like me to clarify,' and leading with a clear purpose. Adopting this action-oriented language can help individuals be taken more seriously and ensure their ideas are not overlooked.</p>

          <h2>Danish Zoo Asks Public to Donate Unwanted Pets to Feed Predators</h2>

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has made a public appeal for people to donate their unwanted but healthy pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, to be used as food for its carnivores. The zoo stated that this practice helps imitate the natural food chain and provides a more natural diet for animals like lions, tigers, and lynx. The donated animals are 'gently euthanised' by trained staff before being fed to the predators. The zoo also accepts horses, offering donors a potential tax deduction, and noted that this has been a common practice for many years.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called for police to release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. His comments came after two men, reported to be Afghan nationals, were charged in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton. Farage argued that a lack of transparency fuels online conspiracy theories and public unrest. Current national policing guidance does not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after they have been charged, a policy intended to avoid prejudicing legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of mystery, scientists have identified the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed billions of the animals along North America's West Coast. A study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution pinpoints the bacterium Vibrio pectinocida as the causative agent. The epidemic has been particularly devastating for the sunflower sea star, a keystone species whose population has plummeted by over 90%, leading to the destruction of kelp forests by unchecked sea urchin populations. This breakthrough could enable targeted conservation efforts, such as developing diagnostic tests and breeding disease-resistant sea stars.</p>

The 12-month program will target travelers from countries with high rates of visa overstays or deficient security screening. While the specific countries have not yet been named, the measure is a response to a Trump administration executive order aimed at curbing illegal immigration.

          <p>Russia's Foreign Ministry summoned the German ambassador to Moscow, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, to protest comments made by a German diplomat in Japan. Moscow accused the diplomat of questioning Russian sovereignty over the southern Kuril Islands, a territory claimed by Japan since the end of World War II. In a protest note, Russia warned Germany against casting doubt on the post-war order. The German embassy rejected the accusation and criticized Russia for its own violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, calling Russian revisionism the central problem in international politics today.</p>

          <p>The Russian Foreign Ministry has announced that Moscow is no longer adhering to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a key Cold War-era nuclear disarmament pact. This formalizes Russia's position years after the United States withdrew from the accord in 2019, citing Russian violations. The 1987 treaty eliminated all land-based missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The move raises concerns about a renewed arms race, as Russia has threatened a 'mirror-like' response to the planned deployment of new U.S. missiles in Europe.</p>

The firm also cited increased competition from decentralized finance platforms and potential regulatory delays as significant risks. Coinbase, the only crypto-related stock in the S&P 500, reported total revenue of $1.5 billion for the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the political tactic of 'breaking quorum,' recently used by Texas Democrats to block a Republican redistricting plan. The move, which involves lawmakers leaving the state to deny the legislature the minimum number of members required to conduct business, is described as a 'nuclear option' for minority parties. While it can effectively delay legislation and draw national attention, its long-term success is often limited, as governors can call repeated special sessions. The tactic has been used in other states like Oregon and Minnesota with mixed results, reflecting growing partisan polarization.</p>

The new award is contingent on Musk staying in a top executive role for two more years and will only be paid if the original package is not reinstated on appeal.
