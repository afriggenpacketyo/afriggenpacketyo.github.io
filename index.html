          <p>Amidst rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, wealthy mainland Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their real estate investments to markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. This shift marks a significant change from 2023, when the US was the top choice for Chinese buyers of homes priced above US$5 million. Property agents attribute this trend to geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals, leading buyers to seek friendlier alternatives. The article notes a more than 50% drop in Chinese investment in US homes since its peak in 2017.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise and marking a victory for school choice advocates. The program allows parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, with families receiving $10,000 per year, or up to $30,000 for children with disabilities. While supporters argue it expands educational options for families, critics contend it will drain resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. Texas joins over 30 other states with similar programs, establishing the largest voucher program in the nation.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a fundamental shift in his approach to governance, moving from a coalition-based administration to a royal court structure characterized by loyalists and enforcers. Klein posits that Trump's first term was marked by tension between his disinhibition and the moderating influences of his staff and the Republican Party. However, the choice of Vance, who openly supported overturning the 2020 election, indicates that Trump's second term will be defined by a lack of concessions and a focus on prioritizing loyalty over dissent, effectively removing the guardrails that tempered his most extreme impulses in his first term.</p>

The piece criticizes the UN's failing system, the reduction in overseas aid, and the inability of international courts to sanction states effectively, contributing to a sense of global breakdown.

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is posing a significant challenge to the established Labour and Conservative parties in Britain, highlighted by recent gains in local elections. The article suggests that this surge in support for Reform, along with other smaller parties, is indicative of a breakdown in traditional party loyalties and a fragmentation of the political landscape. With both Labour and the Conservatives struggling to maintain their grip on power, the rise of Reform has energized supporters and potentially altered the dynamics of British politics. The success of smaller parties also underscores the changing mood of public disenchantment and the challenge the main parties face in competing with opponents on both the left and right.</p>

          <p>Taiwan’s Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, is facing a deepening crisis as it attempts to unseat leader William Lai Ching-te amid a surge in recall petitions targeting its lawmakers. The KMT, known for its pro-Beijing stance, is dealing with increased recall efforts led by supporters of Lai and allegations of document forgery in counter-recall campaigns. The situation has led to raids on KMT local chapter headquarters and mounting criticism from Taiwan-centric civic groups who accuse the party of obstructing the Lai administration. The future relevance of the KMT as a functioning opposition is now being questioned.</p>

Japan is the only country that mandates couples to adopt the same surname upon marriage, and the survey estimates that over a million people would consider marriage if separate surnames were an option.</p>
