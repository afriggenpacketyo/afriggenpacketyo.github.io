          <p>Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky met at St. Peter's Basilica during Pope Francis' funeral, marking their first face-to-face encounter since February amid escalating tensions over the Ukraine conflict. Trump previously accused Zelensky of jeopardizing global stability by resisting Washington-led ceasefire plans, which reportedly involve territorial concessions to Russia, including Crimea. While Zelensky has consistently rejected such proposals, he indicated a willingness to discuss terms following a complete ceasefire. The White House characterized the 15-minute meeting as "very productive," with plans for a follow-up discussion later that day, although seating arrangements during the funeral kept the leaders apart.</p>

          <p>Ten students at Occidental College initiated a hunger strike to protest the college's investments in weapons manufacturers with ties to Israel and to advocate for increased protections for international students facing visa revocations. Inspired by a similar campaign at Chapman University, the students are demanding that Occidental divest from companies providing arms and equipment to the Israeli military. They are also requesting pro bono legal support for international students at risk of losing their visas and the expungement of protest-related conduct charges from student records. College President Tom Stritikus acknowledged the students' concerns, noting that the college has already taken steps to support international students, but emphasized the college's disagreement with the hunger strike as a tactic.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles due to a nearly $1-billion budget deficit and the rapid depletion of the city's reserve fund. The downgrade reflects concerns about the city's weakening financial position and an emerging structural imbalance, which could lead to higher borrowing costs for the city. While Mayor Karen Bass acknowledged the expected downgrade, she emphasized the steps being taken to balance the budget and implement structural reforms. S&P indicated that further downgrades could occur if the city does not promptly address its budget management.</p>

His visit marks the first by a potential Democratic presidential hopeful to an early primary state since the November elections. While Pritzker remains focused on a possible third term as governor, his trip to New Hampshire is seen as an early audition for a national campaign.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena-based lighting company, Nila, is facing uncertainty due to President Trump's new trade policies, including tariffs on Chinese goods. The tariffs will affect the cost of imported components used in Nila's specialized LED lights, impacting projects for stadiums, the U.S. Senate recording studio, and various government facilities. The owner, Jim Sanfilippo, is concerned about the impact on his business and the difficulty of planning amidst the uncertainty. He is considering strategies such as increasing international sales and potentially moving manufacturing to Mexico to mitigate the effects of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the importance of truth in combating tyranny, drawing parallels from vampire movies where the first step in defeating the creatures is convincing people of their existence. The piece argues that freedom of speech, rather than the right to bear arms, is the primary defense against tyrannical governments. The author contends that the unwillingness to believe the truth, rather than a lack of access to it, has historically hindered progress. The piece concludes by emphasizing that truth, while not requiring public acknowledgment to exist, needs people willing to speak it to be effective in the battle against evil.</p>

Despite its proximity and potential as a tourist attraction, the waterfall is currently inaccessible due to private land ownership and bureaucratic hurdles. Visitors are forced to trespass along active train tracks, leading to safety concerns and near-miss incidents with trains. City officials are working to negotiate with landowners and the Union Pacific Railroad to build a safe hiking trail, but progress has been slow and costly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant increase in cocaine use, with the drug becoming more prevalent across all social classes, according to experts. Factors contributing to this surge include a saturated market in North America, leading drug traffickers to concentrate on Europe, and a decline in heroin availability due to the Taliban's ban on opium cultivation in Afghanistan. The accessibility of cocaine through messenger services and its relatively low cost have also contributed to its increased popularity. This rise in cocaine use poses serious health risks, including heart attacks, strokes, and long-term psychological effects, and presents challenges for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, is leading Canada's Liberal Party into a federal election after becoming prime minister following a crisis sparked by President Trump. Trump's threats against Canada created a situation that Carney, known for his economic expertise, was well-suited to address. Carney's leadership and management of economic turmoil position him as a key figure in the election. He is vying for a full term in the top political job in his country of birth after decades of high-profile work in the public and private sectors around the world.</p>

          <p>World leaders and royals, including Donald Trump, Prince William, Emmanuel Macron, and Volodymyr Zelensky, attended Pope Francis' funeral at the Vatican. The event brought together figures from around the globe at a time of fragile international diplomacy. Trump and Zelensky, who have recently been in negotiations and public disagreements, were seated relatively close to each other. The seating arrangements placed dignitaries in a separate section from the general public, with prominent figures like Javier Milei and Italian leaders given prime positions.</p>

          <p>Despite Canada warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and experiencing record-breaking wildfires, climate change is not a top issue for voters in the upcoming election. Instead, the focus is on choosing a leader who can stand up to President Trump, who has threatened Canada with a trade war or annexation. The dominance of Trump-related issues has overshadowed concerns about climate change, shifting the election's priorities.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced a third round of negotiations regarding Tehran's nuclear activities, raising hopes for a new agreement to prevent further conflict in the Middle East. President Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal, noting that he had abandoned a previous nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018. The talks aim to reduce the risk of a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A successful accord could also ease American sanctions and attract foreign investors, potentially transforming Iran's economic and political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies are inadvertently benefiting Vladimir Putin's interests, from pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to weakening U.S. institutions. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine appears one-sided, allowing Russia to retain regions taken by force and preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Additionally, Trump's actions on other fronts, such as creating rifts with traditional allies and altering the U.S. government, align with Moscow's objectives. These actions, whether intentional or not, are strengthening Russia's position on the global stage.</p>

          <p>As Canada's election nears, polls indicate a tightening race between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. While Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party maintains a lead, the gap has narrowed, suggesting a potentially close outcome. Despite the tightening polls, analysts believe the Liberal Party remains poised to win due to the distribution of votes across the country. A tied national vote would probably still translate to a Liberal victory in terms of seats in the House of Commons, allowing them to form a government and giving Mr. Carney a full term as prime minister.</p>

The fact that Bessent found it necessary to address these concerns underscored the growing unease about the dollar's global standing and the potential consequences if the international community loses faith in U.S. assets.</p>
