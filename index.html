          <h2>SK Hynix Reports Record Q2 Profit and Revenue, Exceeding Market Estimates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 19:42:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing analyst predictions. This success is largely driven by sustained, high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative artificial intelligence. The company has solidified its position as a global leader in HBM, supplying major clients like Nvidia and outperforming rivals such as Samsung Electronics in the DRAM market. Analysts anticipate SK Hynix will maintain its market dominance in this sector through the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea successfully avoided a technical recession as its economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, outperforming economists' expectations. This growth marks a positive reversal from the previous quarter's contraction, fueled by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. The data also showed a rise in total consumption, driven by government spending on healthcare and private spending on vehicles and recreation. The nation is currently in critical trade negotiations with the U.S. to avoid potential tariffs that could impact its export-driven economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tesla's Automotive Revenue Declines for Second Consecutive Quarter Amid Sales Miss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 19:33:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported a 16% drop in automotive revenue for the second quarter, with overall sales falling for the second straight quarter and missing analysts' estimates. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the company could face a few challenging quarters, citing impacts from higher tariff costs and the upcoming expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits. The company's performance has been partly attributed to consumer backlash following Musk's political activities. Despite the slump, Tesla is moving forward with plans for a more affordable model and continues to emphasize its long-term vision focused on robotaxis and humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

He advised investors to remain skeptical but not cynical, acknowledging that while there are risks, there are also significant opportunities for profit in the current landscape.

The "History Under Construction" exhibit, which used sticky notes to add context about Indigenous peoples and women to an existing timeline, has had these additions removed. The project's creators intended to provide a more complete and complex historical narrative, including difficult truths about figures like John Muir.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's public pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a dangerous power play aimed at subordinating the central bank to political needs. The author contends that while Powell's performance has been flawed, forcing the Fed to lower interest rates to accommodate government borrowing is a hallmark of failed monetary systems that leads to inflation and instability. The piece asserts that the core issue is not monetary policy but rampant federal spending and exploding debt. The solution is fiscal restraint, not political manipulation of the Federal Reserve.

          <p>IBM shares dropped in extended trading after the company reported second-quarter software revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations. Although overall earnings and revenue topped projections, the slight miss in the key software segment raised investor concerns. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients were moving cautiously due to geopolitical tensions and that U.S. federal spending was constrained in the first half of the year. Despite the software results, the company's consulting and infrastructure units performed well, and IBM reiterated its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow.

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled its AI Action Plan, a new blueprint designed to ensure the United States wins the global artificial intelligence race against competitors like China. The plan advocates for loosening environmental rules to speed up the construction of data centers and expanding the export of U.S. AI technologies. In a speech, President Trump declared that America would win the AI competition and called for a single federal standard for regulation rather than a patchwork of state laws. The initiative also aims to prevent government business with tech companies whose AI systems exhibit what the administration calls ideological bias.</p>

Gabbard corrected Collins on a technical point about intelligence committees, while Leavitt defended the DNI, stating the president has the utmost confidence in her.

          <p>A search warrant reveals that bomb squad technicians believed the grenades that exploded and killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's detectives were inert. The detectives had responded to a call about grenades found in a storage unit and, after an initial X-ray, transported them to a training academy for disposal. The following day, at least one of the devices detonated, causing the deadliest incident for the department in over 150 years. The ongoing investigation by the sheriff's department and the ATF is seeking to determine how the detonation occurred and if proper protocols were followed during the handling of the explosives.</p>

          <p>The globally recognized word "OK" has a uniquely American origin, starting as a joke in the 1830s and popularized by a presidential campaign. Scholars trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839 as a playful, misspelled abbreviation of "all correct" ("oll korrect"). The term gained widespread use during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently aligned with the abbreviation, leading to the formation of "O.K. Clubs." From this political beginning, the simple and versatile word spread worldwide, becoming a universal term for agreement and understanding.</p>
