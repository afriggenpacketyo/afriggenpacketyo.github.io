          <p>Japan's birth rate has fallen below 700,000 for the first time, signaling a deepening demographic crisis. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reports a 5.7% decrease in births from the previous year, with a record-low fertility rate of 1.15. Despite a slight increase in marriages, the natural population decrease reached a postwar high. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research had not projected such low birth rates until 2039, underscoring the accelerating pace of decline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics, however, warn that this could harm steel producers outside the US and spark retaliatory measures from trade partners. The UK has been granted a temporary carve-out from the increased tariffs, maintaining duties at 25%. The move has prompted concerns about rising prices and potential disruptions to global trade.</p>

Documents suggest that patients suffered avoidable harm, and death certificates failed to disclose that the procedure contributed to their deaths.
