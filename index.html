          <p>President Trump is under fire for hosting a black-tie gala for top investors in his meme coin, $TRUMP, an event critics are calling a blatant pay-for-play scheme. Over 200 cryptocurrency traders, many from overseas, invested heavily in the coin to gain access to the exclusive dinner and a potential VIP tour. Critics argue that Trump is improperly profiting from his position, with funds potentially flowing directly into his family's coffers. While some investors see it as an opportunity to network and influence policy, data suggests that most $TRUMP investors have lost money, while Trump and his partners have made millions in transaction fees.

          <p>This New York Times article reports that President Trump's claims of genocide against white farmers in South Africa have been met with anger, disbelief, and humor by Black South Africans. Many feel that after living through decades of apartheid, it is infuriating to see Afrikaners, the white descendants of colonizers, portrayed as victims. The article highlights how Black South Africans are using humor to cope with the grinding poverty and violent crime that many still endure. Despite President Ramaphosa's attempts to address his country's economic issues, Trump continued to make false claims, undermining the seriousness of their meeting.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully revived a set of roll thrusters on Voyager 1 that had been inactive for two decades. This reactivation is crucial because the spacecraft's primary thrusters are showing signs of clogging, potentially failing as early as Fall 2025. These smaller thrusters ensure Voyager's antenna remains aligned with Earth, maintaining communication. While Deep Space Station 43, the antenna used to communicate with Voyager, is undergoing upgrades, the team will be unable to communicate with the probes until February 2026, highlighting the importance of these upgrades for future Moon missions.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by agreeing to donate $50,000 to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, a local organization for underprivileged youth. The city initially sued Smollett for reimbursement of the $130,000 cost of investigating his claims of a racist and homophobic hate crime, which police determined to be a hoax. Smollett's conviction was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court on double jeopardy grounds, and he maintained the attack was real in a countersuit against the city.

The provision is included in a domestic policy bill and aims to block federal judges from enforcing contempt citations if they haven't previously ordered a bond from those suing.

While a lower court had ordered the restoration of workers and operations, the appeals court has allowed Lake to continue slashing the ranks.
