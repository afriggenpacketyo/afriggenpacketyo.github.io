          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is engaging with world leaders and diplomats. However, rather than seeking de-escalation, India appears to be building a case for potential military action against Pakistan, accusing it of having ties to the attack. Despite denying involvement, Pakistan faces increasing pressure as India cites past patterns of support for terrorist groups and ongoing investigations linking the perpetrators to Pakistan, raising tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece highlights Turkey's slide toward autocracy under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, citing constitutional changes, judicial control, and suppression of media and dissent. The recent detention of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, along with his associates on questionable charges, marks a significant escalation. The author criticizes the muted response from world leaders, arguing that democracies should do more to support the Turkish people and pressure Erdogan to uphold democratic principles, given Turkey's strategic importance and the erosion of its republic's foundations.</p>

          <p>Faced with an unaffordable housing crisis, Australian politicians are considering capping the number of international students as a potential solution, marking a significant shift for a country that has long relied on international education as a major export.
