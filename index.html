          <p>A shooting occurred at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, on Sunday morning, resulting in one injury and the death of the suspect. According to police, the suspect, a 31-year-old man, recklessly drove to the church and began firing a long gun and handgun at the building. A parishioner struck the suspect with their vehicle, and two staff members, including a security guard, shot and killed him. One staff member was shot in the leg and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, while authorities are investigating the motive behind the shooting, which involved approximately 150 people present during the service. The FBI is assisting with the investigation.</p>

          <p>China has voiced strong criticism of the United States and Israel, urging them to de-escalate their conflict with Iran and prioritize the safety of civilians. China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, stated that Washington's actions have violated Iranian sovereignty and exacerbated tensions in the Middle East. Fu Cong called on the international community to uphold justice and make efforts to restore peace and stability. The statement came during an emergency UN Security Council meeting where geopolitical divisions were evident, with China and Russia defending Iran, while the US and its allies defended Israel.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of US strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, world leaders have reacted with a mix of condemnation and calls for de-escalation. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran reserves all options in responding to the attack, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's decision. China condemned the US attack and called for a ceasefire, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a dangerous escalation. The EU urged all sides to return to negotiations, and Saudi Arabia expressed great concern, while reactions from other countries including the UK, Russia, Japan, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, and Australia also conveyed similar concerns and appeals for peace.</p>

          <p>Six people have died and two remain missing after a 27-foot boat capsized on Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is receiving renewed attention as Japan approaches its first giant panda-free period in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Tokyo. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits to Japan as tourist attractions. Experts speculate that China will likely loan new pandas to Japan, possibly during a high-level visit, especially after agreeing to resume importing Japanese marine products. However, historical and territorial disputes, along with political factors like the pro-Taiwan mayor of Shirahama, could complicate matters.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge has ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a focal point in President Trump's immigration policies, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges. However, it is expected that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will take Abrego Garcia into custody, potentially deporting him before his trial. The judge acknowledged that determining Abrego Garcia's release is largely academic due to ICE's likely detention, but emphasized his right to the presumption of innocence. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have argued that the smuggling charges are an attempt to justify the deportation mistake, and the case highlights the conflict between criminal charges and immigration enforcement.</p>

The LDP's poor result further strains Ishiba's minority government in national politics.

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda identifies five phrases that parents should avoid using to encourage children to listen. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying, you're fine," often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering communication. Instead, Raouda suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, such as "I know you don't like this decision, I'll explain, and then we're moving forward." By shifting to language that fosters respect and emotional safety, parents can create conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>

Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes but said the attack would not stop Iran from advancing its nuclear program, and Iran has threatened to retaliate against the U.S. if it joined the Israeli offensive.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, the National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States." While there are no current specific threats, the bulletin cautions that low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely. The bulletin notes that U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020, and warns that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could also motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators. The bulletin provides information to the public about threats and resources for staying safe during the heightened threat environment.</p>

          <p>Following the United States' military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, located between Oman and Iran, is a crucial trade passage for millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Iran's control over the northern side of the strait has long been a source of concern. Disruptions to oil flow through the strait could severely impact international energy markets and economies, and the U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>

          <p>New satellite photos show the aftermath of the U.S. military strike on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility and two other key locations in Iran's nuclear program. The stealth U.S. mission, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," struck three nuclear facilities in Iran — Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — and satellite images show damage to the mountainside where the underground nuclear site at Fordo is buried. A layer of ash caused by the airstrikes can be seen across a large swath of the area, and several of the tunnel entrances that lead to the underground facility appear blocked by dirt following the strikes. The United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency has seen "no increase in off-site radiation levels" in the wake of the U.S. strikes.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces told CBS News that Iran had launched about 30 missiles at Israel, and Israel later responded with fighter jet strikes in Iran.

Washington acting alone and choosing to send its planes direct from America meant that a massive, binary decision from the UK wasn't needed.

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This transformation was driven by government subsidies, long-term planning, and a focus on dominating future technologies. The Chinese government spent an estimated $231 billion from 2009 to 2023 developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EV production. The country now has the world's largest public charging network and dominates critical supply chains in battery production. This has resulted in a thriving EV start-up sector and fierce competition, making EVs more affordable for the mass market.</p>

She believes that messaging from pro-abortion groups has created a climate of fear among medical staff, while abortion rights activists argue that the restrictive law itself caused the problem.
