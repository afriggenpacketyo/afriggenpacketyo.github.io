          <p>China and the United States have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns following ministerial-level talks in Geneva.

          <p>Top military officials from India and Pakistan are scheduled to discuss the details of a ceasefire brokered by the US, following recent tensions and hostilities over Kashmir. The ceasefire, announced by President Trump, appears to be holding after several days of intense shelling and aerial incursions. Both nations have ceased hostilities but remain vigilant, warning each other against violating the agreement. The tensions stemmed from a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which led to cross-border strikes and accusations of airspace violations.</p>

          <p>Reports that the Trump administration may accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked ethical concerns, highlighting the long history of U.S. presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers. The U.S. Constitution bans government office holders from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional approval, as outlined in the emoluments clause. Gifts valued over $480 are considered property of the United States and are managed by the White House Gift Unit, often transferred to the National Archives or presidential libraries. The article notes that foreign leaders use gifts to strengthen relationships, but ethical concerns persist regarding potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have announced a trade deal following productive talks in Geneva, although details remain scarce and a joint statement is expected on Monday. The agreement aims to ease tensions that arose after President Trump imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures. While U.S. officials have described the talks as a breakthrough, Chinese officials have been more reserved, framing their involvement as a necessary step to avoid further escalation and protect the global economy. Financial markets have responded positively, but some analysts warn of potential disappointment if tariffs are not significantly reduced.</p>

The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct feasibility studies, as elk are considered a "keystone" species that can enhance biodiversity. Challenges include gaining public acceptance and assessing disease risks to livestock. The successful reintroduction of beavers serves as a potential model for the project, which would initially involve keeping elk in enclosures before potentially releasing them into wetland habitats.</p>

This decision precedes President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The Israeli Prime Minister's office acknowledged the plan but emphasized that preparations for intensified fighting would continue, with the release facilitated by military pressure on Hamas. Alexander, captured during the October 7 attack, is believed to be the last living American hostage held in Gaza, and his release is contingent on a temporary halt to Israeli military activities.

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to Kannon Temple in Japan, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, a cultural asset of Nagasaki Prefecture, was handed over to representatives of the Japanese temple in South Korea. After being stolen, South Korean authorities arrested the thieves, but Buseoksa Temple claimed the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023, leading to the statue's return.</p>

          <p>Diplomats from India and Pakistan view the recent US-brokered ceasefire over Kashmir as a welcome step, but acknowledge that it will take more to address the long-term distrust between the two countries. While the de-escalation marks the end of their worst military confrontation in 25 years, experts believe it will not easily lead to lasting peace. The US mediation provided a useful off-ramp for both nations, with analysts suggesting that the US leveraged IMF conditionalities to hasten the end of hostilities. Despite the ceasefire, issues like terrorism and water security pose long-term challenges.</p>

The White House termed it a "trade deal," but provided few details, promising a joint statement on Monday. The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, aim to de-escalate trade tensions and avert a global recession.</p>

          <p>Immigration into the UK has been a significant social and demographic change in the 21st century, marked by a 30-year trend of more people migrating to the UK than emigrating. Net migration, which was broadly balanced before the mid-1990s, has climbed steadily since 1994. Despite promises from political leaders to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, numbers have remained historically high. Brexit, intended to give the government control over immigration, has not resulted in the anticipated decrease in net migration, underscoring the political challenges in addressing this issue.</p>
