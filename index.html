          <h2>Tankers Show Caution Around Strait of Hormuz After U.S. Attack on Iran Nuclear Sites</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 09:12:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, several tankers initially reversed course away from the Strait of Hormuz due to concerns over potential closure of the vital trade route, but three of the six vessels have since resumed their course towards the Strait. Data suggests a reluctance from shipowners to enter the Middle East Gulf zone immediately after the Israel-Iran conflict, but this trend has partially reversed. While the situation remains fluid, the overall flow of vessels into the region appears to be sustained despite the specific diversion event, and the number of crude carriers signaling intent to enter the Mideast Gulf has recovered. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the uncertainty but also the resilience of trade flows.</p>

          <p>A recent Russian missile and drone attack in the Kyiv region has resulted in the deaths of at least eight people and injuries to many more, according to the interior minister. The attack involved 352 Russian drones and 16 missiles targeting Ukrainian territory, primarily in the Kyiv area, with residential areas, hospitals, and sports infrastructure being hit. Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky vowed to step up Ukrainian strikes on Russia in response to the intensified air attacks against Ukrainian cities. President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet with PM Keir Starmer in London to discuss UK military support for Ukraine amidst stalled diplomatic efforts to end the three-year war. The tragic loss of life indicates a low optimism score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, effectively branding it a terrorist organization after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painted military planes red to protest against the UK's support of Israel during the war in Gaza. Cooper emphasized that this decision is specific to Palestine Action and does not affect lawful protest groups campaigning on issues around Palestine or the Middle East. The announcement followed a protest in central London where hundreds gathered, resulting in arrests as scuffles broke out. The order will be laid before Parliament next week, making membership and support for the group illegal. The optimism score for this event is relatively low given the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Antonio Filosa has stepped into the role of CEO at Stellantis, succeeding Carlos Tavares, who resigned amid disagreements with the company's board. Filosa, who previously served as head of the company's Americas operations, aims to revitalize Stellantis' performance, mend strained relationships with dealers and employees, and manage the transition to electrified models. He faces challenges including sales declines and a drop in net profit, with industry experts noting the need to balance investments between traditional vehicles and electric vehicles. Filosa's appointment is viewed as a logical choice for the automaker as it navigates regulatory uncertainty and global economic concerns. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the challenges ahead but also the potential for improvement under new leadership.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. entered the war between Israel and Iran, China's support for its ally Tehran is likely to be tempered by its limited influence and strategic calculations regarding Washington's involvement. While Beijing has drawn closer to Iran in recent years, its primary economic interest lies in access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz. China's rhetoric has shifted to brokering dialogue and a ceasefire, seeking to contain tensions and prevent spillover of the conflict. Some analysts suggest China may benefit from chaos in the Middle East, posing a distraction to the U.S., but others believe China will discourage Iran from retaliating militarily.

Pompliano likened the rush into bitcoin treasuries to a bubble, emphasizing the underlying trend's strength. ProCap joins a cohort of bitcoin-heavy ventures using reverse mergers and blank-check vehicles to tap into public markets.

          <p>Despite promises to end America’s “forever wars” overseas, Donald Trump has deployed thousands of national guard troops and U.S. marines into Los Angeles in response to protests against his administration’s immigration sweeps.

A group of retired generals and admirals have filed a lawsuit seeking to reverse the deployment, arguing that it violates constitutional limits on government power.
