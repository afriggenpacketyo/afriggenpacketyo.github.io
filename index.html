          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant reduction in its second-quarter operating profit, falling to 4.7 trillion Korean won, largely impacted by a 93.8% profit slump in its semiconductor division. While the company's revenue of 74.6 trillion won slightly exceeded expectations, the sharp profit decline from the previous year's 10.44 trillion won was attributed to memory inventory adjustments and costs from China export restrictions. Despite these headwinds, Samsung projects a future boost from a substantial $16.5 billion chip supply contract, which Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has indicated involves his company. The article highlights Samsung's plan to proactively address growing demand for high-value and AI-driven products in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed actor Alec Baldwin's lawsuit against prosecutors and investigators, which alleged malicious prosecution and civil rights violations stemming from the fatal 2021 "Rust" movie set shooting. The dismissal, made without prejudice, grants Baldwin's legal team 30 days to file for reinstatement, with his lead attorney indicating ongoing settlement discussions. Baldwin's prior involuntary manslaughter charge was dismissed last year amid accusations that police and prosecutors withheld crucial evidence. The article details Baldwin's claims of defamation, asserting he was targeted for professional or political gain following the tragic incident that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.</p>

          <p>Over two dozen protesters, linked to groups like the Southern Wisconsin Grassroots Network, conducted a mock funeral procession, delivering a cardboard coffin and flowers to the private residence of House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil in Wisconsin. The video-recorded event, which included participants dressed in black and carrying cowbells, involved placing the prop at his front door. Congressman Steil denounced these actions as "disappointing" and "radical left tactics," emphasizing his commitment to his work despite perceived threats. This incident, reported to U.S. Capitol Police, underscores a significant 93.8% increase in threats against congressional offices, leading to increased security funding for lawmakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora's Arora Group has unveiled a competing proposal for Heathrow Airport's expansion, presenting an alternative to the airport owners' existing plan. Their "Heathrow West" initiative suggests a shorter 2,800-meter third runway, which critically avoids the expensive and disruptive need to divert the M25 motorway. The Arora Group claims its plan, developed with Bechtel, could be fully operational by 2035 at an estimated cost under £25 billion, a figure notably lower than Heathrow's own escalating projections. This development, prompted by the government's invitation for competitive bids, aims to enhance the UK's global connectivity, despite concerns from groups like the No 3rd Runway Coalition regarding rehoming thousands.</p>

Under the agreement, Trump stated South Korea would commit $350 billion for U.S.-controlled investments and purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, however, interpreted the $350 billion fund as a means to facilitate Korean companies' entry into U.S. industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors, emphasizing mutual benefit.

          <p>Robinhood announced a robust second-quarter performance, exceeding Wall Street estimates with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million and net income more than doubling to $386 million. The financial services platform saw its funded customer base grow by 2.3 million to 26.5 million, while total platform assets nearly doubled to $279 billion due to strong net deposits and rising valuations. Robinhood is actively expanding beyond retail trading into wealth management, notably through its TradePMR acquisition, and is preparing to launch Robinhood Banking this fall. Despite these positive results, shares experienced a slight dip following a warning about increased costs for 2025 due to the Bitstamp acquisition. (not investment advice)</p>

Victims expressed profound re-traumatization and outrage that the perpetrator obtained their names and addresses, with suspicions pointing to his defense lawyers' documents.

          <p>Key U.S. allies, including Canada, France, and the UK, are increasingly diverging from the Trump administration's stance on Gaza's future, with all three announcing plans to recognize a Palestinian state. This diplomatic shift, highlighted at a French-Saudi-led UN conference, contrasts sharply with the U.S. boycott of the meeting and its continued firm support for Israel. The article notes the Trump administration's evolving and unclear vision for post-war Gaza, moving away from earlier proposals of forced displacement.

However, the article highlights that tariffs have paradoxically widened the U.S. goods trade deficit, as firms stockpiled imports, and are now starting to increase U.S. consumer prices on certain goods. China's exports to the U.S. have decreased, but its trade with other partners has grown, suggesting global supply chain shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the key factors that contribute to the formation of tsunamis, particularly focusing on strong earthquakes. Geophysicists note that an earthquake generally needs to be at least magnitude 6.5 to 7 and cause significant vertical motion on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami. Underwater earthquakes or those near shore, especially in areas like the Ring of Fire, increase the likelihood. The article clarifies that tsunamis differ from regular waves, traveling as fast as airplanes in deep ocean with low height, but slowing down and gaining dangerous height in shallow waters. It emphasizes the importance of taking tsunami warnings seriously due to their immense power and potential for debris.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzed the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain steady interest rates, attributing it to an uncertain macroeconomic environment that makes the Fed reluctant to act. Cramer explained that by historical standards, a rate cut seems unreasonable given a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth, despite President Trump's pressure. He noted Chairman Jerome Powell's concerns that tariff-induced inflation, if cut too early, could become persistent. However, Cramer also presented arguments for cuts, citing "intractable" housing prices and potential consumer weakening, concluding that the market was discouraged by the Fed's lack of clear signals for future rate reductions.

          <p>Ford Motor reinstated its full-year guidance, projecting adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, despite an estimated net $2 billion impact from President Donald Trump's auto tariffs. The automaker had previously suspended its guidance due to tariff uncertainties. Ford's CFO noted "near-daily communications" with the Trump administration regarding steel and aluminum tariffs, and observed a 1% price increase in the retail segment. The article highlights Ford's larger U.S. manufacturing footprint helps mitigate tariff impacts compared to rivals, even as its "Model e" electric vehicle business continues to incur losses amid evolving EV policies.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to explain why it has not complied with previous orders to restore Voice of America's (VOA) operations, accusing it of ignoring directives. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth demanded an explanation by August 13 on how the administration plans to utilize the $260 million Congress appropriated for VOA, which has been largely non-operational since March. The article notes that Kari Lake, Trump's appointed adviser, previously stated 85% of VOA employees were laid off as part of an effort to dismantle a "bloated bureaucracy." The judge criticized the administration for "cagey answers" and suggested its actions amounted to "waste."</p>

          <p>An Israeli hostage, Ms. Damari, who was injured and abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023, has strongly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. Damari, whose mother is from London, argued that such a move "risks rewarding terror" and sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy, especially while Hamas still controls Gaza and holds hostages. Her statement, supported by lawyers representing other British hostage families, expresses deep concern that this approach might disincentivize Hamas from releasing captives.

          <p>A legislative act in the U.S. aiming for energy independence is sparking debate over whether the U.S. is ceding leadership in the clean energy transition to China. Supporters argue the act is crucial to mitigate U.S. vulnerability to China's dominance in clean tech manufacturing and critical minerals, which are vital for renewable technologies. Critics contend that prioritizing short-term security and economic gains over long-term sustainability could hinder U.S. competitiveness and threaten global climate goals. The article highlights a strategic divergence where China appears poised to win the renewables race while the U.S. shifts focus towards fossil fuels and nuclear energy. (not investment advice)</p>
