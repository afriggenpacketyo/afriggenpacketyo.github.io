          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has been in contact with world leaders, seemingly building a case for potential military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of involvement in the attack. Modi promised severe punishment for those responsible, hinting at the razing of terror safe havens. Security forces from both sides have engaged in intermittent small-arms fire across the border, heightening tensions, while Indian forces have initiated a clampdown in Kashmir, arresting hundreds in search of the perpetrators of the attack. The situation remains volatile as India contemplates its response. Optimism score: 10</p>
