        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has stalled in the House of Representatives due to Republican budgetary divisions, exposing the party's internal disagreements over the extent of spending cuts. The bill's tax breaks total approximately $4.9 trillion, offset by cuts to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks. Some conservative congressmen are demanding steeper cuts to avoid increasing the national debt, while others oppose cuts to Medicaid, warning of the impact on lower-income constituents. State and local tax deductions also remain a point of contention, with lawmakers from high-tax states arguing that the proposed cap is insufficient.</p>

          <p>Teachers at Westbourne Academy in Ipswich are on strike due to disruptive student behavior, including students throwing objects and roaming the halls. Teachers report a lack of consistent disciplinary action and support from the senior leadership team, leading to mental health struggles and resignations. Social media and mobile phones are seen as contributing factors to the poor behavior, with students losing motivation to work hard. Parents have mixed reactions, with some supporting the strike and others criticizing the disruption to their children's education.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a UK/EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key negotiating issues, with the prime minister hoping to "reset" relations. The EU is proposing a "youth mobility scheme" allowing citizens aged 18-30 to stay for up to four years, but concerns exist about its impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are also contentious, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements while UK fishing groups advocate for changes. Post-Brexit paperwork has complicated fish exports, and Cornish fishermen want to restrict EU vessels from fishing closer to the coast.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a manhunt and internal investigation. The inmates created a hole in a cell wall and exited through a loading dock, scaling a wall and running across an interstate. Sheriff Susan Hutson believes the escapees received assistance from individuals within the department, and three Sheriff’s Office employees have been suspended without pay. One of the escapees, Kendell Myles, has been apprehended, while the remaining nine are still at large. Officials are investigating multiple security failures, including defective locks and doors and inoperable security cameras.</p>

Kaine Wright and Joe Chappell are accused of stealing items worth £679,000 from a Harry Winston store in 2015. The chief magistrate rejected their challenges against extradition, and the case now goes to the home secretary. This would be the first time Japan successfully receives fugitives from the UK, as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries. The men raised concerns about prison conditions in Japan, which they argued were arbitrary and breached international standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that his negative comments about Taylor Swift last year have hurt her popularity. He wrote on Truth Social that she's "no longer 'HOT'" since he said "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!" The White House stated that Trump, as a business and entertainment mogul, is qualified to comment on celebrities. Trump's initial post followed Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris, and he has a history of criticizing celebrities who oppose him politically. Trump also criticized Bruce Springsteen in a separate post.</p>

          <p>A woman traveled to Madrid on a British Airways flight but was recorded as a no-show because she unwittingly used a boarding pass with someone else's name. Despite checking in and boarding normally, the airline insisted she was not on the flight, leading to issues with her return booking. The woman later discovered her boarding pass had the name of a man named Huw H. British Airways has offered a voucher and refunded the extra ticket cost, but the incident raises security concerns about passenger verification protocols.</p>

          <p>A California environmental board voted to rescind a controversial proposal that would have allowed municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil currently designated for hazardous waste sites. Environmental advocates and community members raised concerns about toxic dust and groundwater contamination. The decision followed months of scrutiny and opposition to the plan, with state officials acknowledging the concerns. The proposal aimed to ease the disposal of contaminated soil, but critics argued it would weaken environmental protections and rely on federal rules.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt amid high interest rates. The agency expects federal deficits to widen and the federal debt burden to rise significantly over the next decade. The downgrade occurred as the GOP-led House Budget Committee rejected a tax cut package, including extending the 2017 tax cuts. This action brings Moody's in line with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which had previously downgraded the U.S.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit seeks to prevent the Los Angeles Zoo from moving its two surviving elephants, Billy and Tina, to another zoo in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with animal-rights advocates, including Cher, advocating for their relocation to an animal sanctuary. The zoo's decision to move the elephants comes after two aging members of the herd were euthanized. Advocates argue that the elephants' enclosure is restrictive and harmful, while zoo officials claim the move is in the best interest of the animals, a stance which has been publicly challenged by city officials. The battle reflects a broader trend of zoos closing elephant enclosures amid lawsuits and shrinking animal populations.</p>
