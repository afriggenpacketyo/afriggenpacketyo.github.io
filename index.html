        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are adopting the concept of 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. This shift marks a departure from the traditional Japanese work ethic of long hours and unwavering loyalty to employers, with many young people valuing experiences like travel and socializing over professional success. Factors contributing to this change include witnessing their parents' sacrifices for companies, the rising cost of living, and a desire for greater personal fulfillment. The coronavirus pandemic has further prompted some to question their priorities, leading to a reevaluation of work's role in their lives, with the added benefit of potentially reducing 'karoshi,' or death by overwork.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 7-5 victory against the New York Mets in 13 innings, enduring a lengthy rain delay and significant strain on their pitching staff. Starter Clayton Kershaw's outing was cut short due to the delay, and closer Tanner Scott blew a three-run lead in the ninth. Despite these challenges, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar Hernández driving in the go-ahead run in the 13th. The article notes the win comes at a cost, potentially exacerbating existing pitching staff issues amid a demanding schedule against playoff-contending teams.</p>

While playing for your boyhood club can be a dream come true, it also brings added pressure and scrutiny from fans who expect immediate success. Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher notes that players may sacrifice opportunities for other clubs to maintain their connection with local supporters. Former Norwich striker Chris Sutton emphasizes the intense attachment and responsibility local players feel, playing not just for the club but for their community and family.</p>

          <p>A former people smuggler detailed how he used yachts to transport Vietnamese migrants into UK marinas, exploiting lax security. The smuggler, identified as Nick, revealed he also smuggled Albanian people in cars onto ferries, where they then jumped into lorries mid-journey. He claims private marinas have minimal security, making them easy targets for smuggling operations. Nick, now speaking out after serving prison time, asserts that these routes remain active, highlighting the need for improved security measures. Border Force acknowledges the concerning risk and is reviewing vulnerabilities, focusing resources on small boat crossings while other methods remain a challenge.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan's representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling closer ties with Beijing. This move follows a similar action by Somalia, which banned Taiwanese passport holders, reflecting a growing alignment between African nations and China, driven by economic interests. Experts note that Beijing has historically pressured African countries to distance themselves from Taiwan, and the deepening economic relationship makes African states hesitant to offend China by giving Taiwan any prominence. Taiwan's only official diplomatic ally in Africa remains eSwatini.</p>

Conversely, The Times focuses on a positive development: plans to establish mental health A&Es across the UK to alleviate pressure on hospitals. Other headlines include Donald Trump's threats of higher EU tariffs, an interview with the Princess of Wales' brother, and Feargal Sharkey's prostate cancer diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government-held rice stockpiles directly to retailers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. This initiative comes amid criticism that the government has not effectively curbed the spike in rice prices, which have nearly doubled due to a poor harvest and increased demand. The government intends to release 300,000 tons initially, with potential for additional supplies, and is exploring online sales to ensure widespread access. However, analysts caution that the limited reserve amount may not significantly impact overall rice prices.</p>

          <p>This article critiques Germany's selective approach to confronting its Nazi past, arguing that while the country publicly acknowledges its historical crimes, it often ignores or downplays societal entanglement with state violence and genocide. The author points to the Herbert Quandt Media Prize, which celebrates the legacy of an early SS supporter who exploited slave labor, as an example of this selective amnesia. Furthermore, the article highlights the continued presence of streets named after colonial administrators who orchestrated genocides, illustrating a broader German reluctance to fully confront the depths of its historical complicity.</p>

This trend reflects a broader shift as countries seek alternatives to the US dollar due to trade war repercussions.

          <p>The CEO of Sakana AI, a Japanese AI startup backed by Nvidia, is advocating for the Japanese government to prioritize the development of its own AI technology for defense purposes. David Ha emphasizes the growing need for self-reliance in defense technology amid increasing deglobalization and a complex security environment. While the U.S. has become more U.S.-centric, there is a potential for AI to become 'a bargaining chip for other countries,' if its services and models are so powerful. Japan's Defense Ministry is exploring AI applications in areas like target detection and cybersecurity.</p>

          <p>Japanese supermarket operators are increasingly offering cheaper, foreign-grown rice to consumers facing record-high prices for domestic rice. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than Japanese-grown rice, reflecting consumer demand for more affordable options. Other retailers, such as Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co., have also seen strong sales of rice from California and Taiwan. The move aims to provide consumers with greater choice and potentially increase overall rice consumption, with the U.S. Ambassador to Japan calling it 'historic' for American farmers.</p>
