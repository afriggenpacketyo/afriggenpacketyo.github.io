          <p>Two police officers, Detective Neal Thompson (59) and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart (35), were shot dead while on duty in Porepunkah, Australia, prompting a large-scale manhunt for suspect Dezi Freeman (56). The officers were executing a warrant for alleged sexual offenses when the shootout occurred, also injuring another officer. Freeman, described as a 'sovereign citizen' with documented anti-authority views, remains at large in dense bushland. The incident has deeply affected the policing community and the tight-knit rural town, raising questions about how authorities address extremist ideologies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a miniature 10th-century ivory figurine, believed to be the first 'portrait' of a Viking, depicting a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache and braided beard. The 1.2-inch walrus tusk carving, found in Norway in 1796 and long forgotten, contrasts with simpler Viking depictions by showcasing detailed facial expressions and a smiling demeanor. Curators suggest the figure, possibly a board game piece representing a king, challenges the perception of Vikings as savage and highlights the importance of grooming and status in their era.</p>

          <p>An analysis evaluates the feasibility of Reform UK's migration plan, which proposes mass deportations of 500,000-600,000 people and the construction of detention facilities for 24,000 individuals monthly. The plan faces significant challenges, including an estimated £12 billion cost for secure facilities and potential legal hurdles regarding human rights and due process, as similar fast-track schemes have been ruled unlawful. Pulling out of international treaties like the ECHR could also breach the Good Friday Agreement and impact trade relations, making the ambitious targets difficult to achieve.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces have acknowledged that Russia's military has entered the eastern industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk, attempting to establish a foothold, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. While Ukraine claims the advance has been halted, the incursion is a blow to morale, occurring as U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to end the war appear to falter. Russian President Putin reportedly offered to end the war if Ukraine cedes remaining Donetsk territories, but Ukrainian officials and EU leaders warn against such concessions, emphasizing Russia's aggressive stance and broader territorial ambitions.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their gas and electricity bills rise by 2% starting in October, as energy regulator Ofgem announced the latest price cap increase. This adjustment means a typical household will pay £1,755 annually, an increase of £35, signaling another winter of high energy costs. The rise is partly due to wholesale energy prices and new government support measures, which all billpayers will fund. Campaigners express concern that many families continue to struggle with high bills and accumulated energy debt, despite the new support initiatives.</p>

          <p>A time capsule buried by Diana, Princess of Wales, at Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh) in 1991 has been opened, offering a nostalgic glimpse into the 1990s. The lead-encased wooden box contained items selected by competition-winning children, including a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a pocket TV, and a passport. Originally intended for unearthing in 'hundreds of years,' it was retrieved to make way for a new children's cancer center. Despite some damage, the artifacts are largely intact, providing a unique historical snapshot and connecting to Diana's legacy at the hospital.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, testified in court that she never physically touched, scratched, or spat at a security guard who is suing her for alleged assault. During the civil trial, Cardi B admitted to a verbal altercation, stating she called the guard a 'b—' because she believed the guard was recording her. The security guard, Emani Ellis, claims the rapper cursed, used slurs, body-shamed her, and scratched her. Cardi B maintained that the incident was entirely verbal, despite being four months pregnant at the time.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's steep 50% tariffs on India have taken effect, penalizing India for its purchases of Russian oil and posing a significant threat to its export-driven industries. In response, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged domestic self-reliance, promoting 'Made in India' goods and promising a 'massive tax bonanza' through tax cuts and GST reforms. This move aims to stimulate private consumption, a major component of India's GDP, and mitigate the economic blow from tariffs. The situation underscores a growing global economic nationalism and India's efforts to counter external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's escalating tariffs are fostering a political counter-reaction, compelling nations in the Global South to reconsider old alliances and forge new paths. Countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and China are discussing collective protection, possibly through the BRICS alliance, to bypass U.S. economic dominance and protect their sovereignty. Trump is increasingly using tariffs to impose political will on non-trade issues, leading to calls for de-dollarization and diversification of trade partners. This shift suggests a potential long-term realignment of global economic and political power, with China emerging as a significant beneficiary.</p>
