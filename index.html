          <p>A federal judge will allow prosecutors to downgrade charges against L.A. County Sheriff’s Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of using excessive force. Initially convicted of a felony for pepper-spraying an unarmed woman, the charges will be reduced to a misdemeanor, but Kirk could still face jail time. The decision follows controversy over a plea deal offered by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, leading to resignations from several federal prosecutors. The incident involved Kirk using excessive force against Jacey Houseton, and the case has raised concerns about accountability and justice.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have solved a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing the issue of violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at high speeds. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation found that track irregularities and electromagnetic resonance can cause uncomfortable turbulence. They developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more tolerable. This research could potentially revive interest in vacuum-tube maglev technology, including Elon Musk’s Hyperloop concept.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's latest Starship launch reached orbit but experienced issues with attitude control after entering its suborbital trajectory, leading to an uncontrolled re-entry. An apparent propellant leak caused the spacecraft to spin, and mission control was unable to steer the craft. The company said the vehicle likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean and cleared a large area of the landing zone for safety. Despite the incomplete mission, SpaceX said the test would provide valuable data for improving Starship's reliability for future missions.</p>

          <p>Harvard University, recently divided over issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and free speech, has found a unifying cause in the Trump administration's attacks. The Department of Homeland Security's decision to bar Harvard from enrolling international students and the freezing of billions in federal grants have galvanized the campus. Students and faculty are setting aside differences to defend the university, with a pro-Palestinian demonstrator and a former Jewish leader joining forces. The move has sparked a sense of unity and school pride, prompting Harvard to sue the federal government.</p>

While some experts agree the original vaccination course offered protection, the need for annual vaccines against new variants is contentious. The risk of severe disease and hospitalization among infants was comparable to that among adults 65 and older.</p>
