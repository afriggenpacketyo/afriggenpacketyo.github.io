          <p>Following the outbreak of conflict, international museum organizations have warned of the growing danger to cultural heritage sites in Israel and Iran. In response, museums in both nations have activated contingency plans, working to secure and relocate valuable artifacts to protect them from potential damage. While specific sites like the National Museum in Tehran have been emptied, the full extent of any damage, particularly to open-air archaeological sites, remains unclear due to restricted access and reporting.

          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean Combs has begun deliberations on charges of sex trafficking, transportation for prostitution, and racketeering. The prosecution portrayed Combs as a violent and controlling figure who coerced women into illegal sex acts, using his business empire to facilitate these activities. In contrast, the defense argued that while Combs's sex life was unconventional, the encounters were consensual and not part of a criminal enterprise. The trial featured testimony from 34 witnesses, including two former girlfriends who detailed their abusive and coercive relationships with the music mogul.</p>

          <p>The e-commerce sector is facing its most significant disruption in over a decade, with a new survey from AlixPartners revealing a sharp decline in online shopping activity. The data shows double-digit drops in year-over-year purchases for categories like office supplies, sporting goods, and electronics, attributed largely to the impact of President Trump's trade tariffs. These tariffs are altering consumer behavior, causing many to delay purchases or seek domestic alternatives to avoid higher prices, while retailers adjust shipping policies to manage rising costs.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is in a marathon session as Republican leadership scrambles to gather enough votes to pass President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The process has been complicated by holdouts within the party, such as Senators Lisa Murkowski and Rand Paul, who have concerns about various provisions. The political maneuvering has been intense, with President Trump publicly criticizing opponent Elon Musk, who has threatened to back primary challengers against Republicans who support the bill.

Key debates revolved around amendments concerning Medicaid funding and support for rural hospitals, with leaders negotiating with potential holdouts to ensure the bill could pass before the self-imposed July 4 deadline.

          <p>The future of Planned Parenthood is in jeopardy following a Supreme Court ruling that allows states to exclude the organization from their Medicaid programs. This decision, combined with a potential nationwide Medicaid ban being considered in Congress, threatens to choke off critical funding and could force the closure of nearly 200 clinics. This article argues that these actions represent a significant blow to reproductive healthcare access, particularly for low-income women, and are part of a broader judicial agenda to enforce a regressive vision of gender roles through the regulation of medicine.</p>

          <p>Certain widely prescribed medications can increase the risk of heat-related illness by interfering with the body's natural ability to regulate temperature. The article identifies several drug classes, including some antidepressants, heart medications like beta-blockers and diuretics, and stimulants, that can impair processes such as sweating and fluid balance. This can make it significantly harder for individuals to cool down in hot weather, potentially leading to dehydration, overheating, or even heatstroke.

          <p>The number of American children who regularly ride bicycles has fallen by nearly half since the 1990s, marking the decline of a classic childhood pastime. This article explores the reasons for this trend, pointing to parental fears over busier roads, faster speed limits, and larger vehicles that make streets feel more dangerous. The decline in biking represents more than a loss of exercise; it signifies a reduction in children's independence, decision-making practice, and connection to their neighborhoods, contributing to a more supervised and less resilient generation.</p>
