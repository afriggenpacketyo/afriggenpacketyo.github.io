        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from think tank Ember reveals that renewable energy became the world's leading source of electricity for the first time in the first half of 2024. The growth in solar and wind power met all new global electricity demand, even causing a slight decrease in fossil fuel usage. However, the progress is uneven, with developing nations like China leading the transition while developed countries, including the US and EU, increased their reliance on fossil fuels during the same period. This highlights a significant divergence in global energy strategies.</p>

Mosley was an accomplice to Mick and Mairead Philpott, the children's parents, in a scheme to set fire to their home to frame a former lover. The plan went tragically wrong, leading to the deaths of Jade Philpott and her five brothers. Mosley had been released on license after serving part of his 17-year sentence.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens have been released into Exmoor National Park as part of a major conservation effort. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project introduced 19 of the mammals, relocated from the Scottish Highlands, to secret locations to re-establish their population. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar for monitoring, and conservationists view their return as a critical step in restoring the woodland ecosystem's natural balance. The project is seen as a positive sign for nature restoration in the region.</p>

          <p>Amid growing uncertainty about the reliability of U.S. global leadership, key allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific are strengthening their own diplomatic, economic, and security partnerships. Nations like the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, and Australia are increasingly coordinating on issues such as trade, technology standards, and defense without direct U.S. involvement. This strategic shift aims to build resilience against both Chinese economic pressure and rising protectionism in the United States. The goal is not to sever ties with Washington but to create a more robust network of middle powers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals saw a dramatic surge in premarket trading after the White House announced it would acquire a 10% stake in the company. The U.S. government's $35.6 million investment is part of a strategic initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a previous administration's decision to block the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal focus on securing domestic supply chains for defense and energy. The project remains controversial due to potential environmental impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

A tropical storm watch is in effect, and authorities are warning of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coast.

In a surprising move, opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered Netanyahu a "security net" to ensure the government's stability during sensitive hostage negotiations with Hamas. This support is crucial as far-right members of Netanyahu's coalition have threatened to leave over disagreements regarding a U.S.-backed peace plan.

          <p>This opinion article argues that nine major U.S. universities must reject a proposed "compact" from the Trump administration, which offers preferential funding in exchange for adherence to certain policies. The author contends the compact is a veiled attack on academic freedom, demanding ideological balance within departments and capping the number of foreign students. The proposal is described as a loyalty oath that uses vague criteria to enforce compliance and could create deep divisions within institutions. The article concludes that accepting the deal would subject universities to arbitrary government power and undermine their core mission.</p>

The law was prompted by widespread consumer complaints about jarringly loud advertisements, particularly from parents of young children.

          <h2>Opinion: UEFA's Decision to Allow Domestic Soccer Games Abroad Marks a Turning Point for the Sport</h2>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes UEFA's recent decision to permit domestic league matches to be played overseas, citing it as a betrayal of soccer's community-based traditions. The author argues that allowing games like a La Liga match in Miami and a Serie A match in Perth opens the floodgates for leagues to prioritize global revenue over local fans and competitive integrity. While UEFA expressed opposition, it claimed its hands were tied by FIFA's rules following a lawsuit. The article concludes this move represents the full "Americanization" of European soccer, where unfettered capitalism now supersedes all other considerations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's push to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities without state approval is testing the legal limits of presidential power. This move relies on Title 10, a rarely used statute that allows the president to bring the Guard into federal service during an invasion, rebellion, or when unable to execute federal laws. While the administration claims it cannot enforce immigration laws due to protests, legal experts and state officials argue this justification is a stretch of the statute's intent. The deployments are facing mixed results in federal courts, with some judges blocking the orders while others allow them to proceed.</p>

          <p>Amid the federal government shutdown and threats of mass layoffs, some furloughed federal workers argue that the crisis is merely highlighting the damage already inflicted on public services by the Trump administration. An employee from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stated that programs Americans rely on were being shuttered and staff were being fired long before the shutdown began. They point to the cancellation of hundreds of research grants and layoffs of communications staff as evidence of a systematic effort to gut agency functions. These workers are urging Congress to use its "power of the purse" to push back against these actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a case from Colorado challenging the state's ban on conversion therapy for individuals under 18. The practice, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, has been repudiated by major medical organizations as ineffective and harmful. A conservative Christian legal group, representing a therapist, argues that the ban infringes on free speech rights during talk therapy. The state of Colorado counters that it has the authority to regulate licensed medical professionals and protect minors from what is considered substandard and dangerous care.</p>

Her appearance follows the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, a move that came after public demands from the president. Critics, including hundreds of former DOJ employees, argue that a firewall between the White House and the department has been dismantled, pointing to the firing of prosecutors and the departure of staff from key divisions.

Israeli society remains traumatized by the attack and divided over the government's handling of the conflict and the fate of the remaining hostages.

          <p>The Hopi Tribe in Arizona is facing a major setback after the Trump administration terminated the "Solar for All" program, which had approved a $25 million grant for the tribe. The project was intended to install solar panels and battery storage for about 600 homes on the reservation, many of which have never had access to reliable electricity. The funding cut means the tribe can now only hope to power a fraction of those homes, forcing difficult decisions about who will receive aid. This reversal is part of a broader rollback of renewable energy initiatives established under the previous administration's Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has abruptly canceled a series of federal surveys that have tracked high school students for over 50 years. This long-running research, known as the high school longitudinal studies, has provided crucial data for education policy on topics ranging from college readiness to career pathways. Educators and researchers have expressed alarm over the decision, warning that the cancellation will leave a significant gap in understanding student progress, particularly for the cohort that experienced the COVID-19 pandemic.
