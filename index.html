        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first test between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion at Headingley after centuries from KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant put India in a strong position, only for Josh Tongue's late spell to keep England in contention. Rahul's classical 137 and Pant's entertaining 118 helped India reach 364, setting England a target of 371 to win, with England losing their last six wickets for just 31 runs. England survived six overs to close on 21-0, leaving all results possible on the final day with the pitch offering increasingly venomous bounce. The match is made more intriguing by a mixed weather forecast, and England's commitment to never playing for a draw means their approach on Tuesday will be an examination of their philosophy, which could lead to an exciting finish. The second batter to make hundreds in each innings on this ground, Pant became the second wicketkeeper to do so anywhere.</p>

A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The mission was initially rescheduled twice due to unfavorable weather and a rocket booster issue. This launch represents a significant step in Amazon's plan to create a massive satellite constellation for providing internet connectivity.

Novo Nordisk accused Hims & Hers of violating laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization and engaging in deceptive marketing practices that endanger patient safety.

The agreement allows individual advertisers to specify ad placements but prohibits agreements to steer ad dollars towards or away from publishers based on their political leanings. The FTC's decision also resolves potential claims related to alleged coordination with media watchdogs accused of orchestrating advertiser boycotts. The agency's chairman, Andrew Ferguson, emphasized the importance of protecting free speech rights while addressing concerns about potential collusion in the media-buying market.

          <p>On the 53rd anniversary of Title IX, SEC Linda McMahon and Payton McNabb advocate for protecting women's sports by ensuring fair and safe competition based on biological sex. They argue that allowing men in women's sports is unfair and potentially dangerous, citing injuries like those suffered by Payton McNabb from a volleyball spiked by a male athlete. The Trump administration has taken a firm stance against discrimination in sports, launching investigations into states allegedly violating Title IX by allowing men to compete in women's events. They emphasize that states risk losing federal funding if they fail to uphold equal opportunity protections based on biological sex. The authors believe that women deserve fair and safe competition, and their voices are being heard under the current administration.</p>

While the broader tech sector has rebounded strongly, Apple has traded below its 50- and 200-day moving averages, marking its worst relative performance against its sector fund since 2002. Investors are primarily buying the broad stock market on dips, which inherently includes a significant weighting in tech, with top tech stocks representing over 30% of the S&P 500. Despite concerns about valuation, some analysts view market volatility as a buying opportunity for tech stocks, particularly those involved in the AI revolution.

She highlights the role of porn in shaping young people's understanding of sex and the need for comprehensive sex education that addresses consent and sexual health. Sherman also discusses the lasting impact of the #MeToo movement on young women and the trend of young men moving to the Right, feeling demonized by the movement.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, was violently detained and injured by federal agents in Orange County. A video of the incident shows masked agents tackling, restraining, and repeatedly striking Barranco, who was working as a landscaper outside a Santa Ana IHOP. His son, Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran, stated that his father was pepper-sprayed and suffered a dislocated shoulder. The Department of Homeland Security and ICE have not immediately responded to requests for comment. A GoFundMe campaign was created to assist with legal representation, raising over $48,000 by Sunday night.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, alleging that the company is using "monopoly tactics" by banning private home listings. Compass claims Zillow's policy excludes homes marketed off Zillow for more than one day from being listed on Zillow and its partners' platforms, Redfin and eXp Realty. The lawsuit argues that this "Zillow Ban" prevents competition and reduces homeowner choice. Compass seeks an injunction to stop Zillow from enforcing this policy and is requesting unspecified damages and a jury trial. Zillow stated that the claims are unfounded and that it will vigorously defend against them.</p>

          <p>Following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended the US actions, stating there was no reason to criticize them. The German government was informed of the attacks only after they had already begun, similar to when Israel attacked Iranian nuclear facilities. Germany, along with France and the UK, issued a statement urging Iran not to take further actions that could destabilize the region, but did not criticize the US attack. The question of whether the US attack was justified under international law has sparked debate among German politicians, with some expressing concerns about the lack of legitimacy under international law. Germany is attempting to balance its relationship with the US while addressing concerns about international law and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Sina Toossi argues that the joint US-Israeli strikes on Iran reflect a bankrupt approach to Iran based on pressure and destabilization. The author contends that the strikes are a desperate attempt to change the regime and prop up Israeli dominance. Despite causing damage, Iran's missile barrages have exposed Israeli vulnerabilities and Tehran appears to have anticipated the US attack on Fordow. The author suggests that Iran's nuclear infrastructure is designed to withstand such attacks and that military escalation risks pushing Iran closer to weaponization. Diplomacy is seen as the only durable solution, requiring a reassessment of US policy in the Middle East.</p>

A comparison of a $10,000 deposit in a 6-month CD versus a traditional savings account shows that the CD earns substantially more interest. The higher returns of CDs are guaranteed, while traditional savings account rates are variable and unlikely to become competitive.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When facing both medical and credit card debt, prioritizing credit card debt is generally advisable to protect your credit score and avoid compounding interest charges. Credit card activity is reported monthly, and high interest rates can quickly increase balances. Medical debt, on the other hand, often has a longer grace period before affecting credit scores and can be more negotiable. While both types of debt can end up in collections, credit card issuers tend to be more aggressive. Ultimately, the best approach is to proactively manage both types of debt by exploring payment assistance and negotiating payment plans. (not investment advice)</p>
