            <p>An opinion piece discusses the challenges of viewpoint diversity in universities, particularly concerning Donald Trump's demands for ideological balance at Harvard. The author argues that Trump's approach, which involves affirmative action for conservatives and abolishing other diversity policies, is contradictory and undermines scholarly objectivity. The article highlights the complexities of fostering genuine intellectual engagement versus imposing political mandates, suggesting that state intervention and bureaucratic procedures are not the solution to cultural shifts within universities. It emphasizes the need to encourage open-mindedness and the capacity to consider multiple perspectives, rather than creating intellectual silos. </p>
