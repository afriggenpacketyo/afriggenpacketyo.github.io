          <h2>An Exploration of the Reader's Urge to Finish a Book</h2>

          <p>In this article, James Parker explores the common phenomenon of wanting to finish a book, even when thoroughly enjoying it. The author contemplates the linear momentum of reading and suggests that readers may unconsciously pick up on the writer's energy as the end approaches. Parker also delves into the nature of experience, questioning why individuals cannot rest in the moment and are always anticipating the next. Ultimately, the article offers a philosophical reflection on the human desire for narrative progression and completion.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars has announced a cost-cutting initiative of 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.87 billion) and withdrawn its financial guidance after experiencing a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter of the year.

CEO HÃ¥kan Samuelsson acknowledged a challenging market with volume drops, price competition, and tariff pressures, emphasizing the company's focus on controlling costs.

          <p>JetBlue Airways is preparing to announce a partnership with another U.S. airline that has a larger network, according to the company's president. This move comes after JetBlue's acquisition of Spirit Airlines was blocked and its partnership with American Airlines unraveled due to antitrust issues. The new partnership aims to enhance JetBlue's competitiveness against larger airlines like Delta and United, allowing customers to earn and use loyalty points on a broader network. The announcement is expected this quarter, with JetBlue emphasizing the benefits for customers in the Northeast who frequently travel to destinations not currently served by the airline.</p>

          <p>During the first 100 days of President Trump's second term, the State Department revoked the visas of 4,000 foreign students, with 90% having serious criminal records, according to a senior State Department official. These crimes included arson, trafficking, child endangerment, domestic abuse, and robbery. The State Department coordinated with the Department of Homeland Security to cross-check student visa holders' information with law enforcement records, focusing on serious offenses. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that visas should be for students who want to study and get a degree, not for those who "create a ruckus."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's approach to trade and economics, particularly his views on tariffs, fundamentally contradicts traditional American conservative economic philosophy. The author contends that Trump's belief in setting prices and controlling the economy from the top down aligns more closely with left-wing economic thought, which assumes experts and planners can direct the economy better than a free market. The article contrasts this with the conservative viewpoint emphasizing the knowledge problem and the efficiency of free markets, suggesting that many on the right are discrediting themselves by supporting Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's push for increased oil and gas production, the U.S. oil industry is facing challenges, with U.S. crude oil prices falling below $65 per barrel, making production unprofitable for many companies. Oilfield service firms are warning of slowed investment in exploration and production due to falling prices and economic uncertainty. Executives have criticized Trump's policies, citing "uncertainty" as a major concern. SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch noted that Trump's tariffs are contributing to economic uncertainty and potentially hurting demand.</p>

          <p>House Education and Workforce Committee Republicans have released a plan to overhaul the student loan and financial aid system, aiming to limit student borrowing and reduce repayment options. The GOP measure, known as the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, seeks to address rising college costs. Consumer advocates have warned that the proposal would restrict college access by slashing financial aid programs and making it harder to repay student loan debt. The plan immediately triggered warnings from consumer advocates, who said the measures would deepen the affordability crisis families already face in paying for college.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced an expansion of its cost-cutting efforts, projecting additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, primarily through enhanced digital enablement and streamlining business processes.

The company maintained its full-year 2025 outlook, but noted that this guidance does not include any potential impact related to future tariffs and trade policy changes.

Community health workers, like Geoffrey Chanda, have lost their jobs, leaving many individuals without access to essential medications and preventive care.

          <p>This article discusses the recent victory of the Liberal Party in Canada, attributing it to both the party's political talent and the influence of Donald Trump. The Liberals, led by Mark Carney, have secured a plurality in Parliament after trailing in polls, capitalizing on Trump's threats to annex Canada and implementing progressive policies. The article highlights the Liberals' success in expanding Canada's welfare state and suggests that Democrats in the United States could learn from their northern neighbors' ability to adapt and prioritize viable candidates.</p>
