          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively silenced them, Afghanistan's women's refugee football team is set to compete internationally again in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series. For the players, now living in countries like the UK and Australia, the tournament is more than about sports; it's a powerful act of representation for women whose rights have been stripped away in their homeland. The team's defender, Najma Arefi, describes it as a responsibility to be a voice for the silenced and to show resilience. This event marks a significant step toward their official recognition by FIFA and symbolizes hope and defiance against oppression.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace deal, a new analysis explores five divergent paths for the Middle East, shaped by President Trump's leadership. The most optimistic scenario envisions a "golden horizon" of regional prosperity, with Israeli innovation and Gulf capital creating a new trade corridor. Conversely, other possibilities include a resurgent Iran re-arming its proxies, Hamas rebranding and regrouping within Gaza, or a stagnant "cold stability" without real progress. The article argues that securing a lasting peace requires strong enforcement of the deal's terms, isolating spoilers like Iran, and continued, firm American leadership to prevent a relapse into conflict.</p>

          <p>In the week following a policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has not conducted any major military exercises near the island. According to Taiwan's defense ministry, daily PLA sorties ranged from seven to 27, a significantly lower number compared to the large-scale drills seen in the past. For instance, a previous exercise in April involved 76 sorties in a single day as a "serious warning" to what Beijing considers independence forces. The current relative calm suggests a period of observation from Beijing rather than immediate military escalation.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner, a key architect of the recent Israel-Hamas peace agreement, stated that the long-term success of the deal hinges on establishing a "viable alternative" for governing Gaza. In an interview, Kushner predicted that Hamas would use violence to try and reassert its control, a warning that came just before the U.S. reported potential Hamas plans to attack civilians. He emphasized that if the international community and Israel can successfully create a new, effective governing body for Gaza, Hamas's influence will fail. The 20-point plan calls for an interim body of Palestinians and international experts, but its formation is critical to preventing a resurgence of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza was tested as Israel's military conducted airstrikes and artillery fire in southern Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces stated the action was a response to Hamas attacks on its soldiers, which reportedly included sniper fire and a rocket-propelled grenade in an Israeli-controlled area. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take "strong action" against such violations. Hamas, however, denied any involvement in clashes in the Rafah area, stating it had lost contact with its remaining groups there and reaffirmed its full commitment to the ceasefire agreement, creating a tense and uncertain situation.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of committing "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty after a U.S. strike on a boat in Colombian waters. Petro claimed the vessel, carrying fisherman Alejandro Carranza, was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure when it was attacked, resulting in Carranza's death. This incident is one of at least six recent U.S. strikes on ships in the Caribbean, which the Trump administration says are targeting drug traffickers. Petro vehemently denied Carranza had any ties to the drug trade and has demanded a formal explanation from the U.S. government for the lethal action.</p>

This move follows Petro's recent accusation that the U.S. committed murder by striking a Colombian fishing boat in the Caribbean.

          <p>Six months after the implementation of sweeping tariffs by the Trump administration, Americans across the country are reporting significant financial strain from rising prices and product scarcity. Consumers describe smaller grocery lists, higher budgets, and having to forgo items like steak and affordable car tires. The impact contradicts administration claims that the policy would lower costs, with recent studies suggesting the tariffs will cost the average household nearly $2,400 more per year. Many shoppers have been forced to change their habits, driving longer distances to find better prices and dealing with increasingly bare store shelves for staple goods.</p>

          <p>Georgia is experiencing an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, largely fueled by the construction of new data centers for artificial intelligence. The state's main utility, Georgia Power, has requested a nearly $16 billion plan to generate 10 additional gigawatts of energy, with about 80% of that increase dedicated to powering these facilities. This has sparked significant concern among consumer advocates and environmental groups, who fear it will lead to higher utility bills for residential customers and an increased reliance on fossil fuels. The state's Public Service Commission is now tasked with balancing the massive industrial demand with its impact on consumers and the environment.</p>

          <p>A Suzhou-based robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has experienced a massive influx of orders from American clients, who are making "emergency purchases" to preempt potential new tariffs from the Trump administration. President Trump has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting U.S. companies to stockpile components like the intelligent drive modules the firm produces for humanoid robots. The company, which has jokingly thanked Trump for acting as a "sales consultant," is now running its factories overtime to ship products before the threatened tariff deadline. This surge highlights the disruptive impact of trade policy uncertainty on global supply chains.</p>

          <p>AI startup Anthropic finds itself in a policy battle with the Trump administration over the future of artificial intelligence regulation. Anthropic, founded on the principle of building safer AI, has advocated for stronger state-level safety and transparency rules, directly opposing the administration's push to preempt such laws. David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, has publicly accused Anthropic of "fear-mongering" and running a "sophisticated regulatory capture strategy" that he claims hinders U.S. innovation and its ability to compete with China.

Liu defended China's retaliatory fees on U.S. ships as a necessary measure to safeguard its own shipping industry's interests.

          <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene, long one of Donald Trump's most loyal supporters, has recently surprised observers by breaking from the Republican party line on several key issues. The Georgia congresswoman has criticized the war in Gaza as a "genocide," pushed for the release of the Epstein files, and sided with Democrats to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, winning praise from unlikely corners. While she has carefully avoided direct criticism of Trump, her independent streak has fueled speculation about her motives and future ambitions. This analysis suggests her actions reflect a populist instinct to side with her constituents, potentially carving out a unique lane within the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's weaponization of federal power against Democratic cities and states, an opinion piece proposes a radical form of resistance: "fiscal disobedience." The author argues that blue states, which contribute the majority of federal tax revenue, should create state-administered escrow accounts to hold these funds in trust. The money would only be released to the federal government once it ceases punitive actions like politically motivated funding cuts and unauthorized military deployments. This strategy, while legally risky, is presented as a way to reclaim leverage and transform a one-sided assault into a constitutional struggle over federalism and executive power.</p>

Despite this, ICE detained him during a routine check-in and is attempting to send him to Ukraine. His legal team argues the detention is unconstitutional as there is no significant likelihood of his removal.
