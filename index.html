Member states are finding it increasingly difficult to remain neutral as both superpowers vie for influence in security, trade, and technology sectors. Key tension points include territorial disputes in the South China Sea and trade policies, forcing nations like the Philippines and Indonesia to perform a delicate balancing act. They aim to maintain crucial economic ties with China while relying on security cooperation with the U.S., highlighting the region's struggle to avoid a zero-sum geopolitical choice.</p>

          <p>The anonymous donor who provided $130 million to help pay U.S. military salaries during the government shutdown has been identified as Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking family. President Trump announced the donation, describing the individual as a "patriot" and friend, without revealing his name. While a significant sum, the donation amounts to only about $100 per service member and may face legal issues under the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is gaining social media attention for an incident at a recent Los Angeles Lakers basketball game. While sitting courtside with singer Madison Beer, amid dating rumors, a basketball flew towards them from the court. Herbert quickly reacted, using his arm to block the ball and prevent it from hitting Beer, an action captured in widely circulated photographs. This moment of quick thinking occurred shortly after Herbert led his team to a significant victory over the Minnesota Vikings, where he threw for three touchdowns, adding to his recent positive public profile.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated the EU is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing. Recent export restrictions and licensing requirements from Beijing have disrupted global supply chains and damaged European industries. Von der Leyen emphasized that while short-term solutions are being explored, the EU is prepared to use all available tools to respond. The long-term strategy involves boosting recycling capabilities, developing domestic production, and forming partnerships with other resource-rich countries like Australia, Canada, and Ukraine to secure alternative supplies.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in north Harris County has been taken into custody and charged with aggravated assault of a family member after allegedly stabbing his 13-year-old sister. Law enforcement responded to a disturbance call at an apartment complex where they found the girl with stab wounds to her torso. She was transported to a hospital for treatment and has since been released, with expectations of a full recovery. The boy initially fled the scene but was later located by authorities. A guardian was reportedly present in the apartment at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a Capitol rioter who was pardoned by President Trump, has been arrested for allegedly making death threats against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to court documents, Moynihan sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" Jeffries at an event in New York City. He has been charged with making a terroristic threat and pleaded not guilty. This incident highlights growing concerns about recidivism among pardoned January 6 defendants and contributes to a rising number of threats against members of Congress, with Capitol Police reporting over 14,000 threat investigations in 2025 alone.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological healing, inspiring global river restoration efforts. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in a century, water quality has improved, and diverse wildlife is returning to the area. To mark the milestone, a group of Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the river's entire length in over 100 years through the "Paddle Tribal Waters" program. This journey not only reconnected the youth with their cultural heritage but also brought together international advocates to witness the successful restoration firsthand.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which would allow Democrats to redraw congressional districts to create five new safe seats, is being marketed to voters as a direct countermeasure to Republican gerrymandering and former President Trump. The "Fight fire with fire" strategy, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to offset recent Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas. Polling suggests this visceral anti-Trump messaging is effective, with a majority of likely voters supporting the measure specifically to oppose the former president. Despite concerns about abandoning the state's independent redistricting commission, the campaign's focus on Trump appears poised to secure a victory.</p>

They assert that Martin, Chloe's former stepfather, was knowingly "playing the system" to receive a lighter sentence for what they describe as a cold-blooded double murder.

It points to a Pentagon blockchain initiative as evidence that the U.S. is also exploring the militarization of digital assets. This perspective indicates that China may be exploring the use of cryptocurrencies to enhance its strategic capabilities and potentially circumvent traditional financial systems and sanctions.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that E. coli from contaminated meat may be responsible for nearly 18% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) among a group of patients in Southern California. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the DNA of E. coli from patients' infections back to strains found in grocery store meats, with turkey and chicken being the most common sources. The findings suggest that foodborne bacteria can colonize in the gut and later cause UTIs, reframing contaminated meat as a broader public health issue beyond food poisoning. The study also noted a higher risk in lower-income areas, pointing to potential systemic issues in food supply chains.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite stocks reaching all-time highs, some financial experts observe that investors are growing wary of passive investment strategies centered on S&P 500 index funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). The primary concern is a lack of diversification, as the technology sector now constitutes a record 35% of the index, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weighting. Consequently, investors are increasingly looking toward small-cap stocks for broader market exposure. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap companies, recently hit an all-time high and has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than a third of Manhattan condo resales between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold at a nominal loss. The median price per square foot has remained largely flat for a decade, a stark contrast to rising home prices in most of the U.S. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual share of unprofitable sales is likely even higher. The luxury market, particularly properties over $10 million, proved to be an exception, consistently yielding profits. This trend reflects a "lost decade" for the general Manhattan condo market.

The video shows the other car recklessly attempting to pass, nearly causing a collision with oncoming traffic, before the driver waves an obscene gesture out the window. The Tesla owner reported the incident and the vehicle's license plate to the police but stated that the authorities seemed uninterested. The video has sparked online discussions about escalating road rage and targeted harassment of EV drivers, highlighting the need for de-escalation and caution on the road.</p>

Harris dismissed current polls that show her with low favorability, stating that she has defied polling expectations throughout her career.

The incident highlights the vulnerabilities of the growing "sleep tech" industry, where consumers depend on complex technology to optimize rest. While the issue was resolved once AWS came back online, it illustrates the potential pitfalls of integrating essential functions like sleep with internet-dependent systems.</p>
