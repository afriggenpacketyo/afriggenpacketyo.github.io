          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with an amber heat health alert remaining for central and southern England. Temperatures are expected to reach 31C, prompting warnings about water safety following the death of a 15-year-old boy in a river in Glasgow. Hosepipe bans are in effect for millions, and an "extreme" wildfire warning is active across most of Scotland, where crews have been battling blazes. The heatwave has caused travel disruptions and is expected to break on Monday with the arrival of cooler weather and rain for most areas, though the southeast may see high temperatures persist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a significant loss in the Democratic primary, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is reportedly planning to run for New York City mayor as an independent candidate. This move would place him in a multi-candidate race against incumbent Eric Adams, Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid numerous scandals, had remained on the ballot as an independent but has not yet officially confirmed his campaign. His potential candidacy introduces a new dynamic into the race, leveraging his remaining political influence against a field of diverse opponents.</p>

          <p>A new Senate committee report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report, marking the one-year anniversary of the event, highlights that requests for assets like counter-assault teams and counter-snipers were not met. It accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials and points to a pattern of communication failures and negligence. The investigation suggests these shortcomings contributed to a preventable tragedy and calls for greater accountability within the agency.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Rand Paul detailed the findings of his committee's report on the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, describing the incident as a "cascade of errors." He stated that the Secret Service denied multiple requests for counter-snipers until the day of the Butler rally and that there was a critical failure in communication regarding the shooter's presence. Paul asserted that then-Director Kimberly Cheatle was untruthful to Congress about the denied requests and criticized the agency for a "cultural cover-up" and inadequate disciplinary actions. He emphasized that the failures were inexcusable and that key personnel involved should not be in charge of security again.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president of Nigeria, has passed away in London at the age of 82 after a prolonged illness. Buhari's tenure as a leader was notable for two distinct periods: first as a military ruler in the 1980s and later as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was marked by efforts to combat corruption and address security challenges, though it was also characterized by public concern over his health and long absences for medical treatment abroad.

This escalation comes amid President Trump's frequent public criticism of Powell for not lowering interest rates. The comments indicate the White House may be laying the groundwork for an unprecedented removal of a Fed chair, a move that would challenge the central bank's traditional independence.

Homan clarified that physical appearance cannot be the sole factor for detaining someone but admitted that U.S. citizens have been mistakenly arrested in raids.

Critics and immigration policy experts argue there is a significant disconnect between the administration's public justification for its aggressive enforcement and the actual profiles of those being arrested.

          <p>A top White House economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, has affirmed that President Trump's recent threats to impose steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union are serious. Hassett stated that the tariffs will be implemented on August 1 unless the administration receives better trade deal offers from its partners. This confirmation has intensified concerns in European capitals, with Germany's chancellor indicating he is working urgently with French and EU leaders to find a solution before the deadline. The administration's hardline stance continues to create uncertainty and pressure on global trade relationships, risking a significant economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite losing their family home of nearly 60 years in the devastating Texas floods, the family of 94-year-old Betty Matteson is determined to rebuild. The house, located on the Guadalupe River, was inundated with water and mud, and the family, who survived by sheltering in the attic, lacks flood insurance. The cost to repair the home is estimated to be half a million dollars. Despite the immense financial challenge and the increasing risk of future floods due to climate change, the family's deep emotional connection and generations of memories tied to the property are driving their decision to restore their cherished home.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a preliminary report into the fatal Air India crash that killed 260 people, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have issued private notifications affirming the safety of fuel switch locks on their aircraft. The crash report had raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches after noting a 2018 FAA advisory that recommended, but did not mandate, inspections of the feature. In a notification to global aviation authorities, the FAA stated it does not consider the switch design an "unsafe condition" that would warrant a mandatory directive, seeking to reassure airlines and regulators about the system's integrity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against a growing backlash from some of his own supporters. The criticism stems from a recent Justice Department memo on the Jeffrey Epstein case that failed to produce a rumored "client list" or evidence of a wider conspiracy, which Bondi had previously hinted at. In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job" and not waste energy on the Epstein case. The situation has highlighted a rift between the Justice Department and figures within the FBI, as well as frustration among those who expected major revelations.</p>

          <p>The dispute between FIFA and the global players' union, Fifpro, has intensified following a FIFA announcement supporting mandatory rest periods for players. While the principle of a 72-hour gap between games and a three-week summer break was announced, Fifpro executives were reportedly not included in the meeting that produced the decision. The union has been raising concerns about player welfare, particularly with the expansion of competitions like the Club World Cup, and has even filed a lawsuit against FIFA. This latest move by FIFA, conducted without key union representation, is seen as a flawed process that escalates the conflict over the crowded fixture calendar.</p>

          <p>Reports from U.S. media indicate that numerous buildings at Camp Mystic, the Texas summer camp where 27 children died in recent floods, were removed from official flood risk maps years ago. According to official records, the camp successfully appealed its high-risk designation on FEMA maps from 2011, despite its location in a low-lying area by the Guadalupe River. This exemption from high-risk flood zones may have lessened requirements for flood insurance and construction regulations. The revelations raise serious questions about the risk assessment process and whether adequate safety measures were in place at the camp ahead of the deadly deluge.</p>

          <p>As geopolitical tensions with China disrupt supply chains, the recycling of electronic waste is emerging as a crucial domestic source for rare earth metals and other critical materials. Next-generation recycling companies are developing innovative methods to extract valuable elements like neodymium, gold, and copper from discarded electronics such as old laptops and smartphones. This "urban mining" helps reduce U.S. dependence on China, which currently dominates the global rare earths market, and aligns with efforts to onshore production. The trend is gaining momentum as a strategic alternative to traditional mining, bolstering U.S. supply chain independence. (not investment advice)</p>
