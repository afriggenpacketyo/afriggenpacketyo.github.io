          <p>Researchers at Nagoya University in Japan have created a device called the OD Checker to measure symptoms of orthostatic dysregulation, a disorder causing dizziness and difficulty standing in children.  The device measures heart rate changes when standing up.  The team hopes it will help children communicate their symptoms more effectively and improve diagnosis and treatment.  The researchers plan to seek private sector support for further development and clinical trials.</p>

          <p>The spending habits of China's Gen Z consumers are driving significant growth in 'new consumer' stocks, including Pop Mart, Mixue, and Laopu Gold.  These companies cater to the preferences of younger consumers, resulting in substantial stock price increases. This contrasts with the underperformance of traditional consumer brands.  Analysts attribute this trend to changing investor sentiment and the potential for future growth in this sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Escalating US-China trade tensions are causing Chinese companies to reconsider building factories in the US, with Mexico previously a favored location due to its proximity and USMCA trade benefits.  Uncertainty surrounding USMCA's future and increased tariffs are impacting investment decisions.  This shift is evident in decreased inquiries for industrial properties in Mexico, particularly in Monterrey.  The article highlights the impact of trade disputes on foreign investment strategies.
