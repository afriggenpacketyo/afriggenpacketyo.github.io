          <p>A woman jailed for inciting racial hatred has claimed she was a 'political prisoner' upon her release from a UK prison. Lucy Connolly served part of a 31-month sentence for a social media post that called for setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers, which followed the 2024 Southport attack. While admitting the post was not her 'finest moment,' she argues her imprisonment was unjust and is now considering legal action against the police for allegedly misrepresenting her comments during the investigation.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's highly active Kilauea volcano has erupted for the 31st time since December, sending lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption poses no threat to homes and is contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, providing a spectacular view for visitors. Scientists explain that the frequent eruptions are part of an ongoing pattern where magma accumulates in a lower chamber before being forced to the surface. The event holds deep cultural significance for Native Hawaiians, who view it as the work of the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>The Mission Viejo high school football team defeated Santa Margarita 7-3 in a tightly contested opening game dominated by strong defensive play. The game's only touchdown came in the third quarter from a 33-yard pass by Ohio State commit Luke Fahey to Jack Junker, overcoming a 3-0 deficit. Both teams' defenses were formidable, with Santa Margarita stopping Mission Viejo on two goal-line situations. The victory was sealed when Mission Viejo's defense prevented a late-game comeback attempt with just seconds remaining on the clock.</p>

          <p>Investigators in San Bernardino County have arrested the parents of a missing 7-month-old baby, Emmanuel Haro, on suspicion of murder. Authorities now believe the infant is deceased and that the parents' initial report of a kidnapping from a Yucaipa parking lot was fabricated. The investigation revealed inconsistencies in the mother's account, and deputies do not believe any other suspects are involved. This development follows a search of the family's home, where another child was removed and placed in protective services.</p>

          <p>North Korea has lodged a formal protest, calling it a 'serious provocation,' after South Korean forces fired warning shots at its soldiers near the inter-Korean border. The incident occurred when North Korean troops briefly crossed the military demarcation line while working in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). South Korea's military stated its troops acted according to standard defensive procedures, and the North Korean soldiers retreated without returning fire. The exchange highlights the persistent military tensions between the two nations despite recent calls for improved relations.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez has been denied parole, just one day after his brother Erik's request for release was also rejected by a California parole board. Convicted for the 1989 murders of their parents, the brothers became eligible for parole after a judge reduced their sentences earlier this year. The board described Lyle as a 'model inmate' in some ways but concluded he still poses a risk to the public, citing his deceptive behavior after the crime and a lack of full insight. The brothers have long maintained they acted in self-defense following years of abuse.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deny federal funding to cities and counties with policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ruling extends a previous injunction to protect over 30 jurisdictions, including major cities like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Judge William Orrick declared the administration's executive orders aimed at these 'sanctuary' communities were an unconstitutional 'coercive threat.' The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to compel local governments to assist in federal immigration crackdowns.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were defeated 2-1 by the San Diego Padres, causing them to fall back into a tie for first place in the National League West division.

The Padres scored their two runs in the fourth inning and their pitching held the Dodgers scoreless for the remainder of the game.

This area is near the edge of a disputed 'extended continental shelf' claimed by the U.S. The deployment highlights increasing geopolitical focus on the Arctic as melting ice opens up new strategic waterways and resource opportunities.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has announced a plan to implement mass deportations of asylum seekers who arrive in the country via small boats. He argues this is the only way to address what he calls a 'massive crisis' threatening national security and risking public disorder. The proposal includes detaining arrivals, taking the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights, and banning asylum claims from those who cross the channel. The Labour party dismissed the plan as 'pie in the sky,' while the Conservatives claimed it recycled their own ideas.</p>

Notably, independent redistricting advocate Charles Munger Jr. donated $10 million to the campaign opposing the measure. The initiative, placed on the ballot by the Democratic-led legislature, is seen as an effort to counter Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas and could potentially add five Democratic seats to Congress.

          <p>A dating app called Tea, designed to help women vet potential partners, has suffered a major data breach, exposing the personal information of its users. Over 70,000 images, including IDs used for verification, were leaked online and used by misogynistic groups to create maps pinpointing the home addresses of approximately 33,000 women. The breach is particularly dangerous for users like one woman who had joined the app for safety after being stalked by an ex-partner. Multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed against the app's parent company following the leak.</p>

          <p>The Texas legislature has given preliminary approval to a new congressional map that heavily favors Republicans and could help the party gain up to five seats in the U.S. House. The redrawing was initiated after a request from Donald Trump to strengthen the GOP's position before the midterm elections. Democrats have fiercely opposed the map, arguing it diminishes the influence of minority voters, and one state senator has threatened a filibuster to delay its final passage. The move is part of a larger political battle, with California Democrats proposing their own redistricting to counteract the Texas plan.</p>

          <p>The Election Commission of India (ECI) is confronting a severe test of its credibility as opposition parties level accusations of voter fraud, manipulation, and inconsistencies in electoral rolls. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has alleged the ECI colluded with the ruling BJP party to rig elections, citing data irregularities. A recent, controversial revision of voter lists in the state of Bihar, which removed 6.5 million names, has intensified the scrutiny. The ECI has denied all allegations, calling them 'false and misleading' and an insult to India's constitution.</p>

          <p>Excel Parking has been forced to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing a court appeal against a woman it had pursued for thousands of pounds in parking charges. The case centered on the company's controversial 'five-minute payment rule,' which penalized drivers who did not pay within five minutes of entering a car park. After a judge dismissed Excel's initial claim and ordered it to pay legal costs, the firm appealed the decision but lost again. The rule has since been banned by private parking associations following widespread criticism.</p>
