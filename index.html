          <p>A significant gorse fire near the Mourne Mountains in County Down, Northern Ireland, is being treated as arson after homes were evacuated and a major incident was declared. Over 100 firefighters worked through the night to control the blaze, which stretched for approximately two miles. The fire service had reduced resources at the site, but officials are urging the public to remain vigilant due to the high risk of wildfires after an amber wildfire warning was issued. Silent Valley Mountain Park is closed until further notice due to the fires.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, reported being denied entry to Israel while traveling to the West Bank, sparking criticism from Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to "spread hate speech," while the MPs stated their trip was organized with UK charities to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. The Foreign Office offered support to the MPs, with Lammy conveying his concerns to the Israeli government. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch defended Israel's right to control its borders, adding to the controversy surrounding the incident.</p>

          <h2>Doctor Explains Causes and Remedies for Chronic Throat Clearing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 05:36:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Laryngologist Dr. Inna Husain explains that chronic throat clearing, a common reflex, can become a harmful habit that damages vocal folds and leads to increased sensitivity. One cause is laryngeal pharyngeal reflux (LPR), or silent reflux, where stomach contents inflame the throat without heartburn symptoms, creating a cycle of irritation. Other causes include allergies, sinusitis, vocal cord issues, aging, asthma, and certain medications. Dr. Husain recommends determining the root cause through an ENT exam, staying hydrated, avoiding irritants like smoking and acidic foods, and using saline nebulizers to help the throat heal.</p>

The blankets, which normally retailed for about C$300, were being sold for over C$1,000 on eBay. HBC owes almost one billion dollars to creditors and the sales of merchandise has helped the company to keep six stores from liquidating.</p>
