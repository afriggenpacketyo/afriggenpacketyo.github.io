          <p>President Trump's associates and crypto entrepreneurs are re-entering the SPAC market, which experienced a boom during the pandemic but later faltered. These new SPAC deals often involve individuals connected to Trump's circle and target cryptocurrency or blockchain companies, capitalizing on renewed investor interest in risky ventures. SPACs offer a quicker route to going public compared to traditional IPOs, attracting those seeking rapid gains. However, the article cautions that SPACs are inherently speculative, as investors provide capital without a defined business plan, betting on the sponsors' ability to find a promising acquisition.

          <p>A viral trend on TikTok suggests that a specific McDonald's order, consisting of a large Coca-Cola and large fries, can alleviate migraine symptoms, leading to the moniker 'McMigraine.' Doctors attribute potential relief to caffeine and carbonation in Coca-Cola, which can constrict blood vessels and settle the stomach, respectively, while the sodium and carbohydrates in fries may address electrolyte imbalances and nausea. The article highlights that this remedy is not a cure and may worsen migraines for some individuals, advising hydration and alternatives like matcha or green tea to address dehydration and electrolyte imbalance without unhealthy components.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court injunction, allowing the termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal proceedings continue. This decision reverses a previous block by a federal judge who cited potential unconstitutional animus behind the termination. The TPS program, established in 1990, provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries facing crises, offering work permits and deportation deferrals. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, and advocates for TPS beneficiaries expressed shock, calling the decision the largest single action stripping immigration status in modern U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her husband, Todd Stermer, nearly 20 years after his death. Stermer was accused of dousing her husband with gasoline and setting him on fire in 2007. Although she claimed it was an accident, prosecutors successfully argued that she intentionally killed him after he discovered her extramarital affair. Stermer was initially convicted in 2010, but a federal appeals court granted her a new trial in 2020, though she was ultimately convicted again.</p>

Instead of selling, Cramer suggests viewing the downgrade as an early warning to increase savings and invest more cautiously. He recommends gold and bitcoin as potential hedges against government borrowing, while warning investors against succumbing to fear-mongering.</p>

          <h2>AI Therapy: Benefits and Risks of Chatbot Counseling Explored</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 19:04:34 EDT</div>

          <p>The article explores the growing trend of using AI chatbots for mental health support, highlighting both potential benefits and risks. While some users find chatbots helpful for coping strategies and immediate support, experts raise concerns about biases, limitations, lack of safeguarding, and data security. The article cites examples of chatbots providing harmful advice and the lack of human connection that is essential for counselling. Some users with autism have found it helpful because they are not great with in-person interaction, and find speaking to a computer is much better. The article ultimately suggests that chatbots can be a useful stopgap in an overloaded mental health system, but cannot fully replace human therapists.</p>
