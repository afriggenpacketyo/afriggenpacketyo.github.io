          <p>Qualcomm's fiscal second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by robust chip sales growth. The company's automotive and Internet of Things sectors also experienced significant growth, signaling successful diversification efforts. However, Qualcomm's revenue forecast for the current quarter was slightly below expectations, causing shares to decline in extended trading. CEO Cristiano Amon emphasized the company's diversified global supply chain and experience in navigating uncertainty, while CFO Akash Palkhiwala noted no material impact from tariffs.

          <p>Ted Johnson, a former New England Patriots linebacker, has suggested that North Carolina should consider parting ways with Bill Belichick due to the scrutiny surrounding Belichick's relationship and recent awkward interviews. Johnson expressed concerns about Belichick's fitness to coach college students, citing questionable decision-making related to his personal life. Johnson highlighted an email released by Belichick's girlfriend and her presence at spring practice as examples of decisions that reflect poorly on both Belichick and the university.

          <p>On April 30, 1975, the Fall of Saigon marked the end of the Vietnam War and the beginning of a mass evacuation effort. American pilots orchestrated the largest helicopter evacuation in history, extracting hundreds of Americans and thousands of Vietnamese from the besieged city. The operation, fraught with danger due to North Vietnamese shelling and infiltration, involved shuttling helicopters between ships and shore, including the U.S. Embassy, which was under siege by a panicked crowd. Ambassador Graham Martin was eventually ordered to leave, signaling the end of the war, and the remaining Marines were evacuated, marking the completion of the American withdrawal.</p>

The Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats, but the Conservatives also made significant gains, preventing the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.

          <p>Eleven New York state high school athletes accused of a hazing prank involving a gun and traumatizing their lacrosse teammates have turned themselves in to authorities. The incident involved younger players being driven to the woods, where one was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a car. The Onondaga County District Attorney had ordered the players to surrender within 48 hours, and they will face misdemeanour charges of unlawful imprisonment. The team's lacrosse season has been cancelled, and the school district is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin stated that it is up to the residents of Volgograd to decide whether the city should revert to the name of Stalingrad, as it was known during World War Two. The issue has been raised ahead of commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. Putin said the idea was "logical" given the historical significance of the battle but emphasized the need to consider the residents' opinions. He issued a decree renaming Volgograd airport Stalingrad to commemorate the Soviet victory.</p>

The meeting included the health secretary repeating a debunked conspiracy theory about migrant children and allegations concerning the Biden-era health and human services department. Trump also addressed the bleak economic data and trade war with China, suggesting that children might receive fewer Christmas dolls as a result.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that egg prices are falling, but some food economists dispute this, stating that retail egg prices have climbed during his term. While wholesale egg prices have dropped, economists say this decline has not yet translated into relief for consumers. Experts also reject the notion that any president has significant control over egg prices, attributing changes to factors like bird flu and consumer demand. Trump has repeatedly overstated the decline in wholesale egg prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first 100 days have seen a rapid pace of executive actions with little pushback from Congress, which has enacted a historically low number of laws. This has allowed Trump to legislate through executive actions, ignore statutes, and upend the economy with tariffs. Some in Congress have expressed concerns about the overreach of executive power, but GOP leaders have largely supported the president. Congressional scholars worry about the decline of Congress as a co-equal branch of government and a check on executive power.</p>
