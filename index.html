          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to address protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles, siding with Gov. Gavin Newsom's claim that the move was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Newsom, arguing that Trump did not follow the proper procedure for federalizing the troops. The ruling is temporarily on hold pending an appeal by the Trump administration. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed the emergency request, calling Trump's actions an unlawful militarization of the state. </p>

          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel launched airstrikes targeting locations in Iran related to its nuclear program, prompting Defense Minister Israel Katz to declare a state of emergency. Katz warned of potential missile and drone attacks against Israel, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would continue until the threat is removed. Iranian state media reported multiple fatalities in Tehran, and the United States stated they were not involved but were briefed beforehand, prioritizing the protection of American forces in the region. The President's national security team assembled in the White House Situation Room to monitor the strikes. The optimism score reflects the severity of the situation and potential for escalation. </p>

          <p>The owner of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic and his sister were arrested following a roof collapse in April that resulted in 236 deaths. Authorities have accused Antonio and Maribel Espaillat of negligence and irresponsibility for failing to prevent the collapse. Prosecutors also allege the Espaillats attempted to intimidate potential witnesses. The Attorney General's Office stated the defendants displayed immense irresponsibility and negligence by failing to physically intervene to prevent the club's roof from collapsing, as it ultimately did, causing 236 deaths and more than 180 injuries. The club was known for its Monday night merengue parties, attracting celebrities and high-profile Dominicans.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. Archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes analyzed early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The study indicates that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This contrasts with a 2017 study suggesting pigs were introduced to northern Europe from the Middle East around 4500 BC. </p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike, protesting what they deem unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals announced the vote, giving leaders the authority to call a strike. A walkout would significantly disrupt two of the nation’s largest grocery chains during a peak season. Negotiations are scheduled to resume on June 25, with staffing levels being a key point of contention. </p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the consolidation of US wildland firefighting forces into a single program, despite warnings about potential costs and disruptions. The order aims to centralize efforts currently split among multiple agencies, creating a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department. Critics argue the move could increase the risk of catastrophic fires during peak season. The order does not mention climate change, despite its role in fueling larger wildfires. </p>
