          <p>The president of the University of Virginia, James E. Ryan, has resigned after the Trump administration demanded his removal over the institution's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The pressure stems from a Justice Department probe into the university's DEI programs, which the administration aims to eliminate nationwide. Ryan stated he chose not to fight the federal government to save his job, citing the potential negative impact on employees and students. The move has been praised by conservative groups but condemned by Democratic senators as an outrageous example of "culture war" interference in higher education.</p>

          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats and business leaders are now strategizing to prevent his victory in the general election, with some considering backing an independent candidate. In contrast, progressive figures like former Mayor Bill de Blasio argue Mamdani's platform represents the majority view in the city. Mamdani is actively engaging with concerned business executives, aiming to bridge the gap and present a unified vision for New York's future.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the conflict between Israel and Iran. The author, Gary Nunn, suggests that while unconventional for a president, the moment felt authentic and effectively conveyed a frustration shared by many people. The piece argues that the public is tired of overly polished and scripted political speech, and that judicious, genuine use of strong language can make politicians seem more human and trustworthy. It posits that breaking linguistic norms can sometimes be a powerful tool for communication, even if it masks other political complexities.</p>

          <p>Americans celebrating the Fourth of July may face higher prices and shortages of fireworks due to the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese imports. The U.S. relies on China for nearly all of its consumer and professional fireworks, which are now subject to significant import taxes. Industry experts anticipate product shortages and advise consumers to shop early, while some importers have had to raise prices multiple times. The tariffs also create uncertainty for the industry's plans for the nation's 250th birthday celebration in 2026, which is expected to be a massive year for sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unexpectedly deferred its decision on a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case questions whether a new map with a second majority-Black district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, a map the state legislature claims was a political move to protect incumbents. This delay has puzzled legal experts, who are watching to see if the conservative-majority court will further weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The outcome could significantly impact protections against racial discrimination and the dilution of minority voting power nationwide.</p>

          <p>In response to intensified Russian airstrikes, Ukraine is ramping up its use of interceptor drones as a key defense strategy. Russia has significantly increased its deployment of Shahed drones, which now fly at higher altitudes, making them difficult for traditional mobile air defense to counter. Experts warn that without an effective response, Ukraine's infrastructure and defense systems are at risk. Interceptor drones offer a more cost-effective and efficient solution for targeting these threats compared to expensive anti-aircraft missiles, prompting Ukraine to accelerate domestic production and pilot training.</p>
