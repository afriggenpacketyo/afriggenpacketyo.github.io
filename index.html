        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews the history of meetings between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, highlighting their different diplomatic styles and the major outcomes of past encounters. Experts note Putin's calculated, power-focused approach, often using long monologues, contrasting with Trump's more freewheeling and relationship-driven style. The analysis suggests these dynamics will be crucial in their upcoming Alaska summit, where Trump aims to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, with former aides warning that Putin may try to manipulate the situation to his advantage.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, is defending his proposal to open five city-operated grocery stores, one in each borough. He asserts that the plan is not meant to oppose private grocery and bodega owners but to create a "public option" that can increase competition and lower food prices for New Yorkers. Mamdani envisions a partnership with existing store owners, helping them with issues like rent and insurance, while addressing food affordability. The proposal has drawn criticism from business owners and economists who fear it represents a move toward socialism.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has reached an agreement to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth in a deal that could be worth up to a club-record £42.5 million. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London. Ouattara reportedly sought a move after not having a prominent role at Bournemouth, where he scored nine goals in 37 appearances last season. The signing comes after Brentford's previous bid for another winger, Omari Hutchinson, was rejected by Ipswich.</p>

Authorities have linked the pair to a cult-like group known as the Zizians, which has been connected to multiple deaths across three states.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows in China's major cities, smaller county-level markets are becoming a crucial engine for consumption. Residents in these lower-tier areas often have lighter financial burdens and greater confidence, leading to stronger purchasing power and a willingness to spend on items like imported goods and electric vehicles. Experts suggest this "consumption upgrade" in previously overlooked regions is vital for China's goal of shifting toward a consumption-driven economy. This trend highlights a significant, untapped potential within the country's vast domestic market.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped significantly after the company issued a disappointing financial forecast for the current quarter.

          <p>A federal judge has struck down two directives from the Trump administration that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and universities. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions with DEI programs. The ruling found that the administration's guidance, which framed DEI as discriminatory, constituted a "sea change" in regulation that was implemented without following proper procedures, thereby chilling constitutionally protected speech among educators.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing about its long-term financial stability. According to projections, the program's trust funds will be depleted by 2033, at which point it will only be able to pay about 77% of scheduled benefits from incoming payroll taxes. Lawmakers are debating potential solutions, including a bipartisan proposal to create a new $1.5 trillion investment fund to cover the shortfall. Other plans focus on increasing taxes on high earners to ensure the program's solvency for future generations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged two men in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded investors, including military veterans, of over $200 million. Ryan Wear is accused of selling investors water vending machines that often did not exist and using money from new investors to pay returns to earlier ones. A second man, former fund manager Jordan Chirico, is charged with investing client money into the fraudulent company while concealing his personal financial stake in it. Both men face criminal charges from the DOJ and civil charges from the SEC.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending a more aggressive approach to treatment. Under the new advice, medication is now recommended for individuals with systolic pressure in the 130-139 range if lifestyle changes alone are not effective after three to six months. The guidelines also shift from recommending moderate alcohol consumption to suggesting complete abstinence due to evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. The changes emphasize early intervention to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia.</p>

          <p>From the Ukrainian perspective, the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is viewed with deep apprehension and disappointment. The article highlights a feeling of being let down by an ally, as Trump's diplomatic efforts are seen as naive and poorly prepared, particularly his reliance on inexperienced advisors. Ukrainians fear that any deal reached in Alaska will ultimately serve Putin's goal of undermining their country's sovereignty, as they believe Trump fundamentally misunderstands the conflict's nature.</p>

          <p>A multinational effort to airdrop food into Gaza provides some relief but underscores the severe humanitarian crisis caused by Israel's near-total blockade. The article details the complex and costly process of dropping aid from cargo planes, which is far less efficient than overland truck deliveries that have been largely blocked. On the ground, the drops create a desperate scramble for supplies, with many, particularly the elderly and weak, unable to secure any food. Residents and aid organizations criticize the airdrops as a chaotic and inadequate solution to what they describe as deliberate starvation.</p>

          <p>This article examines the divergent goals of U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of their Alaska summit. For Putin, the meeting itself is a victory, signifying a failure of Western efforts to isolate him and offering a chance to solidify territorial gains in Ukraine. Conversely, Trump is driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker, though his vacillating statements have created uncertainty about his specific objectives. While Putin seeks strategic advantages, Trump appears focused on securing a legacy-defining deal to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>According to Norwegian media, Donald Trump made an unsolicited phone call to Norway's finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. The report, citing unnamed sources, claims the call was "out of the blue" and that Trump also wanted to discuss tariffs. Stoltenberg confirmed a call took place regarding economic cooperation but declined to elaborate on its full content. Trump has frequently complained about not receiving the prestigious award, which is decided by a five-member committee appointed by Norway's parliament.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico legislature, was sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic officials. The attacks occurred after Peña lost his 2022 election by a wide margin, which he baselessly claimed was "rigged." No one was injured in the shootings, but prosecutors argued Peña intended to terrorize political opponents and cause political change through violence. The case is a stark example of the rise in political violence following the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price increased by 7% following a report that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The potential investment would help fund Intel's new factories in Ohio, aligning with the administration's goal of bringing more high-tech production to the U.S. Intel is the only American company capable of manufacturing the most advanced chips domestically. The move would represent another instance of the U.S. government taking direct equity stakes in key industries to advance national security and economic priorities. (not investment advice)</p>
