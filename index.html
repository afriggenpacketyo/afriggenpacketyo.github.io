        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years, citing Iran's failure to fully cooperate with the agency regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities. In response, Iran condemned the resolution as "political" and announced plans to establish a new uranium enrichment facility at a secure location and replace existing centrifuges with more advanced models. The IAEA's board of governors expressed deep regret over Iran's lack of cooperation, raising concerns about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. This development could complicate talks between Tehran and Washington on a new nuclear agreement, as tensions continue to mount in the Middle East. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further escalation. </p>

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, en route to London, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, resulting in reported casualties. The incident marks the first fatal crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, raising questions about the safety of the aircraft model. Boeing has stated it is in contact with Air India and stands ready to support them, while shares of Boeing experienced a significant drop in pre-market trading. The crash comes amid previous investigations and whistleblower allegations regarding assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner, though it is currently unclear if these issues are linked to the crash.

          <p>The Air India plane crash involving a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner has reignited concerns regarding the safety of Boeing aircraft. This is the first crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, and it follows a series of safety issues for Boeing, including past investigations and lawsuits related to its 737 Max jetliners. Boeing has stated it is ready to support Air India, but the incident has led to a decline in Boeing's stock value. The aircraft involved in the crash had logged over 41,000 hours of flying time, and the investigation will likely focus on whether previous concerns about assembly defects played a role.

In contrast, Addison Rae's debut album, Addison, is praised for its blend of electronic experimentalism and pop sensibilities, evoking artists like Aphex Twin and Madonna. Rae's album is seen as a throwback to a time when pop didn't insist on its own importance, highlighting the craftsmanship required to create a hit. Rae's approach is refreshing. </p>

Key songs like "Stand!" and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" showcased his ability to blend celebration with darker lyrical themes.

          <p>The Trump administration's plan for a parade honoring the 250th birthday of the United States Army is criticized for celebrating power rather than service. The display of military hardware is seen as outdated and irrelevant to current strategic priorities, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. The administration is faulted for undermining the country's scientific strengths by neglecting research universities. The article argues that a more appropriate parade would honor the Army's history, values, and diverse composition, including units representing Black and Native American soldiers. This approach would better reflect the Army's role as a great equalizer. </p>

          <p>The State Department has restricted travel for U.S. government workers in Israel and authorized family members of U.S. military personnel across the Middle East to evacuate, amid concerns of a potential Israeli strike on Iran. This comes as Iran announced plans to significantly boost its uranium enrichment program in response to an IAEA resolution finding Tehran in non-compliance with its nuclear obligations. Despite the threat of military action, Iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful. These actions underscore escalating tensions in the region. </p>

          <p>President Trump's increasingly negative tone regarding nuclear talks with Iran and the withdrawal of some American personnel from the Middle East have raised geopolitical concerns. Trump has warned that the U.S. or Israel could carry out airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities if negotiations fail. The IAEA Board of Governors has declared Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations. Despite ongoing talks, the potential for military conflict between Israel and Iran remains a significant concern. The situation is volatile. </p>
