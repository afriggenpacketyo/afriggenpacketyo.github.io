        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources indicate that former President Trump has privately voiced his discontent with his Supreme Court picks, primarily Justice Amy Coney Barrett, feeling they aren't sufficiently supporting his agenda. Allies have echoed these sentiments, with some publicly criticizing Barrett's decisions. Despite these private complaints, Trump has not publicly attacked Barrett, even defending her after she sided with liberal justices on a foreign aid payment ruling. Trump also recently criticized Leonard Leo, who advised him on judicial nominations, expressing disappointment with the Federalist Society's recommendations. The article reflects a potential rift between Trump and some of his judicial appointees. Optimism is tempered by the reported discord and the potential implications for future judicial nominations.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will not attend a key meeting to coordinate military aid to Ukraine, marking the first time the U.S. has been absent since the group's formation in 2022. This decision follows warnings from French President Emmanuel Macron about the risks of prioritizing potential conflicts with China at the expense of supporting Ukraine. Hegseth's absence and lack of new military aid announcements signal a potential shift in U.S. policy towards Ukraine under the Trump administration. A Ukrainian delegation is in Washington for talks on defense, sanctions, and postwar recovery, while General Christopher Cavoli will attend the aid meeting in Hegseth's place.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren's office has published a report chronicling Elon Musk's "130 days" serving in the Trump administration, accusing him of exploiting his position to benefit himself and his businesses. The report alleges that Musk engaged in numerous questionable actions, raising concerns about corruption, ethics, and conflicts of interest during his leadership of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). Warren's team claims Musk violated norms at an "astonishing pace", calling his behavior scandalous, irrespective of legal repercussions. Musk's tenure leading DOGE was marked by significant changes to the federal workforce and government agencies.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors allege that Demetric DeShawn Scott, an inmate, forged threatening letters about President Trump to get Ramon Morales-Reyes, a witness in his upcoming trial, deported. Scott hoped that Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant, would be deported, leading to the dismissal of his criminal trial for alleged armed robbery and battery against Morales-Reyes. Morales-Reyes was arrested outside a Milwaukee school based on the forged letters, but investigators later determined that Scott was the actual author. A lawyer for Morales-Reyes said that he had applied for a U visa, which is available for people in the U.S. illegally who are victims of certain crimes.</p>

          <p>The USDA has temporarily halted its request for states to hand over sensitive data about SNAP recipients after a lawsuit was filed alleging the directive violated federal privacy laws. The USDA's demand included names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses of people who had applied for or received SNAP benefits over the past five years. The agency cited President Trump's executive order calling for "unfettered access" to data from state programs receiving federal funds. A coalition of SNAP recipients and advocacy groups sued the USDA, arguing the request was unlawful and lacked proper procedures for data collection, prompting the agency to pause its data request.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a decline in extended trading after the company issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast, despite surpassing earnings expectations for the fiscal first quarter. The company's revenue increased by nearly 20%, but costs also rose due to increased spending in sales and marketing, research and development, and administration, partly related to a software outage last summer. While CrowdStrike raised its full-year earnings guidance, it maintained its revenue expectations, leading to investor concerns.

          <p>The England women's football team experienced a week of mixed results, including a dominant win against Portugal and a loss to Spain in the Nations League. Manager Wiegman dealt with challenges including the retirement of Mary Earps and the withdrawal of Millie Bright. The team's response against Portugal was impressive, with Aggie Beever-Jones scoring a hat-trick. Despite the loss to Spain, the team gained valuable experience and fitness for key players, with the Euros squad announcement approaching.</p>

          <p>The UK has been exempted from President Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. While the order raises import taxes for U.S. firms buying from other countries, the levy remains at 25% for the UK. A UK-US tariff pact signed in May will eventually eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum, but it has not yet taken effect. The UK government remains committed to protecting British businesses and jobs in key sectors.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that FEMA is in disarray as hurricane season begins, with concerns about its preparedness and leadership. The acting FEMA head reportedly demonstrated a lack of awareness about hurricane season, though DHS denies this. Internal documents suggest FEMA is behind schedule and not fully prepared, despite claims of being 80-85% ready. The agency has faced staff cuts and program reductions, raising questions about its ability to respond effectively to disasters.

          <p>A U.S. judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care to transgender inmates, despite an executive order by President Trump to halt funding for such care. The ruling allows a group of over 2,000 transgender inmates to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order. The judge ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide hormone therapy and accommodations, but not surgical care. The decision was based on the likelihood that the inmates would succeed in their lawsuit, as the bureau did not analyze the impact of cutting off previously deemed medically appropriate treatments.</p>
