          <p>Former President Trump announced a plan to address crime and homelessness in Washington, D.C., stating that homeless individuals must be moved "IMMEDIATELY" to locations "FAR from the Capital." The threat follows an alleged assault on a former administration staffer and includes suggestions of a federal takeover of the city's policing. This comes despite local police data showing that violent crime in D.C. has been declining for over a year and is currently down 26% compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's first competitive match under new manager Arne Slot, a Community Shield loss to Crystal Palace, offered a glimpse into the team's future. Four new signings, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, showed attacking flair, with two debutants scoring goals. However, the performance also exposed significant defensive frailties and a tendency to concede goals from limited chances, indicating that while the team has high potential, there are clear issues to resolve as the season begins.</p>

          <p>Dr. Avi Loeb, a physicist at Harvard University, has proposed that a massive interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, might be an alien probe on a reconnaissance mission. He points to its highly unusual characteristics, including a statistically improbable trajectory that aligns closely with the orbits of several planets in our solar system. Loeb also noted its unexpected glow, which appears in front of the object rather than as a traditional comet tail, as further evidence of its anomalous nature.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly refuted allegations from Chinese state-affiliated media that its H20 artificial intelligence chips contain hardware "backdoors" that pose a national security risk. The claims are part of escalating semiconductor tensions between the U.S. and China, with Beijing attempting to frame the H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market under U.S. export controls, as inferior and unsafe. Nvidia maintains that cybersecurity is a top priority and its chips have no such vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a stunning 13% rally last week, a move largely attributed to a massive short squeeze rather than fundamental news. Investors who had bet against the company, citing its perceived lack of an AI strategy and regulatory risks, were forced to buy shares to cover their positions, driving the price up dramatically. This surge in a single mega-cap stock significantly lifted major market averages, masking underlying weakness in many other parts of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as U.S. Surgeon General during the first Trump administration, has sharply condemned the response of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the fatal shooting at the CDC. Adams described the secretary's statement as "tepid" and accused him of fanning the flames of hostility with past anti-vaccine rhetoric. He also strongly defended mRNA vaccine technology, which Kennedy recently moved to defund, calling it one of former President Trump's greatest achievements.</p>

          <p>Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has publicly criticized former President Trump for reportedly considering a reclassification of marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. On social media, Kirk expressed his opposition, stating a need to "protect public spaces for kids" and complaining that "everything already smells like weed." The potential policy shift would ease federal restrictions on the substance, a move that aligns with efforts initiated during the previous administration.</p>

          <p>A protest in London in support of Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws, resulted in 532 arrests. The majority were arrested for displaying placards supporting the group, which is now a criminal offense. The mass arrests, the largest by London's Metropolitan Police in a decade, have sparked a debate over free speech, with Amnesty International calling the broad application of terror laws "deeply concerning," while the government defended its decision.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine, fulfilling a key but unrealized campaign promise from Trump. The summit was announced after a U.S.-imposed deadline for a ceasefire passed, with reports suggesting a potential deal could involve territorial swaps. However, Ukraine has adamantly rejected any agreement that cedes its land, stating that any decisions made without its participation will be "dead decisions."</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid a moving tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who he portrayed in the 1995 film "Apollo 13." Following Lovell's death at age 97, Hanks praised him as a man who dared to lead others to places they wouldn't go on their own, fueled by challenge rather than a desire for fame. Hanks immortalized Lovell's famous line, "Houston, we've had a problem," in the Oscar-winning film depicting the perilous but ultimately successful mission.</p>
