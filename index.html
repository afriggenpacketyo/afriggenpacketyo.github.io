          <p>North Korea successfully relaunched a 5,000-ton warship after a previous failed launch in May.  Leader Kim Jong Un addressed the incident, calling the initial failure a serious criminal act and ordering a thorough investigation.  Several shipyard officials were arrested as a result.  Despite the setback, Kim reaffirmed his commitment to building a modern naval force.</p>
