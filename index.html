          <p>Republican attempts to impeach judges for rulings against President Trump's deportation efforts are criticized as theatrics or intimidation.  The focus is on Judge Boasberg's scrutiny of Trump's actions under the 1798 Enemy Aliens Act, with critics arguing Congress should address the issue legislatively rather than through impeachment.  The debate highlights the tension between executive and judicial power.</p>
