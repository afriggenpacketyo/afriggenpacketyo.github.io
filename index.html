          <p>In an interview, President Trump addressed concerns about whether he needs to uphold the Constitution by stating that he relies on his lawyers to follow Supreme Court rulings. He also reiterated his desire for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, claiming Powell's reluctance stems from personal dislike. Trump clarified that he does not plan to remove Powell before his term ends in 2026, as he will soon have the opportunity to replace him anyway. The president emphasized the need for lower interest rates to boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is pursuing the incorporation of its launch site in Cameron County, Texas, into a self-governing city named Starbase, which has garnered significant local opposition. While a preliminary vote showed overwhelming support for the incorporation, residents voice concerns about SpaceX's increasing control over the area, including potential restrictions to public access to Boca Chica Beach. The proposed municipality would have the power to create its own fire department, emergency services, and even a school district. Locals fear the environmental impact of frequent rocket launches and the disruption to their traditional way of life, particularly access to the beach. Bekah Hinojosa, who leads a local environmental group, told ABC News that SpaceX has disrupted everyday life in the area.</p>

          <p>California's ambitious high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled cost estimates, leading to questions about the state's ability to complete large-scale infrastructure projects. An eminent-domain lawyer, Mark Wasser, disputes claims that land acquisition is the primary cause of delays, arguing that construction proceeds while compensation negotiations continue. The planned route cuts through valuable farmland, disrupting agricultural operations and leaving unusable remnants. Farmers express frustration with the project's impact on their livelihoods, with some doubting the rail line will ever be completed in their lifetime.</p>

The Maltese Prime Minister stated that repairs would be considered once authorities confirm the ship carries only humanitarian aid, and has insisted on inspecting the vessel before docking.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students $2,000 a year. Supporters of the bill, including President Trump, hail it as a victory for students and parents, while Democrats argue it will harm public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private education. Democrats believe the legislation hurts public schools.</p>

          <p>Romania's hard-right nationalist leader, George Simion, who is critical of the EU, is in the lead in the first round of a presidential election held Sunday in the EU and NATO member country. Simion's campaign is counting on support from disgruntled Georgescu voters concerned not only by high inflation and the increasing cost of living in the European Union country, but now also influenced by populist conspiracy theories regarding the cancelation of the original vote. Simion, who opposes military aid to Ukraine and is critical of European Union leadership, says he's aligned with the US President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement. The election was rerun due to widespread concerns over Russian interference in favor of far-right Calin Georgescu.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions in office reflect a radical expansion of executive power, drawing from legal and philosophical traditions that favor monarchical and dictatorial rule. Thinkers like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and Adrian Vermeule provide the intellectual basis for this approach, which prioritizes decisive action by the executive without constraints from bureaucracy or other branches of government. The article argues that this expansive view of executive power threatens the separation of powers and risks transforming the American presidency into a dictatorial office. It calls for a renewed emphasis on personal character and adherence to constitutional limits to safeguard against tyranny.</p>

          <p>An Ohio man, Rodney Hinton Jr., was charged with aggravated murder after allegedly hitting and killing a sheriff's deputy with a car, a day after his 18-year-old son, Ryan Hinton, was fatally shot by police. Prosecutors allege the father deliberately attacked law enforcement after his son was shot to death by police. The incident occurred while the deputy was directing traffic outside a University of Cincinnati graduation. Hours before the attack, Mr. Hinton and his family watched police footage of his son's shooting, leaving him "understandably distraught."</p>

          <p>Following a lackluster fight between Saúl Álvarez and William Scull, questions arise about the entertainment value of Canelo's future bouts, including a scheduled match against Terence Crawford. Experts and fans expressed disappointment with the Scull fight, where Álvarez pursued a defensive opponent. Crawford, though considered one of the best pound-for-pound boxers, will be moving up two weight divisions to challenge Álvarez, leading to concerns about the disparity in size and strength. Julio César Chávez predicted Álvarez would knock out Crawford, drawing parallels to Amir Khan's fight against Canelo, where weight differences proved decisive.</p>

The conflict escalated when the state's library board paused funding to the library, demanding certain books be moved to the adult section. This decision has sparked a heated divide, pitting those who demand censorship against those who champion intellectual freedom. The fight highlights broader tensions between the city's progressive roots and its current conservative leanings.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was "increasing the pressure" with the aim of returning hostages held in Gaza and defeating Hamas militants. Critics say the recent military offensive, after a ceasefire broke down, has failed to guarantee the release of captives, and question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives in the conflict.
