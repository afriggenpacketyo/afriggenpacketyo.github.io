          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a two-year low of 3.85% due to receding inflation concerns. Recent data indicates a four-year low inflation rate of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025, providing the RBA room to ease monetary policy. While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range of 2-3%, it acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook. Analysts have highlighted potential downside risks from global trade tensions and domestic economic uncertainty, prompting forecasts of further dovish actions from the RBA.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners. However, these agreements required politically sensitive concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished position in the post-Brexit era. While the deals offer benefits such as easier travel to the EU and reduced tariffs on British cars in the US, they come at a cost, including allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters and granting greater access to American agricultural products. This article analyzes the implications of these trade-offs for Britain's economy and its relationship with global trading blocs.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver has been charged with allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers outside of an ICE detention facility. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges, stating McIver assaulted and impeded a law enforcement officer during a protest outside Delaney Hall. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem supports the decision. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka's charges were dropped, and he voiced support for McIver. Top House Democrats condemned the charges as an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump. This influx of capital contrasts with market concerns surrounding rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this trend indicates a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets. The Bank of America noted that a weaker US dollar, peaking US bond yields, and China's economic recovery are driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>
