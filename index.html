          <p>A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder following remarks he made at an anti-racism rally in Walthamstow. During the event, Jones referred to far-right demonstrators as "disgusting Nazi fascists" and called for them to be gotten rid of. The 58-year-old Dartford councillor, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, maintained that his comments were ill-advised but not intended to incite violence. A jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court cleared him of the charge after a trial where his speech was presented as evidence.</p>

          <p>International negotiators in Geneva have failed to finalize a landmark treaty aimed at curbing the global plastic pollution crisis. The talks stalled over fundamental disagreements, particularly whether to impose legally binding caps on new plastic production, a measure opposed by oil-producing nations and the plastics industry. Despite significant progress being made, the 183 participating countries could not agree on a final text, adjourning the session to be resumed at a later, undetermined date. Environmental and health advocates expressed deep disappointment, emphasizing the urgent need for a comprehensive approach that addresses the entire lifecycle of plastics.</p>

Jota's family is expected to be in attendance at Anfield for the emotional occasion, which will feature a moment of silence, a fan-led mosaic, and players wearing shirts with a 'Forever 20' emblem. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt for the season in consultation with his family. The tribute underscores the profound impact Jota had on the club and the broader football community.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is strengthening in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become the season's first hurricane. With maximum sustained winds reaching 70 mph, just shy of the 74 mph hurricane threshold, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate it will intensify into a major hurricane by the weekend. The storm's current path is projected to move near or north of the Leeward Islands, though its long-term trajectory toward the U.S. remains uncertain. Erin is the fifth named storm of what is predicted to be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>A legal and jurisdictional conflict has erupted between the U.S. Attorney General and Washington D.C.'s local government over control of the city's police force. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb has declared an order from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to be "unlawful," advising the police chief she is not obligated to follow it. The federal order sought to rescind D.C.'s sanctuary city policies and place the police under the authority of an emergency commissioner. This confrontation highlights the escalating tensions between the Trump administration's efforts to assert federal control and the city's assertion of its home rule authority.</p>

The piece challenges political leaders, particularly Democrats, to move beyond simple solutions like universal basic income and instead develop large-scale programs that provide displaced workers with dignity and purpose through meaningful service-oriented work. It frames the management of this transition as the paramount political test of our era.</p>

          <p>President Trump's justification for a federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force, and potential interventions in other cities, is based on claims of high crime that are contradicted by data. Criminal justice experts and FBI statistics indicate that violent crime rates are actually experiencing a significant nationwide decrease, reversing a spike seen during the pandemic. Elected officials from cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have pushed back against Trump's narrative, pointing to their own data showing public safety improvements. Critics argue the president's focus on crime is political theater, using a false premise to assert federal authority over Democratic-led cities.</p>

          <p>The director of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya, is facing condemnation from public health experts for defending the termination of $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research. Bhattacharya argued in an op-ed that the technology failed to "earn public trust," a justification critics find audacious, given their view that he and other Trump administration officials actively sowed public doubt about vaccines. Experts like Dr. Paul Offit argue that the focus should be on the proven safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, which saved millions of lives, rather than on politicized perceptions of public trust. The move is seen by some as part of a concerning pattern of undermining established science.</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska, their approaches to ending the war in Ukraine are shaped by starkly different goals. Russia seeks to solidify its territorial gains, secure Ukraine's neutrality, and diminish U.S. influence, potentially by presenting a peace plan that appears favorable but ultimately benefits Moscow. Conversely, Ukraine demands a full withdrawal of Russian forces from its internationally recognized borders and has rejected any notion of trading land for peace. European allies are watching cautiously, concerned that President Trump might agree to a deal that undermines Ukraine's sovereignty and European security, making the summit a critical juncture for the conflict.</p>

Döpfner calls for Germany to overcome its historical reluctance and assume a leadership role, particularly in strengthening Europe's economy, energy independence, and defense capabilities.

          <p>The modern cultural and scientific fascination with Mars, including ambitions to establish a human colony there, has roots in a significant astronomical misunderstanding from the late 19th century. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observation of linear features he called "canali" (channels) was mistranslated into English as "canals," sparking widespread belief in an intelligent Martian civilization. This theory, popularized by astronomer Percival Lowell, captured the public imagination for decades, suggesting a cooperative, advanced society. Although later proven to be an optical illusion, this era of belief in Martians inspired generations of scientists and writers, helping to lay the cultural groundwork for humanity's ongoing quest to reach the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>A proposed California law, AB 597, intended to regulate public insurance adjusters and protect disaster victims from exploitation, is facing strong criticism from a leading consumer advocacy group. The bill, sponsored by the Department of Insurance, would change how adjusters calculate their fees after a catastrophe, basing compensation only on funds recovered after they are hired. Opponents, including United Policyholders, argue this will force adjusters to charge much higher contingency rates, potentially discouraging fire victims from seeking professional help and ultimately reducing their claim payouts. The debate highlights the tension between preventing fraud and ensuring homeowners can effectively navigate complex insurance claims.</p>

          <p>A research team from Tsinghua University in China has developed a groundbreaking new approach to the "single-source shortest-paths" problem, a fundamental challenge in theoretical computer science. For decades, the dominant method was limited by a sorting process inherent in Dijkstra's algorithm. The new method bypasses this sorting step, instead focusing only on the most critical points in a network, which significantly reduces calculation time and breaks a long-standing speed barrier. This innovative work earned the researchers the Best Paper Award at the prestigious ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing.</p>

          <p>Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, has launched a sharp critique of USA Swimming, citing "weak" leadership and years of organizational drift. He expressed concern over the program's declining competitive performance, noting a drop in the share of Olympic medals won by Team USA since 2016. Phelps, along with other swimming greats like Ryan Lochte and Rowdy Gaines, is calling for an independent review and renewed investment ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. His criticism points to deep structural issues that he fears will prevent the sport from capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation opportunity of a home Games.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer is facing scrutiny over its fan code of conduct, which bans political displays and has led to several controversial incidents, including the removal of fans wearing MAGA hats and displaying anti-ICE banners. The policy, which prohibits advocating for or against political candidates or government actions, is intended to keep stadiums safe and apolitical. However, critics argue the rule is vague, inconsistently enforced, and fails to distinguish between partisan politics and human rights advocacy. The situation highlights the league's struggle to balance the norms of global soccer culture with those of major American sports.</p>

          <p>Residents of Denver Harbor, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Houston, are concerned that a proposed redistricting plan will dilute their political influence and leave their community's problems unaddressed. The new voting map would move the area from a Democratic-held district into one that is more suburban and Republican-leaning. Community members worry that their new representatives will be unresponsive to pressing local issues like air pollution from the nearby Ship Channel and the pervasive fear of immigration raids. The redistricting effort, which Republicans argue reflects demographic shifts, is seen by critics as a form of demographic manipulation.</p>

          <p>During the August recess, Republican members of Congress are facing constituents in town halls with carefully crafted talking points to defend President Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill." An NPR analysis of recent events reveals that lawmakers are adhering to messaging guidance from the National Republican Congressional Committee, focusing on popular provisions like tax cuts on tips and work requirements for Medicaid. Despite facing repeated and pointed questions from voters on controversial aspects like healthcare cuts and benefits for the wealthy, representatives have largely stuck to the prescribed script, highlighting the challenge the GOP faces in selling the complex legislation to the public.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has deployed the National Guard to Washington, D.C., legal experts suggest replicating this move in other major cities would be far more difficult. The president's authority over the capital is unique due to the 1973 Home Rule Act, which does not apply to states where governors command their own National Guard units. Although federal troops can be deployed to protect federal property, their use in domestic law enforcement is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. This legal framework, combined with a strong American tradition against military presence on city streets, presents significant obstacles to extending such interventions nationwide.</p>

          <p>Global oil prices experienced a slight downturn in early trading as investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of the high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate futures both saw modest declines, with markets anticipating that potential diplomatic outcomes could affect sanctions on Russian oil supply. In contrast, gold prices saw a slight increase as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst the geopolitical uncertainty. The currency markets also reacted, with the pound gaining against a weaker U.S. dollar, reflecting the broader market attentiveness to the summit's implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, set to begin this weekend if a deal is not reached. The airline initiated a gradual suspension of operations, starting with long-haul overseas flights, with a full grounding of its fleet expected by Saturday morning. This disruption threatens to affect approximately 130,000 travelers per day. The core issues in the contract dispute are wages and unpaid work time, with the union and the airline remaining far apart despite ongoing negotiations.</p>
