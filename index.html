          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities and increasing competition. The decline occurred even as overall electric car sales in Europe rose by 34.1%. Tesla's sales have been negatively impacted by protests at dealerships and an aging vehicle lineup, the company launched an upgraded version of its Model Y sports utility vehicle this year, but its overall line-up of cars is still ageing, with no new mass market offering unveiled to date. Meanwhile, competitors like BYD are surpassing Tesla in European electric car sales, and consumers are showing a preference for hybrid vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve.</p>

          <p>As Andrew Cuomo leads in the polls for New York City mayor, his rivals are strategically aligning him with the current mayor, Eric Adams, a comparison many New Yorkers view unfavorably. Critics argue that Cuomo, like Adams, is a moderate Democrat who favors pro-business policies and resists progressive agendas. Both men share similar donors, support charter schools, and advocate for aggressive policing tactics. While Cuomo emphasizes his superior management skills compared to Adams, opponents highlight the federal investigations both have faced, suggesting that electing Cuomo would simply perpetuate the status quo. The article discusses the increasing willingness of other mayoral candidates to lump the two together as examples of the unacceptable status quo.</p>

          <p>Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Sean Combs, is expected to testify at his racketeering and sex-trafficking trial, alleging she was twice kidnapped by Combs or his bodyguards. The testimony is intended to support racketeering conspiracy charges against Combs, accusing him of crimes dating back to 2004, including arson, drug violations, bribery, and obstruction of justice. Combs's lawyers deny the kidnapping accusations, asserting that Clark and another woman are not victims, but rather former girlfriends who willingly participated in consensual sexual activity. The article outlines the defense's strategy to undermine Clark's credibility by highlighting her past request to work for Combs again.</p>

          <p>UK food inflation has reached its highest annual rate in a year, driven by rising beef and fresh produce prices, according to industry data. Beef prices have increased due to high demand and low supply, exacerbated by a lack of government support for the farming industry. Fazenda, a steakhouse chain, has passed on about 2% of increased costs to customers, with beef prices up by approximately 20% in the last 12 months. Farming industry experts have warned that customers would eventually be hit by cost increases due to competition between supermarkets previously keeping prices down.</p>

          <p>Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, have been identified in the United States, with initial cases dating back to late March. Symptoms associated with NB.1.8.1 are similar to previous strains, including respiratory issues and systemic effects like fever and fatigue, and data suggests it is more transmissible but not more severe. Despite high transmissibility, the Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to certain groups, requiring vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. Experts express concerns about potential public health impacts, including delayed access to boosters and reduced vaccination rates, while emphasizing the importance of hygiene practices and mask-wearing for prevention.</p>

          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April year on year, reflecting Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. While India surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the U.S. in March, analysts expect this growth to slow due to manufacturing capacity limitations. Protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing could also curb India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity, with Trump threatening tariffs on all iPhone shipments if they are not manufactured domestically. The article analyzes the complexities of Apple's supply chain and the political factors influencing its manufacturing strategy.</p>

At least 11 people have been arrested for allegedly assisting the inmates, including a jail maintenance worker accused of disabling the toilet's water supply.

Polling data indicates that Young Gen Z holds more favorable views of Republicans and Trump compared to Old Gen Z. Younger members of Gen Z also exhibit more conservative views on policy issues and are more likely to identify with a religion, which correlates with Republican affiliation.

Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh suggested the change to ensure a definitive result, aiming to enhance fan engagement. The "golden point" format, where the first team to score wins, is already used in Super Rugby Pacific for regular season games, though knockout games use standard extra time periods before resorting to a golden point. In 2017, the Lions and New Zealand shared the series after a drawn third Test, leading to calls for a more decisive outcome.</p>

          <p>Following a car ramming incident in Liverpool, the Merseyside Police promptly released details about the driver, a 53-year-old white British man, to prevent the spread of misinformation. This decision contrasts with the aftermath of a stabbing in Southport last summer, where a lack of information led to false anti-Muslim speculation and subsequent riots. The police's swift action aimed to control the narrative and avoid the harmful consequences of unchecked rumors. However, some experts raise concerns about potential challenges in future cases where the suspect's background may be more sensitive.</p>
