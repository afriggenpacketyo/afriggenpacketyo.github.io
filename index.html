          <p>Former President Donald Trump is reportedly demanding a $230 million settlement from the Department of Justice as compensation for the criminal investigations he faced after his first term. According to The New York Times, this demand comes as he navigates various legal challenges, including those related to classified documents. Any potential settlement would be complex, as it might require approval from officials appointed during a potential second Trump administration, creating a unique political and legal situation. The claim positions the investigations as unjust and seeks significant financial restitution from the federal government.</p>

          <p>Amid mixed market performance during the third-quarter earnings season, the aerospace sector shows significant strength, buoying confidence in companies like Honeywell. This optimism is supported by RTX Corp's blowout earnings and increased full-year guidance, driven by high demand in its aerospace division. Conversely, the analysis suggests caution regarding Texas Roadhouse, which has been downgraded due to persistently high beef commodity prices that pressure its profit margins. The article advises investors to await a pullback before considering new positions in the steakhouse chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum, a criminologist predicts that French authorities will likely apprehend the suspects but may never recover the stolen crown jewels. The thieves left behind significant DNA evidence and tools, including a crane lift and power saw, which should aid the investigation into the heist that targeted the Galerie d'Apollon. Despite the likelihood of arrests, the expert fears the priceless historical artifacts will be dismantled and sold on the black market. The incident has raised serious questions about security at one of the world's most famous museums.</p>

In response, Musk posted sharp remarks on the social media platform X, questioning Duffy's qualifications.

          <p>Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can eliminate unsecured debts, is contingent on an individual's income relative to their state's median for a household of their size. This eligibility is determined through a "means test," which assesses income over the previous six months. If an individual's income is below the state median, they generally qualify automatically. However, if it is higher, they may still be eligible after a more detailed calculation that deducts allowable expenses like housing and taxes. For those who do not qualify, alternatives such as Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement programs are available.</p>

          <p>Middle East experts are urging the Trump administration to exclude the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) from any role in the reconstruction of Gaza as part of a new peace plan. Critics allege the agency is compromised due to its reported ties to Hamas and a history of perpetuating the refugee crisis rather than resolving it. They argue that UNRWA has lost its neutrality and that alternative channels, like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, could distribute aid more effectively without militant interference. In contrast, UNRWA defends its role as essential for humanitarian aid and denies the allegations as unsubstantiated.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that neglect likely contributed to the death of Cerys Lupton-Jones, a 22-year-old patient at a mental health unit in Manchester. The investigation revealed that staff at Park House falsified observation records, claiming she was safe just before she fatally harmed herself. CCTV footage showed that required 15-minute checks were missed, and a staff member admitted to falsifying the log. The coroner described the care as a "shambles" and concluded that the outcome may have been different if she had been properly monitored, prompting calls for a broader inquiry into the mental health trust.</p>

Proper fit is crucial to avoid undue stress on joints like knees and hips. It is recommended to start with a light weight, about 5% of body weight, and gradually increase usage.

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, known as Mango House, has developed a successful and self-sustaining business model by primarily serving Medicaid patients, a demographic often considered unprofitable. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic eliminated scheduled appointments in favor of an efficient walk-in system that keeps wait times short while seeing a high volume of patients. By streamlining operations, minimizing administrative overhead, and focusing on ease of access, the clinic remains financially viable without relying on grants. This innovative approach challenges conventional wisdom about the feasibility of providing care within the Medicaid system.</p>

          <p>The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv is experiencing a total power outage after a "massive" Russian assault involving over 100 drones and six ballistic missiles targeted its energy infrastructure. The attack is part of Russia's escalating campaign against civilian infrastructure across Ukraine, aiming to cripple energy supplies and the rail network. At least four people were killed in the wider region. The strike has also disrupted water supplies, forcing residents to rely on emergency deliveries. This bombardment intensifies concerns about Ukraine's energy resilience as winter approaches.</p>

          <p>Precious metals experienced a dramatic downturn as gold futures fell by as much as 5.5%, marking the largest single-day drop in over a decade. Silver futures also tumbled more than 7%, their steepest decline since 2021. The sharp sell-off is attributed to a combination of factors, including easing US-China trade tensions, a strengthening US dollar, and technical indicators suggesting the metals were overbought after a significant rally. Despite the sharp correction, some analysts believe the long-term bullish case for gold remains intact due to persistent inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge denied motions from the companies to prevent their top executives from testifying, stating that a CEO's knowledge of potential harms is uniquely relevant to the case. The lawsuit alleges that social media companies designed addictive features that cause compulsive behavior in minors without adequate warnings.

          <p>A planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been called off, with the White House stating there are no plans for a summit in the "immediate future." The talks, which were expected to take place in Budapest, were intended to address the war in Ukraine. However, significant differences between the U.S. and Russian positions on a peace deal appear to have stalled progress. Russia continues to insist on a full Ukrainian withdrawal from eastern regions, while the U.S. and European allies support freezing the conflict along the current front lines.</p>

However, some former Israeli officials express skepticism, suggesting the agreement was signed under duress and that its long-term viability is uncertain due to a lack of trust and good faith between the parties.</p>

          <p>Israel is reportedly taking steps to de-register major international non-governmental aid organizations (INGOs), threatening their ability to operate in Gaza and the West Bank. According to aid officials, new registration criteria include approval from a committee that considers factors like "inciting racism," which they fear is being broadly applied. This move follows Israel's ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) and appears to be part of a larger effort to control the flow of humanitarian aid. The new rules are creating a state of limbo for many established INGOs, hindering critical aid delivery.</p>

          <p>Shares of Beyond Meat, the plant-based food company, soared dramatically this week, jumping over 90% on Tuesday alone. The surge followed its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have triggered a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of the company's float had been sold short. This marks a stunning reversal for the former penny stock, which had been underperforming for years. The rally was further fueled by an announcement of expanded distribution with Walmart. The stock's rapid ascent is seen by some as a sign of a frothy market, reminiscent of previous meme stock frenzies. (not investment advice)</p>
