          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that the Washington Commanders NFL team change its name back to the "Washington Redskins," a name dropped in 2020 due to its perception as a slur. He threatened to potentially block a deal for the team to build a new stadium on federal land in Washington, D.C., if the change is not made. Trump also called for the Cleveland Guardians to revert to their "Indians" name, claiming Native American communities support the original names. The Commanders have not commented on the statements.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether all undocumented immigrants in the city should be permitted to stay. When pressed, Bass emphasized the city's economic dependence on immigrant labor and criticized the fear induced by federal immigration raids. While she eventually stated she believes they should stay, she quickly pivoted to calling for comprehensive immigration reform. The exchange highlighted the political complexities of the immigration debate in a major sanctuary city.</p>

          <p>At a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned the audience to be prepared before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where cameras feature crowd members on the big screens. This warning follows a viral incident at a previous show where a tech CEO and his head of HR were captured in an embrace, leading to the CEO's resignation. Martin joked that fans should do their makeup, a lighthearted nod to the controversy that ensued from the previous concert's unplanned broadcast. The original incident has since become a widespread internet meme.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls project his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election took place amid public frustration over rising prices and the threat of US tariffs. A loss of the majority in the upper house, combined with a previous loss in the more powerful lower house, would significantly undermine the coalition's legislative power. The result reflects voter discontent with Ishiba's leadership and could lead to political instability during pivotal trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebellion have signed a peace declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and direct negotiations. The agreement includes a clear timeline, with a comprehensive peace accord intended to be signed within a month. However, experts and analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the immediate emergence of conflicting interpretations regarding rebel withdrawal from occupied zones. The success of the deal will depend on genuine political will and the implementation of effective monitoring mechanisms, which have been lacking in previous agreements.</p>

The women, aged 31, 34, and 42, were arrested on Tuesday, and Police Scotland's counter-terrorism unit is leading the investigation. In a separate but related inquiry, counter-terrorism officers are also investigating pro-Palestinian marchers for allegedly displaying support for Palestine Action, an organization recently banned under anti-terror laws.

This is the first time the government has set a specific target on spill numbers, responding to public fury over the pollution of UK waterways. The pledge comes as data shows serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The government also acknowledged that the sector's regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing," but stopped short of committing to its abolition or the nationalization of water companies.
