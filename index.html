          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 18:25:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, permitting the deportation of migrants with criminal records from a U.S. naval base in Djibouti to third countries like South Sudan. This decision reverses a lower court's injunction that had required the government to first provide fear-of-return interviews before such removals could proceed. The majority opinion stated the lower court could not enforce an order that the high court had already stayed. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the ruling allows the administration to pursue unlawful ends and places the deportees at risk of torture or death, highlighting the contentious nature of the administration's third-country removal policy.</p>

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying one of its largest-ever peacetime security operations for the upcoming Brics summit, involving approximately 20,000 military personnel. The extensive measures are designed to protect leaders and officials from 28 countries and seven international organizations gathering in the city. Security protocols include strict airspace control over the summit venue, with armed fighter jets authorized to intercept and, if necessary, shoot down unauthorized aircraft. Additionally, the city's main domestic airport, Santos Dumont, will be closed to commercial flights, which will be rerouted to the international terminal to ensure the safety of the high-profile event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive spending bill passed by Republicans will introduce significant changes to federal programs, though many effects will be delayed until after the 2026 elections. The legislation imposes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and is projected by the CBO to reduce federal spending on the program by $1 trillion over a decade, potentially leaving millions uninsured. It also tightens work requirements for the SNAP food assistance program and forces states to co-fund benefits starting in 2028. Key tax changes include new deductions for tips and overtime, an increased SALT deduction cap, and the elimination of credits for electric vehicles and green home upgrades.

          <p>A House Rules Committee hearing on a major budget bill became intensely confrontational after Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost made a provocative statement. Frost accused pro-life Republicans of only wanting children to be born so they can "get shot in school," a remark that immediately drew outrage from GOP members. The committee chair, Rep. Virginia Foxx, forcefully reprimanded Frost, stating he had gone "over the cliff" and was impugning the integrity of his colleagues. The incident, which included motions to strike the comments from the record and biblical references from other members, highlighted the deep partisan divisions surrounding gun control and abortion issues in Congress.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has secured a permit to operate natural gas-burning turbines to power its massive supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. The decision by the Shelby County Health Department came despite significant opposition from local residents, who raised concerns about air quality and pollution from emissions like nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde. The permit includes emissions limits and testing requirements, with potential fines for non-compliance. This development occurs as xAI faces a lawsuit from the NAACP over alleged Clean Air Act violations and continues its expansion to compete with other major AI systems, with the turbines being a key part of its power infrastructure.</p>

          <p>According to a Hollywood Reporter article, Pixar's animated film "Elio" underwent significant changes, removing LGBTQ+ representation after negative feedback from test screenings. The original director, Adrian Molina, reportedly left the project after executives decided to alter his vision, which included scenes hinting at the main character's queer identity. Changes allegedly involved removing a picture of a male crush and making the protagonist more "masculine," leading to an exodus of creative talent from the production. The final version of the film, which saw a disappointing box office opening, is described by former staffers as a generic and inferior version of Molina's original, more personal story.</p>

          <p>With the Fourth of July celebrations approaching, dog owners are advised to take precautions to manage their pets' fear and anxiety caused by loud fireworks. Experts from Canine Companions suggest that owners should avoid taking dogs to fireworks shows due to their sensitive hearing. Instead, they recommend exercising dogs earlier in the day to tire them out and providing mental stimulation with activities like hide-and-seek or frozen food-puzzle toys. For dogs known to be sensitive to noise, creating a safe, comfortable space at home, playing calming music, and using anxiety vests can help mitigate their stress during the festivities and prevent them from bolting in fear.</p>

          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has proposed a major fiscal intervention to stabilize China's economy, recommending the issuance of 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds. This move would be used to swap the hidden debts of local governments, which are seen as a significant systemic risk. Researchers from Tsinghua University argue that resolving this deep-rooted debt crisis is crucial for restoring growth momentum and preventing financial instability.

Discovered using a telescope in Chile, the comet is currently 420 million miles from the sun and traveling at 37 miles per second, posing no threat to Earth. Astronomers are actively monitoring the object to determine its size and composition, with preliminary observations suggesting it may be several miles across and larger than the previous two interstellar visitors, Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

The legislation makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, increases spending on border security and the military, and introduces new tax exemptions for tips and overtime.

Employers could then contribute a portion of this cost, significantly lowering the out-of-pocket expense for employees to a level comparable to prices in other countries. This simplified, transparent pricing model could improve public health by increasing access to these transformative but currently expensive medications. (not investment advice)</p>

Furthermore, the declaration's famous assertion that all men are created equal is not a universally self-evident truth, but rather a concept derived directly from the West's biblical inheritance, specifically the idea that humanity is created in God's image. Thus, political and religious heritage were more foundational than pure liberal rationalism.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Northern California has left seven people unaccounted for, according to officials. The incident, which occurred in Yolo County, prompted mandatory evacuations and sparked multiple grass fires covering approximately 80 acres. Two individuals were confirmed to be injured, while families of missing workers gathered nearby, awaiting news. The company, which has an active fireworks license, released a statement expressing sorrow for those lost and pledging cooperation with the investigation. The blast was felt by residents miles away, who described their houses shaking as if from an earthquake.</p>

According to the filing, McGraw has been personally funding the struggling venture, which has already resulted in layoffs and the termination of a TV deal. The suit describes the technical services provided by TBN as "comically dysfunctional," hindering the network's operations from the start.</p>

          <p>The sweeping domestic policy bill passed by Congress includes a new, temporary tax break specifically for senior citizens. For the tax years 2025 through 2028, individuals aged 65 and older will be able to claim an additional standard deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 for couples, on their federal income taxes. This benefit is designed to help middle-income seniors, as it begins to phase out for individuals earning over $75,000. While a significant boost for eligible taxpayers, fiscal responsibility advocates note that it primarily benefits upper-middle-class seniors and could potentially accelerate the insolvency of Social Security and Medicare.

          <p>A London High Court ruling has sharply criticized Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, for repeatedly misleading courts about an informant who was accused of serious domestic abuse. The case involves a woman who alleged her former partner, an MI5 informant, boasted of immunity from prosecution, which empowered his abusive behavior. For years, MI5 denied the man's role, citing its "Neither Confirm Nor Deny" policy, even after its director apologized for providing false evidence. The court slammed the agency's internal handling of the matter and recommended a robust, independent inquiry, raising serious questions about MI5's accountability and its long-held tradition of secrecy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience in June, with employers adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' forecasts. According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was strongest in the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the healthcare industry also saw significant gains. This robust employment data suggests the job market remains on solid ground despite broader economic uncertainties related to trade and fiscal policy. The strong report may influence the Federal Reserve to hold off on interest rate cuts in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While a new Republican spending bill makes many 2017 tax cuts permanent, several of its most promoted new tax breaks are set to expire in 2028. These temporary provisions include an above-the-line deduction for tips and another for overtime pay, both of which were key campaign promises. The bill also introduces a temporary deduction for interest paid on new auto loans and creates "Trump accounts," a new type of government-seeded savings vehicle for children born between 2025 and 2028. The temporary nature of these popular breaks sets up a future fiscal cliff, similar to the one that prompted the current legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

Imagining the Founding Fathers' reaction, the piece humorously highlights the ugly political maneuvering required to get the legislation to the president's desk. It mocks the last-minute deals, like a provision for Alaskan whalers to secure a key vote, the record-long voting times, and the immense pressure exerted by the president. The author uses this satirical frame to critique the modern legislative process, suggesting it has strayed far from the deliberative system the founders envisioned, becoming a spectacle of partisan power plays.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals disturbing new details in the murder of his wife, Suzanne. The indictment alleges that Suzanne's remains, found in a shallow grave, were moved there after her body had already decomposed elsewhere, suggesting her body was moved at least twice. Furthermore, toxicologists found a chemical compound used for tranquilizing wildlife in her bone marrow, a substance Barry Morphew had access to and admitted using on deer. This evidence supports the prosecution's theory that he sedated his wife before her death, adding a grim new layer to the high-profile case as he faces a first-degree murder charge.</p>
