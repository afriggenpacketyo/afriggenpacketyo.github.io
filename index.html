          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured victory in the federal election, a surprising turn of events influenced by U.S. President Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose sweeping tariffs. The Liberal Party's popularity had been declining, leading to Justin Trudeau's resignation, but Trump's intervention shifted voter priorities toward safeguarding Canadian sovereignty. Voters expressed concerns about tariffs and affordability, emphasizing the need for Canada to diversify its global partnerships. Despite Trump's continued rhetoric, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre asserted Canada's independence, while Liberal leader Mark Carney pledged to confront Trump's annexation threats.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has responded to anonymous criticism of her leadership, labeling the critics as "cowards" amidst growing concerns about potential losses in upcoming local elections.

This comes amidst reported tensions between Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, who she defeated in last year's leadership contest, regarding a potential electoral pact with Reform UK.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following reports that the legal journal was selecting articles based on authors' race rather than merit. These investigations, conducted by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services, are in response to allegations of discriminatory practices that may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This action follows earlier disputes between the Trump administration and Harvard over diversity programs and concerns about antisemitism on campus.</p>
