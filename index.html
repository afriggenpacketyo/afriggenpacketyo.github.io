          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood restaurant famous for its classic Italian-American cuisine and celebrity clientele, has passed away at the age of 90. Originally a professional soccer player from Serbia, Tana opened his eatery in 1964, creating a late-night haven for Hollywood stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. The restaurant became an L.A. institution, known for its discreet service, checkered tablecloths, and enduring old-world charm. Though Tana sold the establishment in 2009, his legacy continues through the restaurant's unchanged character and menu.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off, signaling escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The postponement comes as President Trump has imposed a cumulative 50% tariff rate on Indian exports, one of the highest for any U.S. trading partner. A significant portion of these duties are a stated penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the measures as unfair, highlighting that both the U.S. and E.U. continue their own trade with Russia, creating a complex backdrop for future negotiations.

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening to a Category 4 storm. While lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and wind, the hurricane is forecast to remain a major storm for several days. Current meteorological models predict Erin will stay well off the U.S. East Coast, tracking between Bermuda and the mainland. However, it is still expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from South Carolina to Virginia between August 20 and 27.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing "85th percentile rule," which bases speed limits on the speed of the 15th-fastest car out of 100, is facing reconsideration across the United States. This decades-old concept, originating from studies of rural roads, often leads to speed limits being raised even in urban areas, creating a feedback loop where faster driving justifies higher limits. Amid rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that this is a guideline, not a rigid rule, urging communities to also consider pedestrian safety and crash frequency. Some cities are now adopting new models that prioritize safety over vehicle speed.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have developed a new method that makes biological tissues, including the brain, transparent, allowing for unprecedentedly clear 3D imaging of their internal structures. The technique creates what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the original morphology of organs while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. This innovation produces vivid and highly accurate three-dimensional views of the tissue's inner workings. The process also allows for the long-term storage of these transparent tissues at low temperatures without degradation, maintaining their structural integrity for future study.</p>

In exchange, Russia would agree to freeze the front lines in other occupied areas like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This development marks a significant shift, as Trump now appears to favor a direct peace agreement over a temporary ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected surrendering territory and is scheduled to meet Trump at the White House, faces increased pressure to negotiate under these terms.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The win was significantly aided by a series of sloppy plays from the Padres, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that allowed two runs to score. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's mistakes. The victory not only extended the Dodgers' division lead but also clinched the head-to-head season series against their rivals.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing for a high-stakes meeting in Washington D.C., where he faces pressure to engage in peace talks under terms influenced by the recent Trump-Putin summit. Analysts suggest Zelenskyy feels compelled to participate to avoid being portrayed as an obstacle to peace, despite risks of an unfavorable deal. Optimism in Kyiv faded after President Trump abandoned the call for a ceasefire, instead proposing a direct peace agreement that could involve Ukraine ceding more territory.

          <p>Chinese researchers are exploring a novel aircraft design for a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a single, rotating "scissor wing." This concept, once a dream of NASA, aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of flying at both low and high speeds. At takeoff, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as the aircraft approaches Mach 5, it pivots 90 degrees to align with the fuselage. In this configuration, the entire vehicle functions as a "waverider," optimizing performance in the hypersonic regime by managing shock waves and maintaining lift efficiently.</p>

Other triggers are the burdens of perfectionism, having poor emotional boundaries from a young age, being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage, and experiencing a recent significant loss. The article suggests that understanding these underlying issues is crucial before passing moral judgment, as they often stem from deep-seated emotional patterns.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents across the U.K. are sharing creative strategies to manage the extra cost of feeding children during the six-week summer holidays. Tactics include meticulous planning, buying reduced "yellow sticker" items to freeze for later, and batch cooking meals to save time and money. Some parents use systems like organizing food into daily bags or arranging their fridge by use-by dates to minimize waste. Charities report a significant increase in demand for meal ingredients this summer, highlighting the financial pressure many families face when subsidized school dinners are unavailable.</p>

          <h2>US State Department Halts Medical Visas for Gazan Children Following Online Campaign</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has abruptly stopped issuing visitor visas for individuals from Gaza, a policy that had allowed critically ill children to receive medical care in the United States. The decision came after a far-right influencer, Laura Loomer, launched an online pressure campaign falsely characterizing videos of injured Palestinian children as security threats. Aid organizations like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund have condemned the move as inhumane and dangerous, stating it cuts off a lifeline for children in a territory with collapsed medical infrastructure. The halt is officially pending a review of the visa issuance procedures.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the accessories chain long popular with tweens and teenagers, has appointed administrators for its operations in the U.K. and Ireland amid falling sales and intense competition. The company's 306 stores in the region will continue to trade for now as it explores future options, though online sales have been halted. For decades, Claire's was a rite of passage for young shoppers seeking affordable jewelry, hair accessories, and ear piercings. However, the brand has struggled to compete with the rise of fast-fashion giants like Shein and a shift in youth culture toward social media trends and more premium brands.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field after sustaining a concussion during a preseason game against the Rams. The injury occurred on the third play from scrimmage when Johnston took a helmet-to-chin hit from a Rams safety after an incomplete pass. He was evaluated at a local hospital as a precaution but was reportedly conscious and remembered the play. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks of playing starters in preseason games, especially for a key player like Johnston, who led the team in touchdown catches last season.</p>

          <h2>UK Experiences Signs of an Early Autumn Amid Summer Heatwave</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 19:12:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing summer heat, parts of the United Kingdom are showing signs typically associated with autumn, such as leaves changing color and blackberries ripening prematurely. Experts attribute this phenomenon to a "false autumn," where trees and plants are stressed by prolonged heat and drought, causing them to shut down early to conserve resources. This summer is on track to be one of the warmest on record, leading to early harvests and concerns for wildlife. Conservationists warn that the chaotic seasonal shift could disrupt food sources for animals like birds and badgers later in the year.</p>

          <p>This article tells the personal story of Bill Theodie, a homeless man in Washington D.C. whose photo was posted by President Trump to justify a crackdown on encampments. It details how, days after the post, his encampment was cleared by bulldozers, forcing him and other residents to move immediately. The article provides a human perspective on the administration's new policy, which fast-tracked the removal process and offers shelter placement under threat of fines or jail. Mr. Theodie's experience highlights the direct impact of the federal intervention on the city's unhoused population.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has remained in a Kenyan mortuary for over 11 years due to a bitter family feud following his death in 2013. An inquest concluded this week but could not determine a cause of death because of the body's decomposition after being exhumed. Veevers' sons from his first marriage alleged he was poisoned by his second wife and their daughters to inherit his estate, a claim they denied. The case is complicated by disputes over his religion, burial location, and the lack of a will, leaving his final resting place still unresolved.</p>

          <p>A group of students about to receive their GCSE results have opened time capsule letters they wrote to themselves as 11-year-olds in 2021, during a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their younger selves' hopes, fears, and questions about the future, from anxieties about the pandemic to queries about having a girlfriend. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a disruptive period, provided a moment of reflection for a cohort whose entire secondary education was shaped by the pandemic. Four years later, the students revisited their ambitions and reflected on their personal growth.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addresses the plight of children affected by the war, though its text is opaque and does not explicitly mention the abduction of Ukrainian children, a war crime for which Putin has been indicted. The letter vaguely implores Putin to "restore their melodic laughter" and states he is fit to implement this vision. The Ukrainian government expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the issue of forcibly deported children.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a Chilean town once known as Colonia Dignidad, faces a contentious future as the government plans to expropriate land to create a memorial for victims of the Pinochet dictatorship. The secretive German sect, led by Paul Schäfer, subjected residents to forced labor and sexual assault, and collaborated with the regime to torture and kill political prisoners. While victims' families support the memorial, some current residents, who also identify as victims of Schäfer's regime, oppose the plan because it includes their homes and businesses. The debate highlights the complex and dark legacy of the former colony.</p>
