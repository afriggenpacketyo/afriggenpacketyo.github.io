          <p>The inauguration of Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has ignited a tense diplomatic dispute with Egypt, which denounces the project as an "unlawful unilateral act" threatening its water supply. Ethiopia hails the US$5 billion dam as a symbol of national achievement, while Egypt warns of international legal action and Sudan also expresses concerns. Observers suggest China, with its strong ties to all three nations, is uniquely positioned to mediate the escalating row, though Beijing has largely remained neutral. This article highlights the geopolitical implications of the controversial mega-dam and the potential for a major power to intervene in the regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Australia is investing an initial AU$12 billion ($8 billion) to upgrade its Henderson shipyard, transforming it into a maintenance hub for a future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. This 20-year plan is part of the 2021 AUKUS agreement with the UK and US, aimed at countering China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. The significant investment will create high-security dry docks and facilities for other naval vessels, supporting around 10,000 local jobs. This article details Australia's strategic defense spending, its commitment to the AUKUS pact, and the potential for the United States to utilize these new facilities, despite an ongoing review of the agreement by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The 2005 disappearance of George Smith from his honeymoon cruise remains a cold case, despite a decade-long FBI investigation, leaving his family tormented and seeking justice. Suspicion initially fell on his widow, then shifted to a group of young men last seen with Smith, whose polygraphs failed and alibis were questioned. Evidence includes a bloodstain, sounds of a struggle, and a "provocative" videotape made by some men after Smith's disappearance, with one allegedly bragging about being "gangsta." This article delves into the complex investigation, conflicting accounts, and theories ranging from an alcohol-fueled accident to a robbery-turned-murder, highlighting the family's persistent quest for truth after the FBI officially closed the case.</p>

          <p>Academics warn that increasing or removing limits on contactless card payments could lead to a rise in spontaneous spending and debt, as the current £100 PIN threshold serves as a crucial "friction point." The UK's financial regulator proposed allowing banks to set their own limits or remove them entirely, prompting concerns that consumers might spend more frequently and larger amounts without conscious thought. While digital wallets already offer unlimited payments with biometric security, charities highlight the risk of "limitless economic abuse" for vulnerable individuals. This article explores the debate over convenience versus financial prudence, and the potential societal impacts of unchecked contactless spending. (not investment advice)</p>
