            <p>Delta Air Lines has revised its financial outlook, citing weaker-than-expected bookings and broader economic uncertainty linked to President Trump's trade policies. CEO Ed Bastian attributed the slowdown to a decline in consumer and corporate confidence, particularly impacting main cabin bookings, though international and premium travel remain resilient. Delta has subsequently flattened its planned capacity expansion for the second half of 2025 and is prioritizing margin protection amidst global trade concerns. Despite the revised forecast, Delta reported first-quarter earnings above expectations, with net income rising to $240 million.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's persistent focus on bilateral trade deficits as a sign of economic loss is driving his administration's trade policy, despite widespread criticism from economists. Trump believes that a trade deficit with any country means the US is losing and aims to achieve surpluses or at least break even. This approach has led to high tariffs on countries like Vietnam and strained relationships with allies like Canada, hindering efforts to build a united front against China. Economists argue that Trump's fixation ignores the benefits of international trade and specialization, potentially harming the US economy through increased costs and supply chain disruptions.</p>

Trump asserts these tariffs will stimulate US manufacturing and job growth, aiming to reduce the trade deficit. However, economists warn of potential harm to the global economy and increased prices for consumers. The tariffs are calculated to eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country, although some countries face tariffs despite buying more from the US than they sell.</p>

The changes, including job cuts and office consolidations, have led to crashed webpages, jammed phone lines, and walk-ins being turned away. Advocacy groups have filed a lawsuit alleging that the overhaul has severely undermined services and caused irreparable harm to beneficiaries. The SSA acknowledges telephone wait times are too long and its website has faced challenges, but claims the issues predate the current Administration.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman's decision to reinstate the death penalty in certain murder cases is drawing criticism, with opponents arguing it is a step backward in the pursuit of justice. Concerns about racial bias and the potential for executing innocent individuals are central to the debate. The move reverses a policy of Hochman's predecessor, George Gascón, and aligns with Hochman's tough-on-crime platform. Critics contend that the death penalty is inherently flawed and disproportionately affects people of color, undermining efforts to ensure fairness in the criminal justice system.</p>

            <p>President Trump's immigration policies are raising concerns about a potential worsening of the healthcare worker shortage in the U.S. A recent analysis shows that over 1 million noncitizen immigrants, including a significant number without legal status, are employed in essential healthcare roles. Mass deportations and stricter immigration enforcement could lead to bottlenecks in the healthcare system, compromising care quality. Experts also fear that anti-immigration policies may prompt foreign-born physicians and nurses to seek employment in more welcoming countries, further exacerbating existing shortages, especially in home health and nursing homes.</p>
