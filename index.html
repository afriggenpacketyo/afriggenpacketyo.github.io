          <p>A substantial $130 million donation, announced by Donald Trump to cover military salaries during the government shutdown, has been attributed to Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking family. This contribution, however, amounts to only about $100 per service member, raising questions about its actual impact. Furthermore, legal experts cited by The New York Times suggest the donation could potentially violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from using funds not appropriated by Congress. Mellon is a prominent long-term donor to Trump-aligned political action committees, having previously contributed tens of millions.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the European Union is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing high-tech products like smartphones and electric vehicles. The move is a response to recent export license requirements and curbs imposed by Beijing, which the EU claims have damaged European industries. Von der Leyen emphasized that while short-term solutions with China are being explored, the EU is prepared to use all available tools to respond. The long-term strategy involves boosting recycling, forming partnerships with other producer nations, and achieving greater material independence.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a participant in the January 6 Capitol riot who was later pardoned by President Trump, has been arrested and charged with making a terroristic threat. Court documents reveal Moynihan allegedly sent text messages stating his intent to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City, writing that the lawmaker "must be eliminated." This incident highlights growing concerns about recidivism among pardoned rioters and contributes to a significant increase in threats against members of Congress. Jeffries responded by stating that such threats would not deter him from serving the American people.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological healing, inspiring global conservation efforts. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water temperatures have stabilized, and native wildlife is returning to the restored riverbanks. The restoration was marked by a historic 310-mile kayak journey by Indigenous youth, who were the first to navigate the full length of the free-flowing river in more than 100 years. This successful project now serves as a powerful model for Indigenous-led environmental movements worldwide, demonstrating that large-scale river restoration is achievable.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, a measure to redraw congressional districts in favor of Democrats, is being marketed to voters as a way to counteract Republican gerrymandering in other states and as a direct challenge to Donald Trump. Proponents, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are framing the initiative as a necessary "fight fire with fire" strategy to reclaim seats they argue were unfairly engineered by Republicans in states like Texas. Polling suggests this anti-Trump messaging is highly effective in California, where the former president has low approval ratings. Despite concerns about abandoning the state's independent redistricting commission, the visceral appeal of opposing Trump appears to be driving strong support for the measure.</p>

          <p>A commentary in a key Chinese Communist Party publication suggests that digital currencies are becoming a powerful tool in geopolitics, with the potential to be 'militarized' to create a sanction-proof economy. The article highlights how cryptocurrencies offer fast, secure, and anonymous transactions that could be leveraged during military or geopolitical conflicts. The author points to a Pentagon blockchain initiative as evidence that the U.S. also views digital assets as a strategic tool for financial defense. This perspective indicates that China may be considering digital currencies as a way to insulate itself from economic pressure and maintain financial autonomy on the global stage.

Over its 200-year history, the house has also gained a reputation for being haunted, with numerous reports of unexplained phenomena like flickering lights and the scent of lilacs, Dolley Madison's favorite flower.

          <p>A new study suggests a significant link between contaminated meat and urinary tract infections (UTIs), finding that nearly 18% of cases in a Southern California group were caused by E. coli strains also found in local grocery store meat. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the bacteria's DNA from patients back to animal sources, with turkey and chicken being the most common carriers. The findings reframe foodborne E. coli as not just a cause of gastrointestinal illness but also a major contributor to UTIs, which can become life-threatening if they spread. The study also noted a higher risk in lower-income areas, pointing to systemic issues in food safety and distribution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a decision that trade experts warn could lead to higher prices for consumers on goods like automobiles and home appliances. The move was reportedly a reaction to a Canadian television ad that featured former President Ronald Reagan cautioning against trade wars. This halt could keep steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum—key components in cars and appliances—in place for an extended period. With Canada being the top exporter of these metals to the U.S., prolonged tariffs are likely to increase manufacturing costs, which would then be passed on to American consumers.

This stagnation contrasts sharply with soaring home prices in much of the rest of the country.

          <p>In a new interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris has strongly indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028, stating that her career in public service is "not done." While not officially confirming a decision, she dismissed current polls that show her with low support, noting that she has defied polling expectations throughout her political career. In the interview, Harris also sharply criticized Donald Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" with "thin skin" who has weaponized the justice system and pressured business leaders to capitulate to his demands. She asserted that her previous warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of 'sleepmaxxing,' or optimizing rest with technology, was highlighted when a recent Amazon Web Services outage caused high-tech Eight Sleep mattresses to malfunction. Users reported their beds being stuck at freezing or sweltering temperatures, or in upright positions, as the cloud-dependent features failed. This incident sheds light on the booming sleep-tech industry, now valued at over $29 billion, which offers everything from smart eye masks to neurotech headbands. While some technologies can help those with medical conditions like PTSD, the increasing reliance on complex gadgets for a basic biological function introduces new points of failure into the quest for a good night's sleep.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Seattle-area mansion for $63 million, two years after relocating to Miami with his wife, Lauren Sánchez. Bezos originally purchased the Hunts Point property for $37.5 million in 2019, realizing a profit of over $25 million from the sale. This major real estate transaction comes as Bezos continues to divest his holdings in Amazon, with his ownership stake in the company now falling below 10%. The sale also occurs amidst an ongoing legal battle where Bezos is seeking to have his wife's estranged brother, Michael Sánchez, cover over $190,000 in legal fees stemming from a defamation lawsuit.</p>

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused the U.S. of stoking a new conflict, while President Trump has suggested that strikes on land targets could be imminent.

While her victory over the Starmer-aligned candidate Bridget Phillipson was clear, it was not a landslide, suggesting a divided sentiment within the party. Powell's election is seen by political analysts as an expression of the party's anxiety over its current standing and a series of recent political missteps. Following the result, Powell and Starmer held a private meeting, with observers noting the potentially awkward dynamic between the prime minister and his newly elected, and recently dismissed, deputy.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently lagging the S&P 500 index by its largest margin this year, with its Class B shares up 8.6% year-to-date compared to the index's 15.5% gain. A significant factor in this underperformance is Berkshire's decision to sell a large portion of its stake in Apple. Since Berkshire began reducing its holdings in late 2023, Apple's stock has risen over 50%, meaning the firm has left an estimated $50 billion in potential profits unrealized. Buffett has explained the sale by citing the likelihood of future capital gains tax increases, suggesting it was prudent to realize some gains at the current lower rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist advises that setting boundaries for children should involve more than just the word "no." To foster connection rather than conflict, parents should turn "no" into a teachable moment by explaining the reasoning behind the limit, especially concerning safety and kindness. Offering children choices within established boundaries helps them feel a sense of autonomy and control, making them more likely to cooperate. The expert also stresses the importance of consistency in enforcing rules and repairing the relationship with an explanation or apology after an instinctive, emotional reaction, which teaches accountability and empathy.</p>

This fosters resilience and self-starting traits that are valuable in adulthood.
