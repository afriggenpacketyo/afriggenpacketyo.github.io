          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers visited Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two students detained by ICE in Louisiana for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, and Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student, were arrested separately in March. Lawmakers like Reps. Cleo Fields, Troy Carter, Bennie Thompson, Ayana Pressley, and Sen. Edward J. Markey met with them, criticizing the administration's crackdown on alleged antisemitism on college campuses and accusing them of intentionally instilling fear. Khalil's lawyers are seeking bail and an injunction, while Öztürk's case is being challenged in Vermont. </p>

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump can learn from Xi Jinping's approach to restoring harmony in Chinese society after decades of uneven economic growth. The author argues that American society is plagued by imbalances and that Trump's immediate priority should be to stabilize the country. The piece posits that Trump's 'Make America Great Again' vision resonated with working-class voters disillusioned by income inequality but alienated university-educated voters who felt it undermined rights and freedoms. The author contrasts Trump's polarizing demeanor with the balanced approach of Chinese leaders, who blend philosophy, power, and pragmatism.</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter results revealed sales and profit declines, leading investors to question Elon Musk's focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Investors are concerned that Musk's involvement in government and politics is negatively impacting Tesla's performance and alienating consumers. Analysts suggest Musk's personal brand has been tarnished by his political activities, leading to a potential decrease in demand for Tesla vehicles. The company's earnings report cited 'trade policy' and 'changing political sentiment' as factors impacting demand. </p>

Measures include halting humanitarian aid shipments allegedly seized by Hamas for funds and targeting key financial officials.

Hamas is reportedly relying on dwindling reserves and struggling to attract new recruits, while facing protests in Gaza calling for a ceasefire. There is hope for a new ceasefire deal mediated by Qatar and Egypt.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax. Economists, however, are skeptical of this proposal, citing it as unrealistic. Trump's statement comes amid ongoing tariff negotiations and a 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs enacted earlier in April. The current tariff rate on goods imported into the United States is 10%, with tariffs on imports from China reaching as high as 145%.</p>
