          <h2>Delta and United Airlines Emerge as Market Leaders Amid Industry Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:25:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts observe that Delta and United Airlines are increasingly dominating the U.S. airline industry, capturing over 86% of major carrier profits last year. Their strategic focus on premium seating, international routes, and robust loyalty programs allows them to better withstand economic pressures like falling domestic airfares. While competitors struggle and overall capacity is being scaled back post-summer, these two carriers are solidifying their market leadership. This trend highlights a growing divide between the top-tier airlines and the rest of the pack.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence (GRU) units and 18 officers for conducting a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activities. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the GRU's actions, which included targeting UK media, infrastructure, and political institutions, are aimed at destabilizing Europe amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. These sanctions coincide with new EU measures against Russia, including a ban on transactions related to the Nord Stream pipeline, to increase pressure on the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Joseph Lawson, one of three men convicted in the 2015 murder of Kentucky mother Crystal Rogers, is requesting a new trial. His attorneys argue that being tried alongside Rogers' boyfriend, Brooks Houck, unfairly prejudiced the jury against him due to evidence presented that was specific to Houck. Lawson was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and evidence tampering, with the jury recommending a 25-year sentence. A final sentencing hearing for both Lawson and Houck is scheduled for August.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's July consumer survey indicates a significant drop in inflation expectations, with the one-year outlook falling to 4.4% from 5% in June. This marks the lowest level since before President Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting consumers believe the price hikes will be temporary. Despite this improved outlook, overall sentiment remains below long-term averages, and consumers still perceive future inflation risks. The data provides an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve's efforts to manage economic perceptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, and the network will retire "The Late Show" franchise entirely. The network described the move as a "purely a financial decision" in a challenging late-night television landscape and emphasized it was not related to the show's content or performance. Colbert, who has hosted since 2015 and has been the top-rated late-night host for nine seasons, informed his audience of the decision during a taping. The network praised his contribution to late-night television.</p>

          <p>Meta has declined to sign the European Union's new voluntary code of practice for artificial intelligence, arguing that its provisions are an overreach that will stifle innovation. Joel Kaplan, Meta's global affairs chief, stated the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the EU's already-passed AI Act. This positions Meta against other major tech players like OpenAI, which has committed to signing the agreement. The move highlights the growing tension between tech giants and regulators over how to govern the rapidly advancing field of AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can be a tool to supplement Social Security income and improve monthly cash flow. This financial product allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into a lump sum, a line of credit, or regular monthly payments. This can help cover daily expenses, handle unexpected healthcare costs, or even allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security to receive a larger future benefit. Repayment is typically deferred until the homeowner moves, sells the property, or passes away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German farmers harvested the lowest amount of strawberries and asparagus in decades in 2025, according to the country's Federal Statistical Office. The decline is attributed to farmers planting less of these crops, as rising costs, particularly for labor, make them increasingly unprofitable to grow. This trend is turning these seasonal favorites into luxury items for consumers, with prices for both having risen significantly over the past decade. The nation's self-sufficiency in strawberries has consequently dropped from 68% in 2015 to just 50% today.</p>
