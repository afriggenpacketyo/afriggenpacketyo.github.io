        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany has seen a significant increase in Turkish citizens seeking German citizenship, with the number more than doubling in 2024. This surge is attributed to several factors, including Germany's recent citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship and the deteriorating political and economic situation in Turkey. Many Turkish immigrants are drawn to Germany for career opportunities and the benefits of a German passport, which offers visa-free travel to numerous countries. Despite integrating into German society, some Turkish citizens still feel a strong connection to their homeland and experience instances of discrimination in Germany.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The strikes involved B-2 bombers using "bunker-buster" bombs and Tomahawk missiles launched from submarines, and the U.S. claims the facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated." Trump warned Iran against retaliation, stating that any such action would be met with overwhelming force, while also urging Iran to seek a peace deal with Israel. The strikes have drawn mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers, with Republicans largely supporting the action and Democrats criticizing the lack of congressional authorization.</p>

          <p>A boat capsized on Lake Tahoe, resulting in the deaths of six people and leaving two others missing. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that the 27-foot boat capsized due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park. Search operations are underway, involving multiple agencies including the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office and California State Parks. Weather conditions shifted rapidly, with blue skies giving way to a storm system that brought high winds and snow to the area.</p>

Some lawmakers, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, opposed the U.S. action altogether, arguing it is "not our fight."

          <p>President Trump's suggestion of a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran was reportedly a feint to keep Iran off guard before the U.S. launched airstrikes on its nuclear facilities. The decision to strike was made privately after a meeting with national security advisors, despite Trump's public statements suggesting a chance for negotiation. The administration is bracing for potential Iranian retaliation, which could target U.S. bases, personnel, or facilities in the region. The operation was closely coordinated with Israel, and Trump believed a "little push from us would make it incredibly successful."</p>

          <p>Sunday's newspaper front pages, printed before the U.S. strikes on Iran, covered various stories including the conflict in Iran, a spy plot arrest in Cyprus, and domestic UK issues. The Sunday Telegraph led with the arrest of a British man suspected of spying for Iran, while The Observer focused on the escalating conflict in Iran. UK-based stories included asylum hotels, NHS treatment abroad, and Prince William's birthday. The newspapers went to print before President Trump confirmed the US had struck nuclear sites in Iran.</p>
