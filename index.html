          <h2>Trump Doubles Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum Imports, Excluding the UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 01:06:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, aiming to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue the move could harm steel producers outside the US, provoke retaliation, and increase costs for American users of the metals. The UK has been granted an exemption from the increased duties due to ongoing trade discussions with the US, maintaining its rate at 25%. Economists predict the tariffs will raise prices and could lead to job losses in sectors reliant on these metals, despite potentially creating jobs in the steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Musk expressed concern that the bill would significantly increase the national debt and burden American citizens. Surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders echoed Musk's sentiments, calling the bill an "abomination" due to its tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to food aid for the impoverished. The White House defended the bill as "one big, beautiful bill," despite the criticism from prominent figures across the political spectrum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's drone attack on Russian military airfields and critical assets has highlighted the vulnerability of even advanced militaries to inexpensive drone technology. The mission, dubbed Operation Spider's Web, destroyed strategic bombers and demonstrated a significant shift in modern warfare. The success of the operation, planned by Ukraine's Security Service, involved smuggling explosive-laden drones across the border and evading air defenses. This innovative use of technology is likely to inspire similar asymmetric attacks in the future, posing a challenge to military bases and command headquarters worldwide.</p>

The university commissioned an investigation that found the exams were clinically appropriate, but some players contradict this finding, with one alleging Bomba fondled his genitalia.

The move comes amid increasing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind cross-shareholding ties, with the Financial Services Agency advocating for a reduction in such arrangements.

          <p>In Denmark, a debate has erupted over the decision to ban the question of Palestine from the list of issues for national school elections. The speakers of parliament justified the ban by arguing that the issue was too explosive for classroom deliberations and risked placing minority students in uncomfortable situations. Critics argue that this decision contradicts Denmark's tradition of prioritizing freedom of expression and controversial deliberation. The real reason for the ban, the article suggests, is that the governing parties are projecting their own failures onto Danish pupils and want to avoid questions about the war in Gaza, Danish arms exports, and the human rights of Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team's choice to not have her testify in her murder trial is a gamble that could impact the outcome. The prosecution played damaging interview clips of Read, allowing the jury to hear her version of events, but the defense fears cross-examination. Legal experts suggest that while Read could put on a strong performance, her statements in the interviews could be misconstrued. The defense hopes the jury will not hold her silence against her, as she has a right not to testify.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pushing to revive American factories by using tariffs as a key tool. Companies considering re-shoring manufacturing are facing challenges in how to effectively implement this strategy. The success of this initiative will depend on overcoming these obstacles and creating a favorable environment for domestic production.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has achieved a fuel-efficient orbit synchronized with the Earth and moon's motion, but claims of it being the first to do so are disputed. The 3:1 resonant orbit is seen as a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, including navigation systems for interplanetary exploration. Experts from the US and Canada argue that NASA's IBEX probe achieved a similar orbit in 2011. The debate centers on whether Tiandu-1 can definitively claim the title of the first spacecraft to achieve this feat.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of the year, expanding by 1.3% year-on-year, which is below the estimated 1.5%.

Extreme weather events also negatively impacted mining, tourism, and shipping activities.
