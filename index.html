            <h2>Trump Reiterates Call for Fed Rate Cuts, Hints at Powell's Potential Removal</h2>

            <p>President Trump has once again publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even suggesting the potential "termination" of Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump expressed his frustration with Powell's policies, contrasting them with the European Central Bank's rate cuts. A White House official downplayed the comments as a reflection of Trump's ongoing dissatisfaction with the Fed chief, but Trump later doubled down on his criticism, stating he was unhappy with Powell's performance and would remove him if he desired. The independence of the Federal Reserve is a crucial aspect of the American economy.</p>

            <p>Small business owners are expressing concerns that economic uncertainty, largely driven by President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies, could lead to business closures. The lack of clarity on U.S. tariffs makes planning difficult for businesses reliant on imported goods and packaging, especially from China. Economists warn that this uncertainty can dampen consumer spending and hinder strategic decision-making for small businesses. While the Trump administration defends its economic policies, recent economic tremors have eroded the optimism of small business owners.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is threatening to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing concerns about campus antisemitism and discrimination. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warned that Harvard's certification to accept foreign students is contingent on compliance with federal immigration rules. The administration also canceled two grants to Harvard, totaling $2.7 million, deeming the school "unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars." This action is part of a broader clash between the Trump administration and top educational institutions over issues of antisemitism and DEI policies.</p>

            <p>A large-scale blind taste test conducted by NECTAR revealed that while animal meats generally received higher scores, some plant-based meat products were rated equal to or better than their animal counterparts. Impossible Foods' unbreaded chicken fillet performed exceptionally well, with a significant percentage of participants rating it higher than or equal to real chicken. The study suggests that consumer perceptions and social norms may play a significant role in the adoption of plant-based meats, even when taste is comparable. The findings highlight the need for the industry to address both taste and psychological factors to increase consumer acceptance.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to visit his constituent, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported. The El Salvadorian government declined his requests to see Abrego Garcia, who is being held in a notorious mega-prison. The White House has doubled down on its case against Abrego Garcia, stating that he would be deported again if he returned to the U.S. Other lawmakers are considering visiting El Salvador, with Republicans supporting Trump's deportation agenda and Democrats advocating for Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions initiated by President Trump, some investors are considering shifting from U.S. stocks to international equities. Experts suggest that global diversification may be a prudent strategy, but caution against making sudden moves. Some argue that the U.S. market still presents a valuable opportunity, while others point to the potential for international stocks to outperform in the coming years. Financial advisors recommend rebalancing portfolios to ensure proper allocation and mitigate the impact of market volatility (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>President Trump has sharply criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging the central bank to lower interest rates and stating that Powell's "termination cannot come soon enough." The comments follow Powell's concerns about Trump's tariff policy potentially causing inflation and slowing economic growth. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell despite the norm of political independence at the central bank. The Fed is an independent government agency, and legal experts note that removing a Fed chair requires "cause," which a policy dispute is unlikely to meet.</p>

            <p>American Express reports that its affluent cardholders are showing little sign of reducing their spending despite concerns about President Trump's tariff policies. Growth in transaction volumes was driven by younger customers, with millennial and Gen Z members spending significantly more. While some small businesses may be building inventory due to tariff concerns, American Express's wealthier customer base appears to be insulated from economic jitters. These trends helped AmEx exceed expectations for first-quarter profit.</p>

He also emphasized that the letter did not represent the position of the Board of Deputies as an organization or the UK Jewish community as a whole.

            <p>Tax attorneys report that the IRS has become a "zombie" due to staff cuts and a halt to audits of wealthy taxpayers. The IRS is expected to lose a significant portion of its staff, leading to fewer audits and reviews, especially for high-income earners. The cuts have resulted in some audits being dropped and concerns about the agency's ability to enforce tax laws effectively. Attorneys anticipate that taxpayers may become more aggressive with tax planning techniques due to the reduced oversight.</p>
