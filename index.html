          <p>A school district in DeKalb County, Georgia, is observing significant positive outcomes from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers and administrators at Lakeside High School report that since implementing the policy, student engagement has increased while disciplinary issues have decreased substantially. This local initiative is stricter than a forthcoming statewide ban and reflects a growing national trend, with over half of U.S. states now regulating phone use in schools to improve the learning environment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, alleging that the city's sanctuary policies violate federal law by obstructing immigration enforcement. The Trump administration's lawsuit specifically targets the Boston Trust Act, which limits municipal cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Mayor Wu has defended the city's stance, calling the lawsuit an "unconstitutional attack" and reaffirming that Boston will not alter its policies, which she argues align with Massachusetts state law.</p>

The plan involves deploying an international "reassurance force" on land, sea, and air to deter any future aggression once the current conflict ends.

After their daughter was among over two dozen campers and counselors killed, they joined other families to demand legislative action. The new laws, passed by the Texas Legislature, will prohibit cabins in flood zones, mandate emergency warning systems, and improve communication infrastructure, aiming to prevent similar preventable tragedies in the future.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has filed a lawsuit against the AI company Midjourney, alleging that its image-generating tool infringes on copyrights by creating digital replicas of iconic characters like Superman and Batman. This legal action aligns Warner Bros. with Disney and Universal, who previously filed a similar suit, escalating the battle between major Hollywood studios and AI developers. The studios contend that Midjourney built its business by unlawfully training its AI on their protected intellectual property.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones described the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons as being "based on mathematics." He explained that the significant financial resources required for Parsons' historic contract with the Green Bay Packers could be more effectively allocated to sign multiple top-level players. Jones argued that this approach improves the team's overall depth and reduces the risk associated with concentrating a large portion of the salary cap on a single player.</p>

This new focus has also seen her championing significant legislation, such as the Take It Down Act, which criminalized the non-consensual sharing of intimate AI-generated or real images.</p>

The request comes after lower courts blocked the president's attempt to fire her, upholding statutory tenure protections that grant agency members a degree of independence. The administration is challenging a 1935 Supreme Court precedent, arguing the modern FTC's powers justify presidential removal authority.</p>
