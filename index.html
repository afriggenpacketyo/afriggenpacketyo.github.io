          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that occurred over the July 4th holiday. The Guadalupe River rose a staggering 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night, leading to a catastrophic situation while many residents were asleep. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly admitted the county lacks a river warning system and that the severity of the flood was entirely unanticipated, despite the region's history of flooding. The event has raised questions about emergency preparedness and the effectiveness of weather warnings in the area.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as a violent civil war, a perspective he believes is often overlooked due to a sanitized, romanticized view of history. He argues that the nation's founding ideals emerged from immense turmoil and division, making them even more inspiring. Burns emphasizes that understanding the founders' flaws and the era's conflicts provides a more authentic and powerful connection to the past. He suggests this complex history offers lessons for navigating contemporary political polarization by reminding Americans of their shared capacity to overcome deep divisions.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bogota have arrested Elder José Arteaga Hernández, the alleged mastermind behind the June 7th shooting of Colombian senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay. The attack, which occurred in broad daylight at a park, left Uribe in intensive care and injured two others. Arteaga, who has a criminal history spanning over 20 years, faces charges including attempted aggravated homicide. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, but the incident has been widely condemned as a threat to Colombia's democracy, evoking the country's dark history of political violence.</p>

          <p>More than 20 individuals were arrested in London's Parliament Square on Saturday during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. The Metropolitan Police stated the arrests were for suspected offenses under the act, as expressing support for the group is now a criminal offense. The ban follows a campaign by Palestine Action involving direct action and criminal damage against arms companies, notably causing an estimated £7 million in damages at RAF Brize Norton. The group's supporters argue the ban is an authoritarian abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for an email claiming a new spending bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the communication as "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, phased-out deduction for seniors.

          <p>One year after Labour's 2024 election victory, a focus group of their voters in Kent expressed widespread disappointment with the party's performance. Participants felt the government has not delivered on key promises, particularly concerning immigration, and many felt "lied to." The recent chaos in Parliament and repeated U-turns on policy have reinforced a perception that the government lacks direction. This sentiment has created an opening for Reform UK, with some former Labour voters now considering supporting Nigel Farage's party in a future election, reflecting a significant souring of the public mood.</p>

These threats are seen as a tool to intimidate and silence opposition, creating a climate of fear.

The perception of President Trump as an unpredictable leader could lead Pyongyang to conclude that denuclearization is not a viable path to security. Experts suggest this development will likely push North Korea to further invest in making its nuclear arsenal more mobile and resilient, effectively ending any remaining possibility of disarmament.

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the alcohol-free drink can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The beverage typically combines ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical professionals are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients, either individually or combined, can significantly lower cortisol levels. While the drink is generally harmless and can aid hydration, doctors caution that it is not a substitute for proven stress-management techniques like quality sleep, exercise, and maintaining social connections.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been rediscovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of computing, as it solved the immense challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. Its ingenious design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean input methods. The discovery highlights a pivotal moment in preserving East Asian languages in the digital age.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change negative public perceptions of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team temporarily captures sharks to analyze their stomach contents, which provides vital data on the animals' health and the quality of their marine environment. The research aims to demonstrate that healthy shark populations are indicative of a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination, researchers note that securing financial support for shark conservation and study remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea for a new "America Party," suggesting it could strategically focus on a small number of key congressional races to gain influence. He posited that winning just two or three Senate seats and a handful of House districts could be enough to act as a deciding vote on contentious legislation, given the current razor-thin margins in Congress. The proposal comes amid a public feud between Musk and President Trump over a new spending bill, which prompted Musk to threaten the creation of a third party to challenge the two-party system.</p>

However, with the country still largely closed off, it is uncertain who will visit.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's decision to skip the BRICS summit in Brazil has fueled speculation about potential internal political turmoil and fractures within the economic bloc. While the official reason given was a "scheduling conflict," some analysts suggest it may signal Xi's weakening control or rising tensions with other member nations like India. The absence is notable as BRICS, which has expanded to include several new members, aims to position itself as a counterweight to Western economic dominance, though it remains plagued by divergent interests among its members.

A clause in their lease prohibited negative reviews, but such "gag clauses" are illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). The law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation or financial penalties. This case highlights a broader issue of companies attempting to unlawfully silence criticism, and it serves as a reminder for consumers to know their rights and report violations to agencies like the FTC.</p>

The article argues that for individuals facing homelessness, disability, language barriers, or lack of internet access, the bureaucratic burden of proving employment or exemption will be nearly impossible to overcome. The author contends that these requirements are effectively designed to disenfranchise people from care they are entitled to, leading to millions losing insurance and safety-net hospitals facing financial disaster.

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for living a more fulfilled life. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued distress is a result of consciously or unconsciously rerunning the negative thought. By allowing oneself this brief window to feel upset and then choosing to refocus, individuals can prevent themselves from getting stuck in a cycle of rumination and more quickly recover from life's upsets.</p>
