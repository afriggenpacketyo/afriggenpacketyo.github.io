          <p>Family offices, which cater to the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth but struggling to find qualified money managers due to trust issues and competition from other financial institutions. According to Deloitte, there were 8,030 family offices managing $3.1 trillion in assets as of last September, and this number is expected to increase to 10,720 with $5.4 trillion in assets by 2030. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, leading to challenges in finding professionals willing to work in less structured environments. To attract talent, some family offices are offering higher compensation packages and incentives like co-investment opportunities.</p>

Counter-terrorism police are investigating a blaze at the prime minister's London home, considering the possibility of involvement by a hostile state.

          <p>President Trump announced he would lift sanctions on Syria before a meeting with its interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia, a move celebrated in Damascus. The sanctions had previously blocked foreign financing, including aid, to Syria during Bashar al-Assad's regime. Al-Sharaa has called for the removal of HTS from the list of terrorist organizations. Despite promises to protect ethnic minorities, concerns remain due to clashes between security forces and Assad loyalists, as well as conflicts between Islamist armed factions and religious minorities.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washingtonâ€™s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to Iranian officials. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with international oversight. This proposal differs from the 2015 nuclear deal by being permanent and including on-the-ground representatives from other countries, potentially addressing concerns of both Iran and the United States.</p>

          <p>Even as the United States and China ease trade tensions, Beijing is preparing for continued rivalry with Washington, focusing on economic and diplomatic opportunities in Asia while maintaining a firm stance on territorial claims. China's approach includes presenting itself as a stable alternative for economic cooperation while simultaneously asserting its regional ambitions, particularly in disputed territories. A recent Chinese national security white paper warned of increasing threats to China's frontier regions and criticized the strengthening of military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite potential economic benefits from easing trade disputes, deep distrust remains between China and the United States.</p>

          <p>A UNICEF report indicates that children in Japan continue to struggle with poor mental health, ranking 32nd among 43 developed and emerging nations due to high suicide rates and other factors. Although the country improved from 37th in 2020, the suicide rate among Japanese youth remains the fourth highest among wealthy states surveyed. In contrast, Japan ranked first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills, improving from previous rankings. Experts suggest that there is a lack of awareness about children's mental health issues in Japan and that government measures have been ineffective.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team inadvertently opened the door for prosecutors to introduce new evidence regarding a prior dispute with her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in Aruba, potentially portraying the case as a "domestic violence homicide." Text messages revealed Read's flirtations with another man and complaints about O'Keefe, leading prosecutors to argue they can now present evidence contradicting Read's claims about the Aruba incident. The prosecution intends to call witnesses to testify about Read's alleged rage and accusations of an affair, which could demonstrate intent, opportunity, or preparation in O'Keefe's death. The trial centers on charges that Read struck O'Keefe with her car and left him to die during a blizzard.</p>

Buttigieg's remarks followed a town hall in Iowa, amid speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run. He affirmed that Biden was cognitively sound during their time working together, particularly during the Baltimore bridge collapse.

          <p>A House committee session to consider Medicaid cuts and other domestic policy measures faced disruptions from protesters, leading to arrests and heated debates between Republicans and Democrats. The committee discussed a bill extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, rolling back clean energy subsidies, and altering nutrition assistance. Democrats opposed the Medicaid cuts, highlighting the potential loss of health insurance coverage for millions. The debates centered on the scope and impact of the proposed cuts, with Republicans arguing they would control rising costs and Democrats accusing them of jeopardizing healthcare for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals from the Israeli government, an internal analysis indicates that Palestinians in Gaza face widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are restored, with some Israeli military officials privately acknowledging the looming crisis. The analysis contradicts Israel's public stance that its blockade on food and fuel does not pose a major threat to civilian life. Aid agencies warn that most bakeries have shut down, charity kitchens are closing, and the U.N.'s World Food Program has run out of food stocks. The analysis has exposed a gap between Israel's public stance and its private deliberations, prompting calls for immediate action to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
