          <h2>Trump Administration Appeals Order to Return Mistakenly Deported Man</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 ruling protecting him from deportation. Government lawyers argue that the judge lacks the authority to compel the Executive branch to engage with a foreign power in this manner, likening it to ordering an end to the war in Ukraine. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that the government has taken no action to rectify its error, while the White House maintains he is an MS-13 gang member, a claim his attorneys deny. A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, was placed on leave after conceding the deportation was a mistake. </p>

          <p>The new tax year brings financial changes for carers and pensioners in the UK, with the state pension rising by 4.1% and benefits increasing by 1.7%. Carers can now work longer without losing their allowance, and families whose babies need neonatal care are entitled to additional time off work. However, concerns remain about some individuals being forced to repay the carer's allowance after slightly exceeding the earnings threshold. While pensioners receive a bigger increase than current price rises, benefits are going up at a slower rate. </p>

          <p>Newly-qualified medical students in the UK are facing uncertainty as they are being assigned "placeholder jobs" by the NHS, leaving them unsure of their specific work locations until weeks before starting. This system, implemented to address concerns about fairness, has resulted in a higher proportion of students not receiving their preferred placements. The British Medical Association criticizes the government's failure to plan for an increase in medical school places without a corresponding increase in foundation jobs. This uncertainty is causing stress and may lead some doctors to consider working abroad. </p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Anna Paulina Luna have reached an agreement to address proxy voting for new parents in the House of Representatives, ending a week-long legislative standstill. The agreement formalizes "vote pairing," allowing an absent member to coordinate with a present member on the opposite side to offset the absence, but the absent member's vote is not recorded. Luna will not pursue her bipartisan discharge petition to allow remote voting for new parents. Johnson is also exploring ways to improve accessibility for new mothers in Congress, such as adding a nursing room near the House floor. </p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs, including a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports, have taken effect, triggering collection at ports of entry. Trump urges Americans to "hang tough," calling the tariffs an "economic revolution" aimed at revitalizing manufacturing and creating jobs. However, the announcement has sent global markets plummeting, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq experiencing their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on U.S. imports. </p>

He emphasized that the tariffs are "coming" and that the White House is not considering an extension of the start deadline. Lutnick believes the president needs to reset global trade, addressing the trade deficit. His comments echo those of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who also affirmed the administration's commitment to imposing the tariffs.

          <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his opposition to tariffs exceeding 10% in a social media post. Druckenmiller has consistently opposed tariffs above this threshold, viewing them as a consumption tax. His statement distances himself from President Trump's sweeping tariff plan, which imposes rates as high as 50% and a baseline rate of 10% on most countries. Stock prices have fallen sharply following Trump's tariff announcement.

He advises against selling at current levels, suggesting instead to buy non-tariffed winners.

Cramer places odds on various scenarios, including a 25% chance of a bottom, a 50% chance of standing pat with cash, and a 25% chance of a severe recession.
