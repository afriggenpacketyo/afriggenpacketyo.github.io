          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to become the world's dominant manufacturing base, leveraging exports and economic warfare tactics. The article states that in 2020, Xi called for China to tighten international production chains' dependence on the country, creating leverage against foreign tariffs and disruptions. China has weaponized its supply chain by imposing export controls on critical minerals, impacting industries from automobiles to defense. While China still relies on Western technology, its assertive economic strategy marks a significant challenge to the United States' global leadership and may cleave the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and implement mass layoffs due to lack of congressional authorization. The ruling, siding with unions and local governments, halts the administration's efforts to eliminate duplicate roles and automate tasks. Judge Illston emphasized that while the President can seek changes, large-scale reorganizations require legislative cooperation. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to overhaul the federal government, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for over five decades and is now slowly spiraling back towards Earth. While the spacecraft was designed with a protective heat shield, its exact landing location remains unknown, though it is predicted to enter between 52 degrees north and south latitude. Experts believe that the risk of injuries on the ground is low, but the re-entry event could be visible as a bright streak across the night sky.</p>

          <p>Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, is set to reveal new plans to reduce UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The proposals are expected to include employers demonstrating investment in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, visa restrictions for nationalities with high overstay rates, and a longer waiting period for migrants to apply for permanent residency. Tougher English language requirements and enforcement of new rules for international care worker recruitment are also anticipated. Additionally, the government is reviewing the application of the "right to a family life" in immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors released records detailing key moments in a corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, which was later abandoned by the Trump administration. The documents, including search warrants and sworn statements, shed light on the investigation into Adams’s fundraising and connections to the Turkish government. The investigation began in August 2021 and focused on the mayor's fundraising. One affidavit suggests agents considered seizing Adams’s electronic devices at the NYC Marathon. Critics alleged a quid pro quo between Adams and the Trump administration, trading dismissal of the case for immigration policy concessions.</p>

As Israel plans an expanded offensive in Gaza, families hope the troops will prioritize rescuing hostages.

The living hostages are men in their 20s or 30s, apart from Omri Miran who turned 48 in April. Of the 35 whose bodies Israel has confirmed are being held in Gaza, nearly all are men who were between 19 and 86 years old when they died. Three are women.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to increase the deportation force by 20,000 officers, potentially leading to a significant expansion of immigration enforcement. The proclamation calls for deputizing state and local law enforcement officers, former federal officers, and other individuals. The administration is also pushing for migrants to leave the country voluntarily through "Project Homecoming," offering financial assistance for self-deportation. Those who do not comply could face fines, wage garnishment, and confiscation of personal property.</p>
