          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful, declaring the actions "null and void". The decision orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and criticizes the administration's use of force and threats to take over USIP headquarters. The judge emphasized that USIP is an independent think tank supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches, and the President lacks constitutional authority over it. Following the decision, USIP expressed its eagerness to resume its programs.</p>

Luvu was penalized multiple times for jumping over the line of scrimmage during a game against the Eagles, highlighting the challenges defenses face in stopping the play. The proposal to ban the tush push requires 24 votes to pass, but a previous vote was evenly split.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with removing Temporary Protected Status from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants, potentially leading to their deportation. The court's order was brief and provided no reasoning, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noting she would have denied the administration's request. The ruling affects a large number of Venezuelans currently living in the United States legally under a Biden-era program. The justices also suggested some Venezuelans may be able to challenge their deportations if they received documentation of their legal status before the program's termination.</p>

          <p>The Senate is expected to vote on a crypto regulation bill after Democratic opposition previously stalled the measure over concerns about ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family. The GENIUS Act would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency linked to assets like the U.S. dollar. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, supports the bill, calling it a "meaningful step forward," but Senator Elizabeth Warren has voiced concerns that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. The bill's future in the Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Manchester City midfielder Jack Grealish may need to seek a transfer this summer, according to former City goalkeeper Shay Given, due to limited playing time. Grealish, a record signing for the club, has struggled to secure regular starts and was an unused substitute in recent FA Cup finals. Given criticized his treatment, suggesting he is not being utilized to his full potential and the "writing is on the wall". With Kevin de Bruyne potentially leaving, Grealish could be a replacement in the middle but his lack of starts may push him to look for a new club.</p>
