          <p>Young adults in Shanghai are increasingly driving the city's nighttime economy through their passion for live performances. This trend sees Gen Z dedicating a significant portion of their expenses to attending multiple weekly shows, socializing, and collecting memorabilia. The Shanghai government is actively supporting this cultural shift with its "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, aiming to boost consumption and stimulate the domestic economy. These measures are part of a broader strategy to counter deflationary pressures and strengthen demand.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a potential U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, key European allies have jointly stated that any peace negotiations must involve Ukraine. The statement from the UK, France, Germany, and others came in response to reports that President Trump might hold bilateral talks with Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected any agreements made without Kyiv's participation, particularly concerning territorial exchanges. European leaders expressed concern about being excluded from decisions impacting their continent's security.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA over a tribute to former Palestinian player Suleiman al-Obeid that omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid was killed by Israeli forces while awaiting aid in Gaza. Salah, a prominent Arab athlete, pressed UEFA on social media to provide details on how, where, and why the player died. This action aligns with his previous calls for humanitarian aid and an end to the violence in the region.</p>

          <h2>Founder of Chinese Robotics Firm Unitree Predicts Major AI Leap Within Two to Three Years</h2>

          <p>The founder of Unitree, a Chinese robotics company, predicts that the field of robotics could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. This breakthrough would be marked by a robot's ability to perform a novel task, like cleaning a room, in an entirely new environment without prior specific training. While hardware is advancing, the crucial element of "AI for embodied intelligence" remains inadequate. The founder suggests that generative video models, like Google's Genie 3, might be more promising than current vision language models for achieving this goal.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills are being asked to cease all water usage, even if service has been restored, to aid in critical repairs. The outage, affecting about 9,200 households, began Tuesday after a major water control valve broke during a heatwave. Efforts to refill a 10-million-gallon tank are being hampered by ongoing consumption, which is dropping water pressure and delaying the full restoration of safe, usable water. Officials warn that continued use could significantly push back the timeline for completing repairs.</p>

          <p>Northern China is once again grappling with deadly floods during its traditional rainy season, marking the fifth major flood disaster in the region since 2012. This year's event is considered unusual because the severe storms in late July primarily impacted the northern areas of Beijing. This contrasts with previous major floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the southern parts of the capital. The recurring nature of these extreme weather events raises ongoing concerns about climate resilience and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is facing a growing and under-acknowledged threat of nuclear conflict, exacerbated by the collapse of key arms control agreements like the INF treaty. It highlights Russia's aggressive nuclear rhetoric, the development of new hypersonic missiles, and a corresponding military buildup by NATO in Europe. The author notes a stark lack of public opposition compared to the anti-nuclear movements of the 1980s, despite the Doomsday Clock being closer to midnight than ever. The piece calls for a renewed sense of urgency to halt the escalating global arms race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite an overall increase in employment among refugees in Germany, women face a threefold disadvantage due to their gender, immigrant status, and refugee experience. Studies show that two-thirds of female refugees remain unemployed after eight years, often due to childcare responsibilities, a lack of transferable qualifications, and language barriers. In contrast, male refugees find it easier to enter sectors like construction that do not require high language proficiency. Various nonprofit and government-funded projects are working to address these challenges through counseling, job fairs, and mentorship programs.</p>
