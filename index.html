          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as a swing vote. He discusses the court's ideological shift, his pivotal decisions on same-sex marriage and abortion, and his concerns about the decline of reasoned discourse in America. Kennedy also shares personal anecdotes, including a reconciliation with Justice Scalia and his views on constitutional interpretation. The article highlights his belief that "the cases swung, not me," emphasizing his consistent judicial philosophy.</p>

          <p>The Israel Premier Tech cycling team has been excluded from the upcoming Giro dell'Emilia race in Italy due to concerns over potentially disruptive pro-Palestinian protests. Organizers made the decision after similar protests repeatedly interrupted the recent Spanish Vuelta, where the team's presence sparked large demonstrations. An Italian local politician supported the exclusion, emphasizing sport's universal values.

          <p>A deadly shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others critically injured. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, with the shooter, Joshua Jahn, dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Evidence suggests anti-ICE motives, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric and ordering increased security at facilities nationwide. This attack follows previous security threats at the same Dallas location.</p>

          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is met with skepticism from dermatologists, despite anecdotal evidence from users. While some research suggests oral collagen may have an impact, experts like Dr. Emma Wedgeworth doubt its ability to specifically target skin after digestion. The article highlights that topical creams are ineffective, and advises marine collagen if taken orally. Ultimately, dermatologists recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking as more impactful for skin health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has launched a strong attack on Reform UK, describing the party as "toxic" and "unpatriotic" ahead of the Labour annual conference. Starmer criticized Reform leader Nigel Farage for "grubbing around in America" and talking down the UK. He specifically condemned Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for migrants, arguing it would "tear this country apart." This rhetoric signals Labour's strategy to position itself as a patriotic alternative to Reform.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling at a George Floyd racial justice protest in 2020, citing a "lack of judgment." This move, part of the Trump administration's efforts to purge perceived "woke" policies, has been condemned by the FBI Agents Association, which argues agents' rights were violated. The association also criticized FBI Director Kash Patel, alleging his actions weaken the Bureau. The firings highlight ongoing tensions over political expression within federal agencies.</p>

Observers suggest this brazen approach earns him perverse credit for authenticity and desensitizes the audience to events that would previously be career-ending. This article argues that Trump's "flood the zone" strategy and his supporters' embrace of his rule-breaking challenge traditional accountability mechanisms, particularly given Republican control of Congress and the Supreme Court.</p>
