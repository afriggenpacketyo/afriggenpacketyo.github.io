          <h2>Trump to Host Crypto Fundraisers Amidst Regulatory Shifts</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused dinners this month, one aimed at high-dollar political donors and another targeting meme coin millionaires, with the goal of raising millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, highlights Trump's increasing engagement with the crypto community, while the second offers access to Trump's inner circle based on holdings of the $TRUMP token. This approach has drawn criticism from watchdog groups concerned about potential corruption and foreign influence, given the pseudonymous nature of crypto wallets and the possibility of wealthy donors buying access to the president. The events reflect a broader policy shift favorable to the crypto industry under Trump-aligned appointees. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a fall of over 2% after OPEC+ nations agreed to increase production for the second consecutive month. The decision to raise output by 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' initial forecast, has contributed to concerns about an oversupplied market. These fears are compounded by potential recession risks arising from U.S. President Trump's tariffs, which could slow demand. Consequently, Goldman Sachs has lowered its forecast for U.S. crude prices, and oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production due to the current weak price environment.</p>

He emphasized the importance of sticking to principles like a strong defense, American leadership, limited government, and traditional moral values. Pence also opposed raising taxes on the wealthy and affirmed his commitment to upholding the Constitution, addressing concerns about Trump's potential pursuit of a third term.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares have seen an extraordinary increase of 5,502,284% since Warren Buffett took over in 1965, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which rose 39,054% during the same period. This translates to a compounded annual return of 19.9% for Berkshire, nearly double the 10.4% recorded by the S&P 500. Buffett's long-term investment strategy and business acumen have been pivotal in transforming Berkshire from a failing textile company into a diversified conglomerate worth nearly $1.2 trillion. This impressive performance underscores Buffett's legacy as one of the most successful investors of all time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. sanctions, Iran continues to export significant amounts of oil, primarily to China, using clandestine methods such as "shadow fleets" and ship-to-ship transfers. While the U.S. has imposed sanctions on entities facilitating Iranian oil sales, enforcement gaps, particularly in Southeast Asia, persist. The article notes that the US has lost leverage over China, the primary destination for Iranian crude, because Chinese buyers appear more cautious, mindful of the risks tied to potential US sanctions. This is due to Washington launching a sweeping tariff campaign against Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is convening this week to assess monetary policy and interest rates, potentially impacting borrowing costs for Americans. While a rate cut is unlikely for May, signals from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference could influence mortgage rates. Hints of a June rate cut might prompt lenders to preemptively lower rates, especially given cooling inflation and steady unemployment. Prospective buyers and homeowners considering refinancing should closely monitor rate fluctuations for potential opportunities, although rates are unlikely to return to the historic lows of 2020 and 2021.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are warning that potential tariffs imposed by President Trump on imported medications could lead to higher drug costs and supply disruptions, disproportionately affecting American patients. Industry experts suggest that tariffs, particularly on generic drugs, would strain already tight profit margins, potentially causing some manufacturers to exit the U.S. market. While some large drugmakers are investing in U.S. manufacturing to mitigate the impact, generic drugmakers face greater challenges due to their narrower profit margins, raising concerns about access to affordable medications.</p>

          <p>A new report by New York City Comptroller Brad Lander reveals that the city owes at least $1 billion to nonprofit organizations for over 7,000 unpaid invoices, some dating back years. These nonprofits provide critical social services, including sheltering the homeless, providing child and elder care, and counseling the mentally ill. The delays in payment are attributed to issues within the city's contracting and payment processes, including late contract registration, staffing shortages, and glitches with a new payment portal. The late payments force nonprofits to borrow money, incurring interest costs and potentially reducing services.</p>

          <p>Norwegian customs officials discovered 147 kilos of cocaine hidden in a shipment of bananas, marking the latest in a series of similar incidents worldwide. The drugs, with an estimated street value of $16.4 million, were found in nine boxes of bananas that had arrived from South America via Sweden. Authorities believe a large criminal network was behind the attempted smuggling, which was likely intended for pickup at the Antwerp port. Cocaine has been found concealed in banana shipments in several countries in recent months, highlighting the ongoing challenge of combating drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that CD interest rates will likely remain steady or decrease in May 2025, contingent on the Federal Reserve's decisions and economic factors. While a rate increase is deemed unlikely, potential rate cuts by the Fed later in the year could lead to preemptive rate drops by financial institutions. The Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting is expected to influence CD rates, with analysts closely monitoring economic indicators such as inflation and employment levels. Savers seeking optimal returns should consider locking in rates now, as future rate cuts could diminish the competitiveness of CD yields. (not investment advice)</p>
