          <h2>US Deportation of Chinese Scientist Seen as Cold War Misstep</h2>

          <p>In 1950, the U.S. deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist who had contributed significantly to American aerospace and weaponry, including work on the Manhattan Project. This decision, fueled by xenophobia during the Red Scare, had staggering implications as Qian returned to China and established its modern weapons program. By the 1980s, China could target California or Moscow with missiles, marking a technological revolution that transformed China into a superpower. The article argues this deportation was a critical American misstep that forever altered the global balance of power, especially as the Trump administration targets foreign students and researchers. The author suggests that Qian's deportation serves as a cautionary tale against xenophobic policies in science and technology, highlighting the long-term strategic costs of such actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America," following a court ruling against Trump's tariffs. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming they provided poor advice on judicial nominations and are influenced by Leo. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of federal courts and considering it a privilege to have been involved. Trump's attacks are notable due to Leo's long-standing alliance with the president, advising on Supreme Court picks and shaping lists of potential justices. This marks a significant rift between Trump and a key figure in the conservative legal movement.</p>

An EU investigation found Shein in breach of consumer protection laws due to fake discounts and misleading sustainability claims. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods and potential similar measures in the EU and U.K. have further complicated Shein's path to an IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

Japan will continue to push for the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from ten prefectures imposed after the 2011 nuclear disaster. This development marks a potential easing of tensions between the two countries, although full resumption may take months due to registration and radiation checks.</p>

The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signifies a symbolic end to an aggressive period of crypto crackdowns in the U.S., especially as the Trump administration seeks to position itself as an ally to the crypto industry.

          <p>The U.S. decision to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students, particularly those in critical fields or with Communist Party ties, has provoked backlash from both Americans and Beijing. The Chinese embassy in Washington lodged a formal diplomatic protest, calling the move politically motivated and discriminatory. Critics accuse the U.S. of xenophobia, while the State Department defends the decision as crucial for protecting national security. The situation underscores rising tensions between the two countries and concerns over academic and scientific exchanges.</p>

          <p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert argues that Israel's war in Gaza has become a war of devastation, marked by indiscriminate killing of civilians and a government policy of starvation. Olmert asserts that the government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, is now the enemy from within, causing greater damage to Israel than any external foe. He accuses the government of pursuing a policy of starvation and humanitarian pressure, potentially leading to catastrophic results. Olmert calls for an immediate halt to the war to avoid further international condemnation and potential war crimes charges.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist warns that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new arena of conflict in the US-China rivalry. While the likelihood of full-scale financial sanctions remains low, Washington could gradually expand sanctions to eventually exclude China from the US dollar system. Sanctioning China within the Swift system would inflict serious damage on the system itself, given China's prominent role in global trade and investment. This analysis highlights the growing concerns over potential financial warfare between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>
