          <p>Top tennis players are increasingly voicing concerns about the unsustainable physical demands of the tennis calendar, with Australian player Alex de Minaur citing burnout as a reason for his early French Open exit. Jack Draper previously raised concerns about the "mental" toll of the schedule, while Iga Swiatek finds the demands "pretty exhausting." Players like Casper Ruud have criticized the rankings system, with De Minaur warning that careers will be shortened due to burnout. The ATP and WTA Tours acknowledge these concerns, stating that player health and wellbeing are priorities, but a solution to alleviate the strain remains elusive.</p>

Walz's remarks, delivered in an early-voting state, suggest a potential consideration for a future presidential run, though he remains undecided about seeking a third term as governor.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that while parents in Europe find their lives more meaningful than childfree individuals, they also experience lower life satisfaction. This disparity is especially pronounced for mothers and varies across countries, with Scandinavian nations showing less difference between parents and non-parents. Factors like childcare availability, financial support, parental leave policies, and gender equality contribute to these differences. The study suggests that societal support and a shared responsibility for children's well-being positively impact parental satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, with experts attributing the trend to factors like poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. A large percentage of the population is overweight or obese, and projections estimate that one in three people in Turkey will be obese by 2030. High food price inflation and limited access to healthy foods contribute to nutritional imbalances, particularly among children. The Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, but critics argue it overlooks broader economic issues and lacks adequate guidelines for healthy eating.</p>

          <p>An analyst argues that Donald Trump's approach to China, characterized by both aggression and weakness, increases the likelihood of a war over Taiwan. Trump's punitive tariffs and hostility towards China undermine the CCP's power, potentially provoking Xi Jinping. The analyst suggests that Trump's isolationist policies and lack of commitment to defending key interests embolden China to challenge the US in Asia. This creates a vulnerable situation for Taiwan, as the US's ambiguous policy and Trump's perceived cowardice make the island a tempting target for China.</p>

          <p>A legal dispute over a major lithium project in the Democratic Republic of Congo is on hold as the US seeks to counter China's control of critical minerals. Perth-based AVZ Minerals suspended its arbitration case following US encouragement to resolve the dispute. The US is backing KoBold Metals to acquire AVZ's stake in the Manono lithium project, challenging China's Zijin Mining's control.
