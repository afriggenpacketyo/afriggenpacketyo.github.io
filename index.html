        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Rethink Priorities projects that humanity is on track to farm and slaughter nearly 6 trillion animals annually by 2033, a significant increase from 2023. This surge is primarily driven by the farming of small animals like shrimp, fish, and insects, which are increasingly used for food and feed. The article discusses the ethical implications of this trend, particularly concerning the potential sentience and welfare of invertebrates, and highlights the need for better welfare standards in the rapidly growing insect farming industry. The report suggests that while concern for these animals may seem laughable to some, it is a moral consideration that could become a tragedy if ignored.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced that consumers may see higher prices as early as this month due to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported goods. While Walmart will try to absorb some of the cost, the magnitude of the tariffs makes it impossible to fully mitigate the pressure on prices. The tariffs affect goods from China, as well as staples like bananas and coffee from countries such as Costa Rica and Colombia. Meanwhile, in Canada, Loblaw's also warned of tariff-related price increases due to retaliatory tariffs on US goods.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting U.S. citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. The justices questioned the legality of the order, with some expressing concerns about the impact of eliminating nationwide injunctions. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that national injunctions create an unfair legal playing field for the government, while Justice Sotomayor questioned whether the Supreme Court would benefit from the "percolation" of lower courts issuing opinions that would help the high court decide weighty issues over actions taken by the administration. A decision in the case is expected by early summer.</p>

Improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history can also help homeowners qualify for these borrowing products.

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned that consumers could start seeing higher prices towards the end of this month and more significantly in June due to tariffs. Despite the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days, Rainey stated that tariffs are "still too high" and that the magnitude of the increases is more than any retailer or supplier can absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.</p>

          <p>The UK economy has shown surprising resilience, with a growth rate of 0.7% in the first three months of this year, beating expectations and exceeding growth rates of other G7 advanced economies. While millions of families are still suffering from the cost of living squeeze, and small businesses face pressure, there is evidence of resilience beyond those sectors. Interest rate cuts and relative political and economic stability may have played a significant role, with real incomes up and businesses accommodating rising costs through squeezed profit margins. This positive economic outlook contrasts with earlier predictions of a UK-specific economic crisis.</p>

The statue, located near her hometown of Sevnica, was reportedly chopped off at the ankles and removed. The artist, Brad Downey, speculated that the theft may be related to Donald Trump's recent election. The original wooden statue had been carved by a local artist and placed near Sevnica during Trump's first presidential term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals a shortage of affordable homes for middle-income families, with only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March being affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income. This affordability gap is attributed to rising home prices, higher mortgage rates, and a lack of new construction following the 2006 housing crisis. The cities with the worst affordability gaps are often in regions with restrictive zoning or permitting regulations. The research suggests that easing zoning regulations and bolstering downpayment assistance programs could help spur more homebuilding and relieve the affordability crunch.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, partly due to the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks. Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed faces a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation, particularly as tariffs could slow growth and boost inflation. The Fed has been reluctant to ease policy after cutting its benchmark rate last year.</p>

The research, crowdfunded by cat lovers, also helps explain why ginger cats are more likely to be male and could shed light on whether orange colored cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.</p>

While there is a degree of political agreement that debanking is a problem, there are no easy answers to the hot topic in Washington. Conservatives argue that banks are discriminating against them for political reasons, while liberals argue that banks are shutting off access to individuals and businesses without warning. There is no legal right to a bank account, and banks are generally permitted to eschew categories of customers deemed too risky.</p>
