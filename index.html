          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a news conference to detail a plan aimed at curbing violent crime and addressing homelessness in Washington, D.C. The initiative includes deploying additional federal law enforcement officers to high-traffic areas and potentially removing homeless encampments. Trump criticized Mayor Muriel Bowser's handling of the city, claiming crime is worsening, though preliminary police data shows a decrease in overall crime this year. Bowser has pushed back, stating that her administration has successfully driven down violent crime to a 30-year low and that the president's characterizations are hyperbolic.</p>

Analysts note that the meeting, held on U.S. soil without Ukraine's initial involvement, strengthens Putin's position despite Russia's struggling economy. The prospect of the talks has positively impacted global financial markets, though defense stocks in Europe saw a decline. Experts suggest that any outcome, whether a peace deal or failed talks, could ultimately benefit European defense procurement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has declared that his country will formally recognize a Palestinian state, a decision to be finalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. This move aligns Australia with other Western nations like France, Britain, and Canada, which have signaled similar intentions amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The recognition is contingent on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no governmental role for Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza. Albanese emphasized that a two-state solution is essential for breaking the cycle of violence in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Shanghai is set to launch a comprehensive urban renewal campaign, focusing on redeveloping its 'urban villages' starting in 2026. This initiative is part of a broader three-year plan to enhance existing city infrastructure rather than pursuing large-scale expansion. The city also aims to renovate older, thin-walled housing by 2027 and continue upgrading old residential neighborhoods. This large-scale project is expected to stimulate both consumer spending and investment, reflecting China's national strategy of shifting focus towards improving the quality of urban living environments and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented agreement, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenues from specific chip sales in China to secure export licenses. The deal applies to Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market following earlier U.S. export controls. This arrangement comes after the Trump administration effectively banned sales of the H20 chip in April over national security concerns that they could bolster China's AI and military capabilities. The move signals a potential easing of trade tensions, as it allows U.S. companies to compete in the Chinese market under new financial conditions.</p>

The blaze, which occurred in the popular Holyrood Park area, was brought under control without any reported casualties. Experts note that wildfires in Scotland are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change leading to hotter, drier summers and increased vegetation growth, which acts as fuel for fires.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Everton is reportedly in advanced talks to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old England international, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, has seen his playing time diminish, making only seven league starts last season. Grealish was an integral part of City's 2022-23 Treble-winning season but has since struggled for form and fitness, falling out of favor with manager Pep Guardiola. A move to Everton could provide an opportunity for the playmaker to reignite his career after a difficult period at the Manchester club.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is being formally asked to overturn its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The challenge comes from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, who is appealing a financial penalty. Her petition argues the Obergefell ruling was 'egregiously wrong' and should be corrected, echoing Justice Clarence Thomas's call to reconsider such precedents. This appeal marks a significant moment in a renewed conservative effort to return the authority to define marriage to individual states, amid slightly softening public support for marriage equality.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread efforts, less than ten percent of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, with most ending up in landfills, incinerators, or the environment. Experts point to significant hurdles, including the thousands of different plastic types and the hazardous chemical additives used in production, which can contaminate recycling streams and degrade material quality. While some plastics like PET are easier to process, inadequate infrastructure remains a major barrier. Innovators are developing 'microfactories' to transform mixed plastic waste into valuable materials, but experts agree that meaningful progress requires global policy changes, reduced production, and corporate accountability.</p>

          <p>Revenue from President Trump's tariffs has surged, with customs and excise taxes bringing in over $29 billion in the last month alone, a significant increase from previous years. While this represents a growing source of federal income, it still constitutes a small fraction of total government revenue, which is dominated by income taxes. Proponents see tariffs as a way to pay down the national debt, but the current revenue stream is dwarfed by the nearly $37 trillion debt. Economists also note that tariff revenue might not even cover the cost of recent legislative spending bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With high temperatures and UV levels expected in the UK, understanding sunscreen labels is crucial for skin protection. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) indicates how much UVB radiation, which causes sunburn, is filtered out; SPF 30 is recommended, blocking about 97% of rays. The star rating, from one to five, measures protection against UVA radiation, which is associated with skin aging and cancer. For optimal protection, experts advise choosing a sunscreen with both a high SPF and a high star rating. It should be reapplied at least every two hours, as effectiveness diminishes with sweat and water exposure.</p>

          <h2>Indian Opposition Parties Protest Controversial Voter Roll Revision in Bihar</h2>

          <p>Opposition parties in India, led by Rahul Gandhi, held a protest against a controversial revision of the voter list in the state of Bihar ahead of key elections. They argue that the exercise, which requires strict documentation to prove citizenship, could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly from poor and minority communities who may lack the necessary paperwork. The Election Commission of India defends the revision as a routine update to ensure accuracy and remove illegal immigrants from the rolls. Critics warn the process is similar to a 2019 citizenship list in Assam that left nearly two million people at risk of statelessness.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has expanded its 'deport now, appeal later' policy to include 15 additional countries, such as Canada, India, and Australia, bringing the total to 23. This scheme allows the government to deport foreign nationals who commit crimes before their appeal against the removal is heard, with hearings conducted via video link from their home countries. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the expansion is intended to fast-track removals and prevent criminals from exploiting the immigration system. The government argues this will also help alleviate severe overcrowding in prisons across England and Wales.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker, has temporarily halted production at its lithium mine in Yichun, China, after its license expired. The company has applied for a renewal, but the pause is seen by some analysts as part of a broader effort by Beijing to manage overcapacity in the EV battery industry. The halt caused lithium carbonate futures to surge, highlighting the market's sensitivity to supply disruptions. A sustained increase in lithium prices could significantly impact CATL's profit margins and the overall cost of electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating mudslide in Danyor, a town in Pakistan's northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, has killed seven volunteers and injured three others. The victims were repairing a drainage channel that had been damaged by recent flash floods when the slide occurred. The region has been battered by extreme weather, including a glacial lake outburst flood that damaged the crucial Karakoram Highway, disrupting trade with China. Experts attribute the increasing frequency of such events to climate change accelerating glacier melt in Pakistan's mountains, making the area highly vulnerable to landslides and floods.</p>

          <p>The UK's conditional pledge to recognize a Palestinian state highlights the complex status of Palestine, which is recognized by 147 UN members but lacks defined borders, a capital, or full sovereignty due to Israeli occupation. Recognition by Western powers like the UK is largely symbolic but carries significant political and moral weight, referencing historical responsibilities like the 1917 Balfour Declaration. The move reflects growing international pressure and a shift in public opinion due to the war in Gaza. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu strongly opposes it, the trend could further isolate the U.S. in its stance on the issue.</p>
