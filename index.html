            <p>A federal judge is considering blocking President Trump's executive order targeting Susman Godfrey, the law firm representing Dominion Voting Systems. The firm argues that Trump's order, which seeks to block their access to government buildings and contracts, is unconstitutional and retaliatory for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 election, including securing a large settlement from Fox News. Nine major law firms have agreed to provide legal services to causes supported by Trump, while three others are fighting the action in federal courts. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and legal entities challenging its actions.</p>

The article compares Trump's approach to authoritarianism with that of Bukele and Viktor Orbán, noting the tension between showy displays of might and subtle legal manipulation. Trump's actions, such as sending alleged gang members to a Salvadoran prison and attempting to control American universities, reflect a blend of both styles.

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a policy to fast-track asylum cases by allowing immigration judges to reject 'legally deficient' claims without a hearing. This directive aims to reduce the backlog in immigration courts, but critics argue it could harm those without legal representation. The policy could lead to more deportation orders being issued before individuals have a chance to present their case in court. Experts also point out that asylum cases are complex and require thorough consideration, making the fast-tracking process potentially detrimental to asylum seekers.</p>

            <p>Amazon is reaching out to its third-party merchants to assess the impact of President Trump's tariffs on their businesses, focusing on sourcing, pricing, logistics, and shipping strategies. The levies on goods from China could disproportionately affect the millions of businesses that rely on Amazon's third-party marketplace, as they source many products from China. While some sellers plan to maintain prices to stay competitive, the tariffs could ultimately force them out of business. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggested that some sellers may pass the costs onto consumers.</p>

            <p>The U.S. attorney general declined to comment on the legality of President Trump's proposal to send U.S. citizens to prisons in El Salvador. Trump suggested that 'homegrown criminals' could be sent to El Salvador, where the U.S. already pays $6 million to house alleged gang members. Legal experts have stated that the idea is illegal and unconstitutional, as there is no provision under U.S. law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country.</p>

However, mortgage rates remain higher than in previous years, and competition for homes is fierce. This increase in low-deposit options provides a boost for those struggling to save for a larger down payment.</p>
