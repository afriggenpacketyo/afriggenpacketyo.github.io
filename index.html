          <h2>Opinion Piece Alleges Obama Administration Knowingly Framed Trump as a Russian Asset</h2>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that newly declassified documents reveal the Obama administration and its national security team deliberately fabricated intelligence to portray Donald Trump as a Russian agent. The author, Gregg Jarrett, claims this was done to distract from Hillary Clinton's email controversy, citing a plan allegedly approved by Clinton and briefed to top officials by then-CIA Director John Brennan. The piece argues this constituted a "treasonous conspiracy" and an abuse of power, leading to the "Crossfire Hurricane" investigation and the appointment of a special counsel despite the Steele dossier being debunked.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat named Wonder Seas, carrying 53 people, capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden storm, resulting in at least 34 fatalities, including eight children. Most of the passengers were Vietnamese families from Hanoi. Rescue efforts, hampered by heavy rain, managed to save 11 people, including a 10-year-old boy who survived in an air pocket. The Vietnamese government has expressed condolences and promised a thorough investigation into the cause of the tragic accident to handle any violations strictly.</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville has voluntarily recalled more than 67,000 cases of its Power Stick roll-on antiperspirant deodorants due to manufacturing process deviations. The recall, issued through the FDA, affects three different scents of the product sold at major retailers including Walmart, Amazon, and Dollar Tree. The issue was cited as a "cGMP deviation," meaning it did not follow Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. The company has provided specific lot numbers for consumers to identify the affected products, though no other products from the brand are impacted.</p>

This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows a recent trend of Huang divesting stock as Nvidia's market capitalization has surged past $4 trillion, driven by high demand for its AI-powering chips.

          <h2>Trump Comments That Releasing Epstein Files Will Not Satisfy Critics</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that unsealing the grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell criminal cases would not be enough to satisfy "the troublemakers and radical left lunatics." His comments on social media came after the Department of Justice, at his request, asked federal judges to release the documents amid mounting public pressure. Trump suggested that even with full court approval for the release, his critics would simply demand "more, more, more," signaling that he may not take further action on the matter.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's neurotechnology company, Neuralink, was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) in an April filing with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This designation is intended to help businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals gain preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, and that the company has never applied for or received any federal benefits.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has announced the official launch of a massive dam project in Tibet, which is anticipated to become the world's largest hydroelectric facility. The dam is being built on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, which flows from Tibet into India and Bangladesh where it is known as the Brahmaputra. The project, located in the city of Nyingchi, has raised significant concerns in downstream countries, particularly India, over water security and environmental impact. The plan was first announced in 2020 as part of China's strategy to harness the region's hydropower.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's tariff policies shows mixed results, with the economy avoiding a recession despite initial fears. Economists note that the tariffs have generated significant tax revenue, potentially exceeding $300 billion by the end of 2025, and have prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, critics caution that these corporate commitments are uncertain due to the policy's fluctuating nature and legal challenges. Additionally, the tariffs have contributed to price increases in some consumer goods, posing an inflation risk that could impact the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. has issued a recall for more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco" brand ready-to-eat sweet apple chicken sausage. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the recall after the company received three consumer complaints about finding pieces of white plastic in the product. The affected items were produced on June 28, 2025, and distributed nationwide. While no injuries have been reported, the Food Safety and Inspection Service advises consumers to either discard the products or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential fallout if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, an unprecedented move that would likely trigger a significant legal battle. Experts say the legal standard for removing a Fed chair "for cause" is extremely high and the case would probably reach the Supreme Court. Such an action could destabilize financial markets, undermine the central bank's independence, and potentially lead to higher inflation and interest rates if the Fed's credibility is damaged. The piece also explores the political motivations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway claims that the worst piece of career advice, often given by the already wealthy, is to "follow your passion." Instead, he advocates for a more pragmatic approach: finding the intersection of what you are good at and what can be profitable. Galloway suggests that success comes from enduring rejection and pivoting when necessary, rather than blindly pursuing a passion. This sentiment is echoed by Mastercard's CEO, who advises young people to identify their unique strengths and combine them with their passions to find a viable and fulfilling career path.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This feature article explores the recent comeback of tanning, linking its renewed popularity to a broader anti-establishment and alternative-health ideology. It notes that public figures in the MAHA movement, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appear to favor a pro-sun stance, questioning mainstream advice on sun avoidance and sunscreen. This perspective aligns with online wellness influencers who promote sunlight as a natural cure-all and are skeptical of "Big Pharma." The trend signifies a cultural shift where tanning becomes an act of defiance against scientific and health institutions.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific arm. The move is part of a broader restructuring that will also reduce the agency's workforce by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees, since January. The administration claims the changes will save money and allow the agency to focus on its core mission. However, critics and union leaders argue that gutting the EPA's scientific foundation will "devastate public health" and have generational impacts on environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Much of the United Kingdom is under yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, with the Met Office cautioning about potential flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts remain possible. The alerts extend across all four nations for Saturday and continue into Sunday and Monday for parts of England and Scotland. The risk of flooding is heightened because the recent heatwave has left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall.</p>
