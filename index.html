          <h2>Financial Pressures and Shifting Viewer Habits Fuel Concerns Over Future of Late-Night Television</h2>

          <p>The cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" has intensified discussions about the viability of late-night television amid evolving media consumption and financial strain. While CBS cited significant financial losses for the decision, the move highlights broader industry pressures from declining linear TV ad revenue and the high costs of production. The future of other mainstays like "Jimmy Kimmel Live" is now under scrutiny, as networks re-evaluate the profitability of these programs in an era dominated by streaming and digital content. Industry experts are watching to see if this is an isolated event or the beginning of a larger trend away from the traditional late-night format.</p>

          <p>Wyandotte County Sheriff's Deputy Elijah Ming, a 34-year-old and nine-year veteran of the force, was shot and killed in Kansas City, Kansas. The incident occurred as he responded to a domestic violence call, assisting a woman who was attempting to move out of a residence. The suspect allegedly opened fire without warning as officers approached, striking Ming. After a brief standoff where the suspect continued to fire at responding officers, he was wounded by return fire and taken into custody. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is now leading the probe into the fatal shooting.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a new trade agreement, averting the threat of a transatlantic trade war. The deal establishes a 15% baseline tariff for most EU exports to the U.S., which is higher than previous levels but avoids a more severe 30% tariff threatened by President Trump. However, significant exceptions remain, including a steep 50% tariff on steel exports and the complete exclusion of pharmaceuticals, which may face future punitive measures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the agreement as a significant step towards providing stability and predictability for the world's two largest economies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis suggests that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's decision to weaken the country's anti-corruption agencies is linked to a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy. The article argues that the Trump administration has actively dismantled the global anti-corruption framework that previous administrations supported, sending a signal to leaders worldwide that the pressure for transparent governance is off. This policy change, exemplified by paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the defunding of democracy-promoting agencies, has created a new global paradigm. This environment has allegedly emboldened leaders, including Zelensky, to roll back anti-graft measures that were previously established under U.S. and international pressure.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to immediately suspend all U.S. funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed grave concerns over the GHF's operations, which rely on armed contractors and have been linked to over 700 Palestinian deaths at distribution sites. They argue that the U.S. should resume support for established UN-led aid mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure aid reaches civilians safely. The move comes as the UN warns of a deepening starvation crisis in Gaza and allies criticize the GHF's methods as a "death trap."</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by CBS News and The Marshall Project has uncovered alarming issues with the routine drug testing of pregnant patients in U.S. hospitals. The report found that urine drug tests can have false positive rates as high as 50%, leading to devastating consequences for expectant mothers, including potential involvement from child protective services. These tests are administered to thousands of pregnant patients, often without their explicit knowledge of the potential for inaccurate results. The findings raise serious questions about the reliability and ethical implications of this widespread medical practice and its impact on families.</p>

Instead, Putin marked the holiday by observing drills from the naval headquarters.

          <h2>UK Conservatives Propose Ban on Strikes for All NHS Doctors</h2>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch announced that her party would introduce legislation to ban all NHS doctors from taking strike action if they win the next election. The proposal would place doctors under the same restrictive minimum service level requirements as police and military personnel, effectively blocking widespread industrial action. The announcement came as resident doctors began a five-day strike over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) called the proposal a "desperate intervention," defending the right to strike as a last resort and arguing that doctors' pay has significantly declined in real terms over the last fifteen years.</p>

          <p>A significant fire has broken out in the West Midlands, involving four factory units and an estimated 20 tonnes of tyres. Over 70 firefighters and 17 fire engines were dispatched to the scene on Great Bridge Street, between Tipton and West Bromwich. The blaze has sent a large, thick plume of smoke into the air, visible for miles, and prompted the precautionary evacuation of several nearby homes. West Midlands Fire Service has reported no casualties but noted a partial building collapse, requesting a structural engineer to the site as crews work to contain the fire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's weekend golf trip to his Turnberry resort in Scotland was met with protests from dozens of demonstrators. While security kept the protestors at a distance from the president, they gathered with signs to send a clear message that he was not welcome. One protestor told reporters that the community was united in their opposition to him. The demonstrations occurred as Trump played a round of golf ahead of scheduled trade talks with EU officials. Similar protests also took place at the U.S. Consulate in Edinburgh, criticizing both the president and a recent UK trade deal.</p>

          <p>A growing cybersecurity threat known as "quishing" is using malicious QR codes to scam millions of Americans. Hackers place fake QR code stickers on everything from parking meters to promotional flyers, tricking people into scanning them. These codes can lead to phishing websites designed to steal personal and financial information or download malware onto a device. The ubiquity of QR codes in daily life, combined with the urgency of situations like paying for parking, makes this a particularly effective scam.

          <p>According to a BBC analysis, Israel's recent announcement of a "tactical pause" and aid airdrops in Gaza is likely a political gesture aimed at appeasing key international allies. The move follows stark condemnation from countries like Britain, France, and Germany, who have blamed Israel for the growing starvation crisis. While Israel maintains it does not restrict aid, its claims are not accepted by the UN or its allies. The analysis argues that these new measures, particularly airdrops, are an inefficient last resort and do little to address the root cause of the humanitarian catastrophe, which requires a full ceasefire and unrestricted land access for aid convoys.</p>
