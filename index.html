          <h2>Judge Rules Against Deporting Migrants to Libya Without Due Process</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 23:34:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting migrants to Libya or Saudi Arabia without allowing them to raise safety concerns violates an existing court order. The ruling came after lawyers for a group of migrants filed an emergency motion, citing reports and accounts alleging they were being prepared for removal to Libya or Saudi Arabia on military aircraft. Judge Murphy clarified that any such removals would defy his preliminary injunction, which bars deporting noncitizens to countries other than their origin without due process. The judge's order emphasized the significant risks faced by those deported to Libya, including imprisonment, torture, and death, referencing the U.S. State Department's travel advisory against travel to Libya due to "crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a forthcoming "major trade deal" with the UK, marking the first such agreement since his administration imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners. The announcement, made via Truth Social, lacked specific details, but reports suggest the deal aims to lower British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as reduce taxes on US technology companies. UK officials have prioritized a separate agreement with the EU, which is likely to align British standards with European ones, potentially complicating negotiations with the US. The US had imposed tariffs on several trading partners on April 2, before partially reversing course following market downturns, but the UK was not hit with reciprocal tariffs due to a trade surplus with the US.</p>

          <p>Public transportation providers and police in Japan are implementing AI to enhance lost-and-found services, improving the rate at which lost items are returned to their owners. Find Inc.'s "lost-and-found platform" uses AI to categorize and catalog lost items based on photos taken by staff, enabling owners to inquire through messaging apps by providing information or similar-looking images. Keio Corp., a railway operator, has seen its return rate increase from less than 10% to 30% after adopting the system, which has also reduced inquiry times for staff. The platform, launched in June 2023, has handled approximately 1.5 million lost items, returning around 480,000 to their owners.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea fired multiple presumed short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters. The missiles, launched from near Monsanto, flew up to 800 kilometers before landing in the sea, prompting close communication between South Korea, the United States, and Japan. Experts suggest the launch may be a test of missiles intended for export, particularly to Russia for use in the Ukraine conflict. North Korea's ballistic missile program is banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions, but the country has continued to develop missiles of all ranges.</p>

The bootcamp, run by startup founders Sherry Jiang and Agrim Singh, focuses on creating functional apps in 48 hours using AI tools. The individual created an AI-powered negotiation trainer, highlighting that the process is more about patience and instruction than coding itself. The rise of AI in coding may lead to increased productivity for software engineers and a potential decrease in hiring costs for startups.</p>

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, has been charged with federal hate crimes for allegedly assaulting Jewish protesters at demonstrations in Manhattan. Prosecutors say that on three separate occasions, Bazrouk kicked and punched Jewish protesters wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags. The incidents occurred over a nine-month period, with arrests made after each assault, but Bazrouk allegedly continued his violent behavior. A search of his cellphone revealed pro-Hamas propaganda and messages in which he identified himself as a “Jew hater,” according to prosecutors, who are seeking justice for victims of hate crimes and will aggressively prosecute those who spread bigotry and discrimination through violence.</p>

Catalytic converter theft has become increasingly common due to the ease of stealing the parts, their lack of identifying markings, and their high value due to the precious metals they contain.

          <p>British marathon runner Holly Archer responded to critics who questioned her attire during the London Marathon, where she wore running briefs. Some social media users claimed she looked "uncomfortable" or should have worn more clothes, while others compared her outfit to a swimsuit. Archer addressed the criticism by highlighting the humid conditions during the race, where humidity reached nearly 78 percent and temperatures climbed into the mid-70s. Over 56,000 participants completed the London Marathon this year.</p>

          <p>Three college presidents from institutions outside the Ivy League apologized for not acting more aggressively to curb antisemitism on their campuses during a House committee hearing. The hearing, titled “Beyond the Ivies,” focused on schools that received F grades from the Anti-Defamation League. Republican lawmakers threatened to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools, while Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of tolerating antisemitism in their own party. The hearing reflected a shift in higher education's relationship with the federal government, with universities tightening rules on protests and facing increased scrutiny from the Trump administration.</p>
