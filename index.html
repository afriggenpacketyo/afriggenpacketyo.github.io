          <p>England's white-ball cricket team experienced a significant setback under new captain Harry Brook, suffering a seven-wicket thrashing by South Africa at Headingley. After a promising start, the English side collapsed, getting bowled out for a mere 131 runs, with the last seven wickets falling for just 29 runs. South Africa chased down the total with ease, winning with nearly 30 overs to spare, raising concerns about the team's direction following their poor 2023 World Cup performance. The performance was described as one of the worst in recent years for the team.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program, which permitted Prime members to share their free shipping benefits with individuals outside their own household. The company has begun notifying users that the program will end on October 1, 2025, directing them towards the more restrictive Amazon Family feature instead. Under the new rules, all users sharing benefits must reside at the same primary address. This policy change comes amid reports that Amazon's Prime membership growth in the U.S. has not met internal targets for the year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has barred President Donald Trump from deploying the National Guard or other military forces for domestic law enforcement activities within California. Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the administration's previous deployment of troops in Los Angeles willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. The injunction, which is currently limited to California, was issued in response to a lawsuit from the state challenging the use of troops to manage immigration-related protests.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has commenced deliberations in the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of orchestrating a plot to violently overthrow the democratic order and retain power after his 2022 election loss. The charges stem from the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings in Brasília by his supporters, just after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's inauguration. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face a prison sentence of more than 40 years, marking the first time a former Brazilian president has been tried on coup charges.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have signed an open letter defending the independence of the Federal Reserve and supporting Governor Lisa Cook. The letter comes in response to President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Cook from her position over unproven allegations, an action the economists warn erodes trust in a key financial institution. They argue that the central bank was designed to be insulated from day-to-day politics to ensure credible monetary policy, a principle threatened by the administration's recent actions.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a phenomenon of "reverse flow" migration, with over 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, turning back from their journey towards the United States. The report, supported by the U.N., attributes this trend to the Trump administration's hardline border enforcement policies, which have led to a 97% drop in northward migration this year. Many of these returning migrants now find themselves stranded in Central American countries without resources, facing exploitation and abuse as humanitarian aid in the region has also diminished.</p>

          <p>Constant Mutamba, the former justice minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of embezzling $19 million in public funds. A high court found him guilty of misappropriating money that was intended for the construction of a prison in the city of Kisangani. The case and subsequent conviction are viewed as a significant development in the Congolese government's efforts to address and prosecute high-level corruption within the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs were imposed illegally. This ruling introduces the possibility that the U.S. government may have to refund billions of dollars in collected tariff revenue, a prospect that could strain the federal budget and require more debt issuance. In response to this potential fiscal pressure, the 30-year Treasury bond yield climbed past 4.97%, reflecting investor anxiety about the nation's financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The results of a new clinical trial suggest that azelastine, a common over-the-counter antihistamine nasal spray, may be effective in preventing COVID-19 infections. In the study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, participants who used the spray three times a day had a 2.2% infection rate, significantly lower than the 6.7% rate in the placebo group. Researchers theorize the spray might inhibit the virus's ability to replicate within the nasal passages, offering a potential new tool for prophylaxis against respiratory infections.</p>

This area had become a refuge for thousands fleeing the conflict, but recent heavy rains triggered the catastrophic event in the mountainous Jebel Marra region, compounding an already severe humanitarian crisis.</p>
