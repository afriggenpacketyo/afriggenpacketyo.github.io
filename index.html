        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major three-year study has clinically proven that specially designed group singing classes are highly effective in treating new mothers with postnatal depression. These unique sessions, which incorporate a mix of lullabies, folk, and gospel songs from various cultures, not only foster crucial social connections among participants but also significantly reduce stress. Researchers observed that the positive effects, including a decline in stress hormone levels, continued for six months beyond the program's conclusion. This successful initiative, Melodies for Mums, has expanded across the UK and is now being explored by the World Health Organization for international implementation, offering a promising and cost-effective alternative or complement to existing mental health support for new mothers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT will soon permit erotica for verified adult users, aiming to "treat adult users like adults" and expand content offerings. This move, similar to xAI's recent sexually explicit chatbots, seeks to attract more paying subscribers but intensifies calls for tighter AI regulation, particularly regarding age verification. The decision follows a wrongful death lawsuit against OpenAI, where parents criticized parental controls after their teen son's suicide, prompting the company to claim improved mitigation of mental health risks. Critics, including legal experts, express concern about the effectiveness of age-gating and potential harm to minors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly linked a $20 billion US financial lifeline to Argentina with the upcoming midterm elections, stating the US would not "waste our time" helping if libertarian leader Javier Milei's party loses. Welcoming Milei to the White House, Trump acknowledged the aid was an attempt to influence the vote, praising Milei's policies for leading to "prosperity." This explicit linkage is notable given Trump's past stance against foreign election interference, and comes as Milei faces declining poll numbers and corruption scandals. Financial markets reacted negatively, unconvinced that Trump's endorsement would stabilize Argentina's economy or boost Milei's electoral prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) criticized a "bizarre" anti-ICE protest in Portland, where hundreds of nude demonstrators staged a "die-in" and made obscene gestures outside an ICE facility. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated these "unsightly tactics won’t stop us or slow us down," affirming law enforcement's commitment to removing dangerous individuals. This incident is part of ongoing clashes in Portland, where federal officers have faced violent protesters, doxxing, and a significant increase in assaults. McLaughlin attributed the chaos to "Antifa domestic terrorists and anti-ICE rioters," asserting that "law and order will prevail" under President Trump.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Paralympic swimmer Jess Smith found that AI image generators initially struggled to accurately depict her missing arm, often creating a woman with two arms or a prosthetic. This highlighted inherent biases in AI, reflecting societal inequalities due to insufficient diverse data. However, upon a recent attempt, ChatGPT successfully generated an accurate image, marking a significant step forward for disability representation in technology.

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron concluded his seminal podcast, "WTF With Marc Maron," after a 16-year run and nearly 1,700 episodes, marking the end of an era for the influential interview format.

Maron, who evolved from a struggling comedian to a respected actor and interviewer, built a career on vulnerability, fostering deep, candid discussions with guests from comedy, music, and politics in his garage. While proud of the show's impact, Maron expressed a desire to reclaim personal time, reflecting on the medium's evolution and the rise of troubling content like the "manosphere."</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to President Trump's characterization of him as "not the easiest guy to deal with," stating he hopes the remark stems from his unwavering toughness on issues critical to Israel's future. Netanyahu emphasized his responsibility to protect the Jewish state, citing 3,500 years of persecution and his actions against Iran, including "historic action" to prevent atomic threats. Trump's full comment, however, concluded by praising Netanyahu as "great" for his steadfastness. This exchange highlights the complex dynamic between the two leaders and Netanyahu's commitment to Israel's security.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Hamas must disarm and demilitarize for the recently brokered peace deal in Gaza to progress peacefully, warning that President Trump's conditions are clear: "all hell breaks loose" if they do not. Following the return of living hostages, Netanyahu emphasized the necessity of preventing weapons manufacturing and smuggling in Gaza. Hamas has publicly rejected disarming, with Trump threatening to disarm them "quickly and perhaps violently" if necessary.

          <p>President Trump posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who died at 31. The ceremony, held on what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday, celebrated him as a "fearless warrior for liberty" and a leader who mobilized young Americans. Kirk's death has become a rallying cry for Republicans, who attribute political violence to "far left" groups, a claim echoed by Trump. Kirk, known for founding Turning Point USA and espousing socially conservative views, faced criticism for his rhetoric. His widow, Erika Kirk, accepted the award, pledging to continue his work as the new CEO of Turning Point.</p>

The anecdote serves as a backdrop to the current dynamic, where China, once a learner, is now a global EV leader, prompting the EU to consider "roadblocks" amid concerns about fair competition and market access. The article questions whether cooperation can still clear the way for future relations.</p>

          <p>Over 6,700 conservative Christian women gathered in Dallas for the "Share the Arrows" conference, a rallying cry for culture war battles reignited by the recent death of activist Charlie Kirk. Commentator Allie Beth Stuckey welcomed attendees to a fight for truth, faith, and the nation, framing Kirk as an evangelist turned martyr for conservative beliefs on Scripture, family, abortion, and gender. The event, which saw a surge in attendance post-Kirk's assassination, aimed to equip women for spiritual battles waged in homes and public squares. Speakers condemned progressive views, emphasized traditional roles, and discussed the possibility of a revival, with Stuckey lauded as a "female Charlie Kirk."</p>

          <p>Following the Gaza ceasefire, Israelis and Palestinians experience mixed emotions of joy and despair as living hostages were returned and Palestinian prisoners released. While aerial bombardments ceased, violence persists as Hamas forces reassert control in areas vacated by Israel, clashing with armed gangs and alleged collaborators. Reuters correspondent Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports hundreds of security forces deployed, leading to dozens of killings, as Hamas fights to regain governance. The peace deal's long-term success hinges on Hamas's disarmament and relinquishing power, a contentious issue. Gazan civilians, though joyful about the pause in fighting, face immense loss, uncertain reconstruction, and a yearning for lasting peace and time to grieve.</p>

          <p>NBA star Tyrese Haliburton, once a Milwaukee Brewers fan, is now actively rooting against them in the NLCS due to an alleged snub. Haliburton claims the Brewers canceled his ceremonial first pitch last summer after his Indiana Pacers eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks from the 2024 NBA playoffs. Since then, he has publicly worn jerseys of teams playing against the Brewers, including the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers. This personal anecdote highlights the intense loyalties and rivalries within professional sports.

          <p>New York prosecutors are seeking 90 days to decide on a third trial for Pedro Hernandez, convicted in the 1979 murder of six-year-old Etan Patz, after an appeals court ordered a new trial or his release. The appeals court cited issues with Hernandez's police interrogation, mental illness, and jury instructions in his 2017 conviction. Hernandez's lawyers are pushing for a quicker decision and his release, arguing an "innocent man is sitting in jail." Prosecutors maintain the conviction was just and plan to appeal to the US Supreme Court, noting challenges in retrying the decades-old case due to aging or deceased witnesses.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled in favor of a Michigan school district, upholding its decision to ban "Let's Go Brandon" shirts worn by two students. The mother argued her sons' First Amendment rights were violated, but the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stated that "vulgarity trumps politics" in schools, even when cloaked in euphemism. The school maintained it prohibited vulgar messages, not political ones, citing students wearing "Make America Great Again" apparel. A dissenting judge argued the phrase is political criticism without actual profanity. The ruling reinforces schools' authority to regulate speech deemed vulgar, even if politically motivated.</p>

          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is experiencing its lowest morale in decades following recent layoffs affecting 550 employees, reducing staff by over 10%. These cuts are part of a reorganization aimed at creating a leaner infrastructure and maintaining fiscal discipline, unrelated to the federal government shutdown. JPL has seen its workforce shrink by a third in two years due to massive federal budget cuts, particularly for its Mars Sample Return mission. Further uncertainty stems from proposed cuts to NASA's science mission directorate.

This new threat follows Argentina's visit to the White House, where the US pledged $20 billion in aid, and comes amidst Trump's recent volatile remarks about China, which have caused stock market fluctuations. The US is a major importer of China's used cooking oil, and Trump's post underscores escalating trade tensions and potential economic disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the fifth such strike by the Trump administration since September, with 27 reported deaths, though no evidence or identities have been provided. Lawyers question the legality of these actions under international law, and neighboring nations have condemned them. Trump justified the strike as self-defense, framing it as part of a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels. Critics suggest these strikes are a political campaign to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, despite Venezuela not being a primary drug trafficking hotspot.</p>
