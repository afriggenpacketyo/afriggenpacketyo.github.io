          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level since April 2023. This move coincides with the bank downgrading its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker public demand. While inflation has dropped substantially to 2.1%, nearing the target range, the central bank noted that ongoing global trade uncertainties, particularly with U.S. tariffs, pose a risk, although the immediate impact has been minimal. Analysts predict further rate cuts later in the year and into early 2026 to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polls in Israel indicate a significant shift in public opinion, with a growing majority—now at 74%—supporting a deal with Hamas to secure the release of all hostages, even if it means ending the war in Gaza. This change is driven by pressure from hostages' families who fear for their loved ones' safety. However, surveys also reveal a stark disconnect regarding Palestinian suffering, as 79% of Jewish Israelis report being untroubled by reports of famine and hardship in Gaza. This suggests that while the desire to bring hostages home is paramount, broader empathy for the Palestinian population has not increased.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of North Koreans are reportedly being sent to work in Russia under "slave-like" conditions to address a labor shortage exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. According to interviews with defectors and South Korean intelligence, these laborers face punishing 18-hour workdays on construction sites, are confined to their work areas, and live in abysmal conditions. Most of their earnings are confiscated by the North Korean state as "loyalty fees," with workers receiving their small remaining pay only upon returning home to prevent escape. This practice violates UN sanctions, with Russia allegedly using student visas to bypass the ban.</p>

          <p>Spain is creating friction with the Trump administration by pursuing an independent foreign and defense policy, which includes renouncing U.S. aircraft purchases and fostering closer economic ties with China. The Spanish government has resisted pressure to meet NATO's new 5% defense spending target and awarded a contract to Huawei, drawing criticism from both the U.S. and EU. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using these foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues. While President Trump has threatened trade repercussions, Spain's EU membership has so far shielded it from direct U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>A specific model of the NexGen knee implant, used in thousands of NHS surgeries, was known to have a high failure rate for eight years before it was finally withdrawn in 2022. Patients have reported severe pain, immobility, and addiction to painkillers after the implant, which lacked a key plastic component, slipped out of place. Concerns were first raised by the UK's National Joint Registry in 2014, yet the manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, allegedly delayed acknowledging the problem. The issue has resulted in hundreds of costly corrective surgeries, with the total bill for the NHS estimated to be in the millions of pounds.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the U.S. and China flared at a UN Security Council meeting regarding the Panama Canal. The U.S. expressed concerns that Beijing's growing influence over the canal's critical infrastructure and port operations could threaten global trade and security. China's ambassador firmly rejected these claims, accusing the U.S. of fabricating lies as a pretext to regain control over the strategic waterway. The exchange highlighted the geopolitical rivalry over the canal, which Panama's president stressed is neutral and under his country's sovereign control, following the transfer from the U.S. in 1999.</p>

          <p>In a trial challenging President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a commanding general testified that he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The lawsuit, filed by California's governor, questions the legality of using military forces for domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act. The Trump administration justified the deployment by invoking a law that permits military use during a "rebellion," but Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman's testimony contradicts this characterization. The trial is examining whether the military's role was limited to protecting federal property or if it illegally crossed into domestic law enforcement activities.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl was attacked and bitten by a mountain lion outside her family's home in Malibu on Sunday evening. The girl was doing chores in her backyard when the attack occurred; her mother and sibling rushed out after hearing screams, scaring the animal away. The girl was hospitalized with injuries to her arm, leg, and back. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located the mountain lion hiding in brush on the property and euthanized it. DNA samples will be used to confirm it was the same animal involved in the rare but serious incident.</p>

          <h2>Nepal Waives Climbing Fees for 97 Mountains to Boost Tourism in Remote Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 21:55:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to boost tourism in its less-developed western provinces, Nepal will waive climbing fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. This initiative aims to draw mountaineers to more remote areas as permit fees for Mount Everest are set to increase to $15,000. The 97 mountains, located in the Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces, have historically seen very little climbing activity. Officials hope the move will create jobs and strengthen local economies, while also potentially providing training grounds for climbers, as a new law may soon require an ascent of a 7,000m peak before attempting Everest.</p>

          <p>Two armed carjackers led authorities on a chaotic, two-hour pursuit from Lancaster to downtown Los Angeles, stealing three different vehicles before ultimately escaping. The chase began when the suspects stole a pickup truck, then abandoned it to carjack a big rig, which they drove the wrong way on the 10 Freeway. After ditching the semi-truck, they stole a third vehicle, a Chevrolet Silverado, before abandoning it under a freeway overpass and disappearing. A loaded firearm was recovered from the first stolen truck, and authorities believe additional suspects may have helped the two men escape.</p>

          <p>Newly released FBI documents contain allegations from a Democratic whistleblower who claims that Representative Adam Schiff, while on the House Intelligence Committee, approved the leaking of classified information to discredit then-President Donald Trump. The staffer, who reportedly worked for the committee for over a decade, described the alleged actions as "treasonous" and "illegal" in a 2017 report to the FBI. According to the documents, the whistleblower attended a meeting where Schiff allegedly stated the group would leak derogatory information to be used to indict President Trump. The documents were recently provided to Congress by FBI Director Kash Patel.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has taken control of the Washington D.C. police force and ordered the deployment of the National Guard into the capital, bypassing the city's elected officials. Trump justified the move as necessary to "rescue" the city from what he described as a wave of lawlessness, a portrayal that critics say is based on false and misleading claims. The president also warned that other Democrat-led cities could face similar federal intervention. D.C. officials have condemned the action as illegal, and protests have formed outside the White House in response to the unprecedented move.</p>

          <p>The city of Huntington Park, California, a predominantly Latino community, is experiencing widespread fear and economic disruption due to increased raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Residents and local officials report that the city's once-bustling commercial areas have become like a "ghost town" as people are afraid to go out. Some businesses are now locking their doors during operating hours to protect themselves and their customers. A city council member stated that the fear is impacting the local economy, which will likely see lower sales tax revenue, reducing funds for essential community services.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy already convicted of using excessive force. The judge called the government's attempt to overturn the jury's felony conviction "contrary to the public interest" and ordered the deputy, Trevor Kirk, to begin his four-month prison sentence. The case became controversial after the new U.S. Attorney offered a lenient post-conviction plea deal, which prompted the resignation of several prosecutors. The judge noted no new evidence was presented to justify erasing the conviction.</p>
