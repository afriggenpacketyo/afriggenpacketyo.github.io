        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £20.2 billion in September, marking the highest level for that month in five years and intensifying pressure on the Chancellor ahead of the upcoming Budget. A rise in debt interest payments offset increased tax income, pushing borrowing for the first six months of the financial year to £99.8 billion. With public sector debt now at 95.3% of GDP, levels unseen since the early 1960s, the figures highlight significant fiscal challenges. This article details the growing financial strain and the need for policy responses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun serving a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his 2007 election campaign with illicit money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. This marks the first time an ex-French leader since World War Two has been imprisoned, a significant moment for judicial accountability. Sarkozy, who maintains his innocence and appealed the term, is held in an isolation cell at La Santé prison. He expressed deep sorrow for a France he feels is humiliated by revenge, yet stated he would accept no special treatment. This article highlights a major event in French political history.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator has stated that the proposed acquisition of Core Scientific is a "nice to have" rather than a necessity, as significant shareholder opposition to the $9 billion all-stock deal mounts. A key proxy advisor recommended against the acquisition, suggesting Core Scientific's market valuation is higher than CoreWeave's offer. Intrator confirmed the company will not increase its bid, emphasizing the fairness of their current proposal while maintaining CoreWeave's aggressive acquisition strategy in the burgeoning AI sector.

          <p>The "winology" theory, conceptualized by Chinese academics, is gaining considerable traction across social media as it seeks to address perceived unfair Western dismissals of China's significant economic and technological advancements.
