        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced widespread policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. These actions aim to stimulate economic growth amidst trade tensions, with the central bank governor noting borrowing has been somewhat insensitive to interest rates. The policies also target support for key sectors like technology and real estate, including establishing a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. Analysts suggest these measures indicate urgency to bolster the economy, though new fiscal policies may be needed for concrete signs of economic deterioration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations, primarily due to an air traffic controller shortage exacerbated by recent equipment failures. The union representing air traffic controllers reported that several members are on trauma leave after an equipment malfunction caused a temporary loss of communication with pilots, lasting between 30 and 90 seconds. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has announced plans to overhaul the nation's aging air traffic control system. Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for an investigation into the situation, and United Airlines is offering free ticket changes for affected passengers.</p>

          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to begin talks this week in Switzerland to attempt to de-escalate the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Since President Donald Trump's return to the White House, new import taxes on Chinese goods have reached 145%, with Beijing retaliating with levies on some US goods of 125%. Experts anticipate that the negotiations will likely be lengthy and could take several months or even more than a year to reach a resolution.</p>

          <p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has expressed concern over reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting raids targeting businesses, particularly restaurants, in Washington, D.C. Activists warned of the planned enforcement, claiming ICE is using President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at the "beautification" of the U.S. capital as justification. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington has voiced deep concern, emphasizing the significant role of immigrants in the local restaurant workforce and the potential economic impact of these actions. The Metropolitan Police Department is not involved in these operations.</p>

          <p>New legislation in England and Wales proposes additional prison time for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. Under the Victims and Courts Bill, offenders could face up to two extra years in prison, and those already serving whole life orders could be confined to their cells and lose privileges. Families of sexual assault and murder victims, whose perpetrators did not attend sentencing, have advocated for the change, viewing it as a step in the right direction for justice. The Prime Minister has pledged to follow through on the legislation, which aims to ensure offenders cannot "opt out" of facing the consequences of their actions.</p>

          <p>India has announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against what it described as "terrorist infrastructure sites" in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. This action follows a deadly attack on tourists in the Kashmir region last month, which resulted in numerous fatalities. The Indian Defense Ministry stated that the strikes were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, targeting the roots of cross-border terror planning without targeting Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan has reported casualties and retaliatory actions, leading to calls for restraint from the United Nations and concerns from Japan about escalating military conflict.</p>

          <p>The United States and the Houthi rebels in Yemen have reportedly reached an agreement to halt American airstrikes after the Houthis agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea. President Trump announced the truce, stating that the Houthis "have capitulated," but the Houthis themselves have not declared a full cease-fire and assert they will continue to fight Israel. The US bombing campaign has cost over $1 billion, and it remains unclear whether the Houthis will stop attacking other vessels in the crucial shipping lane. The agreement comes as American officials are working to negotiate a deal to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.</p>

This growth is fueled by improved transportation infrastructure and a rising interest in cultural activities. While retail sales have remained tepid, the services sector, including tourism, is showing faster growth, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Miami Marlins in extra innings, with their bullpen fatigue becoming a costly problem. Tony Gonsolin delivered a solid start, and Shohei Ohtani had a strong performance, but the Dodgers' overworked bullpen struggled in the later innings. Journeyman reliever JP Feyereisen gave up the walk-off single to Jesús Sanchez in the 10th inning. Manager Dave Roberts was forced to use less appealing pitching options due to workload concerns, highlighting the strain on the Dodgers' bullpen.</p>
