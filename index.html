          <p>California Republicans are criticizing Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for their handling of riots that erupted in response to the Trump administration's immigration raids. Republicans claim Newsom and Bass are allowing Los Angeles to "burn" by supporting illegal immigrants and hindering federal law enforcement. The riots involved attacks on ICE officers and federal buildings, leading to multiple arrests and the deployment of the National Guard. The controversy underscores the deep political divisions over immigration enforcement in California, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of cruelty and Republicans demanding stricter adherence to federal law. Optimism about the situation remains low amidst ongoing tensions.</p>

Musk criticized a multitrillion-dollar spending package passed by the House, calling it a "disgusting abomination" that would increase federal deficits. Johnson downplayed Musk's criticisms, stating that the legislation was designed to help hardworking Americans, not please the world's wealthiest individual. The Speaker emphasized the importance of collaboration for the benefit of the country, despite the emotional nature of the situation.

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns about potential police budget cuts and urged the government to protect their funding.

Zelenskyy called for a ceasefire throughout the discussion, noting that Ukraine is ready to lay down its arms without conditions if Russia will, too. He also noted that he wants to believe that he and Trump have a "normal, equal professional relationship."</p>

The poll also indicates mixed views on the economic impact of the program, with more Americans thinking it will weaken the economy. While there is a gap between liking the goals and the approach, Trump's approval rating on immigration remains higher than on the economy and inflation.</p>
