          <p>Treasury yields increased as investors grew concerned that a new U.S. tax bill could worsen the country's deficit, especially after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating. Investors are closely watching discussions around President Trump's budget bill, as some Republicans may not support it without larger deductions for state and local taxes. According to Deutsche Bank analysts, the final agreement on the tax bill will significantly impact the size of the U.S. deficit in the coming years. Ray Dalio also warned that credit ratings might understate credit risks because they don't account for the government printing money to pay debts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced the "Protect Children's Innocence Act of 2025," which seeks to punish individuals who perform gender transition measures on minors.

          <p>Despite cultivating ties with right-wing populist leaders worldwide, President Trump's foreign policy decisions have often left his allies disappointed. Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu and India's Prime Minister Modi, who have both been compared to Trump, have experienced this firsthand. Trump's actions, such as negotiating with Hamas and criticizing Apple's move to India, demonstrate that political affinity does not guarantee special treatment. Even Hungary's Viktor Orbán, a staunch Trump supporter, has expressed frustration over Trump's pressure to decouple from China, highlighting the transactional nature of Trump's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to UK health officials. The fragments were found in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. The risk to the general public is considered very low, and there have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date. Experts recommend eliminating standing water sources and using mosquito repellent to mitigate the risk of mosquito bites.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax cut plans are amplifying concerns about debt and deficits among bond investors, influencing interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, and the 30-year yield has jumped above 5%, reflecting deficit worries. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic warned that volatility in the Treasury market could increase economic uncertainty. Investors are concerned that the administration's tax bill will add to the federal deficit, potentially leading to higher interest rates.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing public criticism for stating he had never purchased rice due to receiving it as gifts. The comment sparked outrage amid rising rice prices in Japan. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro as Eto's replacement. Japan has been grappling with soaring rice prices due to inclement weather and policies protecting local farmers, leading to voter discontent and low approval ratings for the government.</p>

          <p>The UK inflation rate has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest in more than a year, driven by increases in household bills, including water, gas, and electricity prices. The Office for National Statistics reported that housing and household services, transport, and recreation and culture were the largest upward contributors. The Bank of England had previously expected inflation to peak at 3.7% before dropping back to its 2% target, but the latest data casts doubt on further interest rate cuts this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed plan to cap drug prices through a "most favored nation" policy lacks a real enforcement mechanism and amounts to a request for pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily cut their profit margins. The executive order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify a price target and then asks the pharmaceutical industry to voluntarily charge that price. Experts suggest that the executive branch likely lacks the authority to impose such a policy without congressional legislation.</p>
