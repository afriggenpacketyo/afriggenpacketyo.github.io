          <p>This article clarifies rules regarding delaying Medicare enrollment and capital gains taxes on home sales. Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties unless you or a spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, allowing you to keep employer-provided health insurance. Delaying enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account. The article also distinguishes between the home sale exemption for primary residences and 1031 exchanges for investment properties, noting that they cannot be used simultaneously but can be used on the same property sequentially under specific conditions.

Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth accused China of seeking hegemonic power and military force to alter Asia's balance of power, referencing a 2027 deadline for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. China responded by accusing the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, citing U.S. military activities in the South China Sea.

Despite Israel easing an 11-week aid blockade, the UN says the amount of aid sent in the last week meets just over 10% of people's needs.

While some claim the review will be transformative, others suggest its impact may be marginal, with specific details about spending and procurement not expected until later in the year.

          <p>The biggest display of the northern lights since 2024 is expected to unfold at the end of the weekend due to a massive solar flare.

Viewing conditions may be impacted by clouds in some areas and smoke from Canadian wildfires in others. This natural phenomenon is anticipated to be spectacular.</p>

          <p>UK steelmakers have criticized US President Donald Trump's decision to double import taxes on steel and aluminum to 50%, calling it "yet another body blow" to the industry. Trade group UK Steel warns that some orders could be delayed or canceled, with uncertainty surrounding shipments already en route. The UK government has stated it is engaging with the US to provide clarity to the industry. The new tariff is set to come into effect on Wednesday, replacing the previous 25% import tax. The impact of the tariff increase is a cause for concern.</p>

This decision has drawn criticism from pediatricians and obstetricians, who maintain the vaccine's safety and importance.

Investigators are looking into whether the letter was an attempt to get the man deported, preventing him from testifying against his alleged attacker. The accusation led to his arrest and detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Local investigators found that the handwriting in the letter did not match the man's, and jailhouse calls revealed discussions about sending letters to ICE to frame him. The case is still under investigation.</p>
