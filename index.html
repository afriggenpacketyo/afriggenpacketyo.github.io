          <p>Adeline Ngan-Binh Bui, an employee at a North Austin mortuary, has been arrested and charged with abuse of a corpse and tampering with governmental records after allegedly experimenting on corpses, including injecting formaldehyde into severed limbs to observe decomposition. A former embalmer reported Bui for fraudulently obtaining death certificates under his name and license. Capital Mortuary Services has been issued a cease-and-desist letter and is now closed.

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine would not recognize Russian control of Crimea. Trump claimed that Zelenskyy's stance is harming peace negotiations and prolonging the conflict. This comes as the US administration, with Vice-President JD Vance laying out the vision, appears willing to accept a deal that would freeze territorial lines and potentially recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, a move contrary to international legal norms and Ukraine's constitution.</p>

          <p>Over six million illegal vaping products have been seized across England in the past three years as Trading Standards officers crack down on illicit trade. These vapes often contain excessive nicotine levels and fail to meet UK safety requirements, posing health risks to consumers. The crackdown precedes a ban on single-use disposable vapes, which are seen as a major driver of the illegal trade. Trading Standards officials have uncovered sophisticated networks involved in the distribution of these illicit products, which are often linked to other criminal activities.</p>

          <p>Foreigners who overstay their visas in Japan face the stigma of criminality, often treated like common criminals despite no other charges against them. In 2024, over 90% of foreigners deported for violating immigration law had overstayed their visas. While other countries are adopting more neutral terms like "undocumented immigrants," Japan has made little progress in revising its language. Some advocate for a more compassionate approach, recognizing that overstaying can be due to unavoidable circumstances.</p>

          <p>New York is leading a coalition of twelve states in a lawsuit aiming to block President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he lacks the authority to impose the levies without congressional approval. The lawsuit challenges Trump's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), claiming it does not grant him the power to impose tariffs. The White House has defended its actions, citing national emergencies related to illegal migration, fentanyl flows, and the trade deficit.</p>
