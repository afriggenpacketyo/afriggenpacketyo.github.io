          <p>Red Bull Racing is navigating a critical period of uncertainty following the departure of team principal Christian Horner, with star driver Max Verstappen's future at the team now a central question. While Horner's exit resolves some internal tensions, significant concerns remain over the car's declining competitiveness against rivals like McLaren and the development of Red Bull's new 2026 engine. The article analyzes the immense challenges facing new team boss Laurent Mekies, who must stabilize the team, stop a brain drain of key personnel, and convince Verstappen that Red Bull can return to its winning form.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, citing the ongoing criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as an unjust "Witch Hunt." This action is notable as the U.S. currently runs a trade surplus with Brazil, and the proposed rate is one of the steepest for any trading partner. The threat letter also criticized Brazil over digital trade policies and alleged attacks on free speech, prompting a sharp rebuke from Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who vowed to retaliate under his country's economic reciprocity laws.

          <p>The United States has recorded its highest number of measles cases in 33 years, with 1,288 infections confirmed so far in 2025, surpassing the total from the significant 2019 outbreak. The surge is largely driven by a major outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in the deaths of two children, with cases now reported in 38 states. Health experts attribute the rise to declining MMR vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity, making communities with low coverage particularly vulnerable to the highly contagious and potentially deadly virus.</p>

          <p>A 67-year-old man from Texas died while hiking on the South Kaibab Trail in Grand Canyon National Park during a period of extreme heat. The hiker was found unresponsive after reportedly turning back from an attempt to reach the Colorado River for an overnight stay. Although the official cause of death is pending, park officials issued a strong warning about the hazardous summer conditions, where temperatures on exposed trails can exceed 120°F. They strongly advise against hiking in the inner canyon during peak heat hours, as the extreme temperatures can dangerously compound physical stress.</p>

          <p>Kathmandu, Nepal, is experiencing a dramatic surge in electric vehicle adoption, with the number of EVs growing from just 250 in 2020 to over 13,000 in 2024. This rapid shift is driven by favorable government policies, including lower taxes on EVs compared to gasoline cars, and a strong public desire to combat the capital's severe air pollution. With ambitious national targets to electrify most new vehicles by 2030, Nepal is leveraging its abundant hydropower resources to power a transition towards more sustainable urban mobility.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a colossal and innovative sound system from the early 1970s designed to provide perfect audio clarity to every member of the audience. Conceived by sound engineer Owsley Stanley, the system was a utopian effort to create an egalitarian concert experience but proved to be a logistical and financial nightmare. The immense weight, complexity, and frequent technical glitches of the rig ultimately contributed to the band's burnout and a temporary hiatus, marking a fascinating chapter in the intersection of music, technology, and hubris.</p>

          <p>This article presents a timeline of pivotal moments that have defined the trajectory of homelessness in Los Angeles over the past several decades. It highlights the devastating impact of the 1980s crack cocaine epidemic, which, combined with harsh sentencing laws, pushed many, particularly from the Black community, into long-term destitution. The timeline also covers key legal battles, such as the 2012 Lavan v.

Key factors identified in the article include the racially motivated halt of public housing construction in the 1950s, the demolition of thousands of single-room occupancy hotels, the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs, and the subsequent explosion in housing prices. This deep dive demonstrates that the core of the problem has consistently been a severe scarcity of affordable homes.</p>
