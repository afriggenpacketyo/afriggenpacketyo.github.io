          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with over 600 cases reported across 21 states, marking the highest number since 2019. A major outbreak in West Texas has led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children, contributing to the nationwide surge. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to declining vaccination rates, with data showing a decrease in measles vaccination among kindergarteners. The CDC emphasizes the importance of vaccination to achieve community immunity and prevent severe complications, including hospitalization, brain damage, and death. The current outbreak highlights the continued threat of preventable diseases due to vaccine hesitancy.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline, falling below $80,000, as global markets reacted negatively to President Trump's newly imposed tariffs. Investors, rattled by fears of a potential global recession, began selling off their crypto holdings, triggering a wave of liquidations. The cryptocurrency market is currently testing critical support levels, with analysts suggesting further declines are possible if market turmoil persists. Some experts, however, believe that in the long term, Bitcoin could benefit from deglobalization and geopolitical tensions as a decentralized reserve asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block a lower court order mandating the return of a man deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that the Maryland judge lacked the authority to issue such an order and that the U.S. cannot compel El Salvador to comply. The case involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported due to an "administrative error," according to the government, although they also allege he is a member of the MS-13 gang. The legal battle highlights the ongoing tensions between the administration's immigration policies and judicial oversight.</p>

Critics argue that this gimmick hides the true cost of the cuts, which will add trillions to the national debt.

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is considering adding to its positions in Goldman Sachs and Eli Lilly amid market volatility. Goldman Sachs was downgraded due to its exposure to investment banking revenues, but Jim Cramer believes it can still make money in a volatile environment. Eli Lilly is facing headwinds due to the Trump Administration's decision to decline coverage of obesity drugs through Medicare, but Cramer is tempted to buy more shares pending results from an upcoming obesity pill trial.

          <h2>Potential Stagflation Crisis Looms Amid Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 12:51:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy faces the risk of stagflation due to President Trump's tariff policies, which could lead to stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment. Tariffs function as taxes on imported goods, potentially increasing inflation and slowing growth. While economists disagree on the severity, the tariffs are expected to cause higher inflation and slower growth. The potential for retaliatory actions from trade partners further complicates the situation, making the consequences of Trump's policies difficult to predict.</p>
