          <p>Former Secretary of State John Kerry stated that Democrats, including President Biden, failed to adequately address immigration, allowing a "siege" at the US-Mexico border. In a BBC interview, Kerry acknowledged that Donald Trump was right about the need for a protected border, a stance he believes all public officials should have taken. His comments highlight a significant internal debate within the Democratic Party over its immigration policies and their political impact. These remarks come as the Trump administration implements aggressive deportation efforts, which are being legally challenged by several cities and states.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and strong macroeconomic fundamentals like low inflation and large foreign reserves. The official noted the yuan's stability during recent global stress events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and US tariff shocks. This perspective contributes to the ongoing discussion about the internationalization of the yuan, especially as confidence in the US dollar is tested by debt risks and protectionist policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have created the world's lightest brain controller, designed for insects like bees. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses needles to deliver electronic pulses to its brain, effectively creating illusions to command its flight. The research team, led by Professor Zhao Jieliang, reported a high success rate, with the "cyborg" bees obeying flight commands such as turning, advancing, and retreating nine out of ten times. This breakthrough represents a significant step in the field of bio-robotics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially announced that a 50% tariff on copper imports will be implemented on August 1, following a national security assessment. He justified the move by highlighting copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies. The announcement caused a significant surge in US copper prices, creating a wide premium over global prices. While the administration aims to reshore copper production, experts caution that building domestic capacity will take years, potentially leading to short-term shortages and price hikes for consumers.

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, a United Nations special rapporteur responsible for investigating human rights abuses in the Palestinian territories. This action follows Albanese's vocal criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza, which she has described as "genocide," and her support for ICC arrest warrants against Israeli officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the move was a response to her "political and economic warfare," while human rights groups condemned it as an attempt to silence a UN expert. The sanctions are the latest in a series of administration actions to counter criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.</p>

The report reveals that these nations are signing contracts worth millions, sometimes bartering natural resources, to secure influence and potential support from the US administration.

          <p>Shares in WK Kellogg, the North American cereal maker, surged over 56% following reports that it is in advanced takeover talks with Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. The deal, potentially valued around $3 billion, could be announced this week and would give the owner of Nutella and TicTac a dominant position in the US breakfast cereal market. WK Kellogg, which produces brands like Fruit Loops and Rice Krispies, was split from its international parent company in 2023 and has been facing financial struggles. The potential acquisition reflects ongoing consolidation in the food industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is proposing to bar foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits as part of a plan for stricter welfare curbs. In an upcoming speech, she will frame Britain's rising benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" that threatens the economy. This move aims to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour government, which recently scaled back its own planned welfare cuts after a backbench rebellion. The Conservative proposals also include tightening eligibility for mental health conditions to address rising welfare spending.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent government measures designed to cool down Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. Despite a quarterly economic contraction, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. Analysts expect the bank may consider rate cuts later in the year once new mortgage restrictions show a stabilizing effect on the property market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a steep 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, set to begin next month, explicitly linking the trade penalty to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter, Trump called the criminal case against his political ally an "international disgrace" and a "Witch Hunt" that must end. The move is unusual as the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil. Brazilian President Lula da Silva responded that his country is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will react by invoking its economic reciprocity laws.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxfam highlights staggering wealth inequality in Africa, revealing that the continent's four wealthiest individuals hold more wealth than the poorest 50% of its population, or about 750 million people. The combined wealth of Africa's 23 billionaires has soared by 56% in the last five years to $112.6 billion. Oxfam argues that government policies are biased against the poor, failing to leverage progressive taxation to redistribute wealth. The organization contends that this extreme inequality hinders democracy, impedes poverty reduction, and exacerbates the climate crisis across the continent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans that were sickened by a toxic algal bloom have been successfully treated and released back into the wild in Huntington Beach. This year's bloom was the most severe in Southern California since 2015, poisoning hundreds of seabirds and sea lions with domoic acid. The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center treated nearly 200 birds during the event. The public release of the recovered pelicans serves as a positive symbol of resilience and the importance of wildlife rehabilitation efforts in the face of environmental threats.</p>

          <p>Recent major floods in New Mexico and Texas produced starkly different outcomes, illustrating the critical role of preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where recent wildfires increased flood risk, the community was ready for the expected deluge, resulting in three fatalities but a swift return to relative normalcy. In contrast, a flood in Texas just days earlier caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 119 deaths. Experts note that a community's recent experience with a specific disaster heavily informs its response, making the fire-scarred Ruidoso more alert to the subsequent flood threat.</p>

While a 60-day truce might be possible within weeks, the official stated that a long-term settlement is "questionable" and contingent on the complete removal of Hamas. The official reiterated Israel's war aims of returning hostages and eliminating Hamas, stating that those who do not disarm will be killed. These comments temper hopes for a lasting peace deal and highlight the vast differences between the Israeli and Hamas positions on the future of Gaza.</p>

The decision comes weeks after the president withdrew the nomination of entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who was linked to Elon Musk. Trump explained he pulled the nomination after learning Isaacman was a "blue blooded Democrat" and felt it was inappropriate for a close associate of Musk, whose company SpaceX is a major NASA contractor, to lead the agency. Duffy takes over NASA at a critical time for its lunar and Martian exploration programs.</p>

The president stated that Ukraine must be able to defend itself from being "hit very hard" and that too many people are dying. This reversal comes amid Trump's expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's attacks on Ukrainian cities. The initial pause was part of a broader review of weapons transfers, but the decision-making process appears to have been disjointed within the administration.</p>
