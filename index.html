          <p>A boat collided with a 20-foot minke whale near New Jersey's Barnegat Bay, an incident which proved fatal for the marine mammal. Video of the event showed a passenger being thrown overboard from the vessel, though officials reported the individual is believed to be unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center was alerted to the whale's presence shortly before the collision was reported. The whale was later found deceased in shallow water, with a necropsy planned to investigate the incident further.</p>

He finished the race in the same position, while his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured pole and finished fourth. Despite his personal struggles and frustration, Hamilton acknowledged that the team's car is showing progress and expressed his commitment to returning for the next race. Team principal Frederic Vasseur and former boss Toto Wolff both voiced support for Hamilton, attributing his mood to his high standards and expressing confidence in his ability to rebound.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats reportedly engaged in intense negotiations to secure the release of several billion dollars in government funds in exchange for confirming a number of President Trump's nominees before the August recess. Sources indicate that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought funding for entities like the National Institutes of Health and the World Food Program. The deal ultimately fell through when President Trump rejected the terms, leading to public recriminations between the two leaders. This political standoff means that about 140 of Trump's nominees must wait until at least September for their confirmation votes.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" held the number one spot at the North American box office for a second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this figure represents a significant 66% drop from its impressive debut, a steeper decline than other recent superhero films. The animated sequel "The Bad Guys 2" opened in second place with $22.2 million, while the comedy reboot "The Naked Gun" took third with $17 million. Analysts noted the slow start to August's box office but expressed hope that upcoming releases could help the summer season reach its $4 billion target.</p>

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' series-clinching victory over Australia, Ireland centre Bundee Aki shared a remarkable personal story. He revealed that his wife, Kayla, had given birth to their fifth child in the back of a car while on her way to the hospital in New Zealand. The birth of their daughter, Aine, occurred just before the first Test match of the series, and Aki had not yet met his newborn. The 35-year-old player praised his wife's strength and shared the humorous details of learning about the birth via video call while in a pre-match team meeting.</p>

          <p>Smoke from hundreds of wildfires raging across Canada is causing hazy skies and poor air quality in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. States including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York have issued air quality alerts, advising residents to limit outdoor activities due to pollution. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, and wind patterns are transporting the smoke southward. Health officials warn that the fine particulate matter can cause irritation for healthy individuals and more serious health effects for sensitive groups, including worsening of heart or lung disease.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions broadly unlawful, did allow for claims where commissions were unfairly large. The FCA will now consult on a formal redress scheme, expected to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with the first payouts anticipated next year. The scheme is intended to cover agreements dating back to 2007. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, led prayers at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, an act that has drawn international condemnation and escalated regional tensions. The site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the home of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, is a frequent flashpoint for violence. Under a long-standing agreement, Jews are permitted to visit but not pray there. Ben-Gvir's provocative act, during which he also called for conquering Gaza, was seen as a defiance of this status quo, despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's insistence that it remains unchanged.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano, located on Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over three miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a major earthquake in the region. Russian authorities stated that the ash was spreading eastward over the Pacific Ocean and that no populated areas were in its path. While there was a brief tsunami warning, it was later lifted. There is some discrepancy among scientific bodies as to when the volcano's last confirmed eruption occurred.</p>
