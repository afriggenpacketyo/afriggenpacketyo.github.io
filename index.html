          <p>Bobby Hart, the acclaimed songwriter responsible for co-creating many iconic hits for The Monkees, including "Last Train to Clarksville" and "I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone," has passed away at the age of 86. His collaborative partnership with Tommy Boyce was pivotal in shaping the band's distinctive sound and penning their memorable theme song, alongside six tracks on their debut album. Beyond his work with The Monkees, Hart pursued his own musical career and engaged in political activism, notably campaigning for Robert F. Kennedy and supporting the 26th Amendment.

          <p>A significant portion of car owners are currently "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle's market value, a trend that has reached a four-year high in the second quarter of 2025. This situation, impacting 26.6% of trade-ins, compels drivers to either cover the negative equity with cash or incorporate it into a new loan, thereby escalating their total debt. The article highlights that longer loan terms and minimal down payments contribute to this problem. Financial experts recommend thorough research, securing pre-approval for various auto loans, and considering guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance to mitigate risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands protested in Ankara against a judicial crackdown targeting Turkey's main opposition, the Republican People's Party (CHP), ahead of a court ruling that could remove its leader, Ozgur Ozel. Ozel condemned the upcoming hearing as a "judicial coup" by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, asserting it aims to undermine democracy and obstruct justice. Protesters, waving Turkish flags and party banners, chanted for Erdogan's resignation, signaling deep public discontent over the politically charged allegations of vote-rigging in a 2023 CHP congress. This article underscores the significant political tension and the opposition's resistance to perceived government oppression.</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a world-first single-dose vaccine designed to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease that is a leading cause of death and significantly impacts their populations. Developed over a decade by researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the vaccine aims to reduce infection rates, prevent the progression to clinical disease, and in some cases, even reverse existing symptoms without requiring a booster. Chlamydia can cause blindness, infertility, and severe bladder damage in koalas, often leading to starvation or euthanasia.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are navigating a crucial final two weeks of the regular season, with their playoff seeding and the highly desired first-round bye hanging in the balance. Although a playoff berth is almost certain, the team currently possesses the third-best record among division champions, which would necessitate playing in a wild-card series rather than advancing directly to the division series. Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers’ president of baseball operations, stresses the strategic advantage of the bye for player recovery and optimal rotation alignment, despite the team's historical challenges after receiving one.

          <p>American farmers are experiencing significant economic hardship, largely attributed to trade tensions with China and the repercussions of President Trump's tariffs, which have led to a sharp decrease in international crop orders. Despite a rise in farm bankruptcies and escalating operational costs, many rural Americans, a crucial voting demographic, maintain their support for Trump, holding onto the belief that his policies will eventually yield positive long-term outcomes. The article delves into this complex loyalty, observing that while some farmers voice concerns, others remain patient, framing current difficulties as an inevitable "adjustment period." This situation underscores the profound political polarization and nuanced attribution of blame within rural communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by symptoms like difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience often associated with busy lifestyles and elevated stress levels. Although not a medical condition in itself, it frequently indicates mental fatigue or an overstretched cognitive state. Medical experts emphasize the importance of acknowledging brain fog as temporary and integrating deliberate mental breaks into daily routines. Scheduling short "firebreaks" between activities, even just 5-10 minutes for stretching or stepping outdoors, can significantly aid the brain in resetting and processing information. This article provides practical, actionable strategies to enhance mental clarity and alleviate cognitive fogginess.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United's Struggles Attributed to Player Selection, Not System, Says Danny Murphy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's recurring problems originate from player selection and misplacement within their 3-4-2-1 system, rather than the formation itself. While acknowledging improvements in team compactness and defensive shape, Murphy highlights that individual errors, such as Bruno Fernandes's defensive lapses when deployed in a deeper central midfield role, are consistently costing the team valuable points. The article argues that despite Fernandes's technical prowess, his natural instincts are not suited for the defensive responsibilities of that position. This analysis underscores the manager's crucial task of optimizing player roles within the tactical framework, suggesting that personnel issues are more critical than the system itself.</p>

          <p>Desmond Holly, the 16-year-old perpetrator of a shooting at Evergreen High School, was active on a "violent gore" website known for hosting white supremacist content and graphic violence months prior to the attack, an ADL report states. Holly, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot after injuring two students, was reportedly "radicalized by an extremist network." The article notes that several other school shooters in the past year also frequented this same site, which features real images of extreme violence. This alarming connection underscores significant concerns about online radicalization and the urgent need for enhanced violence prevention and social-emotional learning programs to counter such influences.</p>

          <p>China's Victory Day parade, featuring President Xi Jinping alongside Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, was strategically orchestrated to convey a potent geopolitical message, particularly to nations in the Global South. The display aimed to reassure domestic audiences of China's resilience against Western pressure and to demonstrate that credible alternatives to Western partnerships are available. For middle powers seeking to develop military capabilities while navigating an interconnected world without Cold War entanglements, this article suggests the parade signaled that alignment with Beijing offers diplomatic legitimacy without requiring Western-imposed reforms. It projected an image of an "axis of the excluded" rather than an "axis of evil."</p>

Zheng underscores the critical importance of China embracing its unique secular civilization to effectively establish its appropriate role within the international order.

A subsequent search warrant executed at their residence uncovered additional explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction.
