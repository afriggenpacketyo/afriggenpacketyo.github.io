          <p>Construction has commenced on a new ballroom at the White House, involving the demolition of a portion of the East Wing. President Trump announced the project, which he stated is fully funded by private contributions from businesses and tech companies, costing taxpayers nothing. The new addition is planned to be over 90,000 square feet, capable of holding nearly 1,000 guests for major events and state visits. Despite initial claims that it wouldn't interfere with the existing structure, video and reports confirm demolition is underway on the wing that houses the first lady's offices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major heist at the Louvre museum, the French Ministry of Culture has confirmed the stolen crown jewels were not covered by private insurance. According to French law, national museum collections are considered state property and are self-insured by the state unless they are being loaned to another institution. As a result, neither the museum nor the government will receive an insurance payout for the estimated $102 million loss. Experts express doubt that the priceless historical artifacts will be recovered, as the gems are likely to be broken up and sold on the black market.</p>

          <p>Nebraska's Republican Senator Deb Fischer has publicly warned the Trump administration against its proposal to import beef from Argentina, arguing it would harm American cattle ranchers. President Trump suggested the plan as a way to lower soaring beef prices in the U.S., which would also serve as financial aid to Argentina's struggling economy. However, Fischer and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association contend that government intervention in the market will undermine domestic producers without effectively reducing consumer costs. The proposal comes as part of broader U.S. financial support for Argentina, a move that has already drawn criticism from other agricultural sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Christopher Moynihan was taken into custody by New York State Police for making a terroristic threat. Jeffries released a statement thanking law enforcement and highlighting that the individual was released from prison due to the presidential pardon. This incident has reignited debates surrounding the blanket pardons issued to those convicted of Jan. 6-related offenses.</p>

          <p>In response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri is organizing a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing to investigate what he describes as a rise in left-wing political violence. The hearing, titled "Politically Violent Attacks: A Threat to Our Constitutional Order," is scheduled for October 28th and aims to examine the intersection of free speech and violent extremism. Schmitt argues that such violence is predominantly from one side of the political spectrum and threatens constitutional rights. Conservative commentator Michael Knowles is currently the only confirmed witness for the event.</p>

In a series of posts on X, Musk insulted Duffy's intelligence and background, escalating a conflict over the timeline and management of America's space exploration goals.

With the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) already facing scrutiny over its data collection methods and recent staffing cuts, there are worries that the shutdown could lead to an incomplete or adjusted inflation reading. Despite these doubts, economists expect the report to show an annual inflation rate of around 3.1%, in line with previous months. This CPI release is particularly significant as it is one of the few economic data points being published during the shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

This departure follows two other resignations and adds to frustrations over delays in appointing a chairperson and accusations that the inquiry's scope is being diluted.

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat soared dramatically, jumping over 90% on Tuesday after a 127% surge the previous day. The rally was triggered after the stock was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of the company's float had been sold short. The surge marks a stunning reversal for the former penny stock, which had fallen more than 67% just last week. The company also announced an expanded distribution deal with Walmart, further fueling the buying frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors saw its stock price climb more than 15% after the automaker announced strong third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and raised its financial guidance for 2025. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, beating analyst forecasts. GM increased its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $12 billion and $13 billion, signaling confidence despite challenges in its EV division and a profit margin decline in its core North American business. The positive outlook was also bolstered by a reduced expected impact from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight traveling from Omaha to Los Angeles was diverted and returned to its origin airport shortly after takeoff due to a misunderstanding caused by a faulty internal communication system.

It was later determined that the knocking was from the flight attendants who were also trying to contact the pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration and airport officials confirmed there was no security threat, and the incident was resolved safely upon landing.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors suggest investors can adjust their portfolios to capitalize on the changing economic environment. Unlike previous aggressive rate-slashing periods, the current cuts are happening amid a relatively strong economy, creating a unique situation. Advisors recommend strategies such as locking in yields on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds and maintaining a well-diversified equity portfolio rather than chasing specific sectors like small caps. The key is to balance capturing higher yields now with managing risk in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly disputed claims from David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, that the AI startup is "woke" and pursuing a "regulatory capture strategy." Sacks had criticized Anthropic for fear-mongering and pushing for state-level AI regulations that could stifle the startup ecosystem. In response, Amodei stated that his company's policy goals are aligned with the administration's desire to ensure AI benefits Americans and that a uniform federal approach is preferable to a patchwork of state laws. The exchange highlights the political and ideological debates shaping the future of AI regulation in the United States.</p>

          <p>An analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, with businesses passing a significant portion of the costs onto consumers. The research found that product categories like furniture, car parts, and electronics have seen notable price increases. According to the study, tariffs added 0.5 percentage points to the headline inflation rate between June and August. While companies are still experimenting with pricing, other analyses suggest that consumers could ultimately bear over half of the total cost of the levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary from filmmaker Raoul Peck, titled "Orwell: 2+2=5," examines the legacy of George Orwell and his seminal novel, 1984. The film argues that while generations have recognized the book's prescient warnings about authoritarianism and propaganda, this recognition has often led to complacency rather than action. Using archival footage and Orwell's own writings, Peck traces how tactics like controlling language and suppressing truth have been employed by various regimes. The documentary suggests that simply acknowledging that reality can be "Orwellian" is not enough to prevent the erosion of truth and freedom.</p>

CCTV footage showed that a staff member recorded seeing her in a corridor when she was already in the toilet where the incident occurred. The coroner described the care as a "shambles" and said the trust "failed her that day," prompting calls for a broader inquiry.</p>
