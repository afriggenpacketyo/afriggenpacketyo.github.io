          <p>The US House of Representatives passed several bills aimed at countering China's economic espionage, export control violations, national security threats, and alleged human rights abuses, while also seeking to strengthen ties with Taiwan and protect Falun Gong practitioners. These bills, which had previously stalled in the Senate, gained bipartisan support amid rising US-China tensions over trade tariffs and technological competition. One key bill, reintroduced by Representative Rich McCormick, authorizes the president to impose sanctions on foreign entities involved in trade secret thefts or aiding adversarial militaries, specifically targeting Chinese firms transferring sensitive technologies to countries like Russia. The article highlights the increasing legislative pressure on Beijing from the US.</p>

          <p>In China, a growing circular economy is emerging around the recycling of lithium-ion batteries and solar panels, driven by the increasing volume of these products reaching the end of their life cycle. Companies like Henan Hairui Intelligent Technology are focusing on recycling valuable components such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from these discarded items. This trend is particularly significant as it improves China's mineral independence amid global trade tensions. The sales manager at Henan Hairui Intelligent Technology noted that 70% of the company's business is dedicated to machines for recycling batteries and solar panels.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, where hundreds of flights have been delayed or canceled. Schumer attributes the problems to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, outdated technology, and depleted federal funds. He criticizes the FAA's handling of the situation, including a bonus offered to air traffic controllers at other towers but not to those in Washington, Philadelphia, or New York, where the need is greatest. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark to mitigate the disruptions, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area."</p>

          <p>Dustin McCurry and Kayly Allman were arrested in North Carolina after deputies discovered a large quantity of fentanyl during a traffic stop.

Allman was found with drug paraphernalia and methamphetamine. Both individuals were out on pretrial release at the time of the incident and were not issued a bond pending judicial review. The sheriff's office emphasized the severe threat fentanyl poses to public safety and the need for vigilance in addressing illegal drug activity.</p>

          <p>Social Security cards will soon be available digitally, raising both optimism and concerns among experts. While digital access offers convenience, there are worries about access for older or less tech-savvy individuals, as well as the security of Social Security numbers and the devices on which they are accessed. Experts emphasize the need for robust ID theft protections, given that many Social Security numbers have already been compromised in data breaches. The move is seen as a step in the right direction if implemented securely.</p>

          <p>Medicare does not cover several important healthcare costs in 2025, including dental care, routine vision exams, hearing aids, overseas medical care, and long-term custodial care. These exclusions can leave seniors exposed to major, unexpected expenses, potentially eroding their retirement savings. Supplemental coverage like Medigap is increasingly popular to help cover costs Medicare doesn't fully cover, such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Purchasing supplemental coverage early is advised, as healthcare costs continue to rise and eligibility can depend on one's health.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to incentivize prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S., aiming to streamline the path for pharmaceutical companies to build new production sites stateside.

This move comes ahead of Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. Some pharmaceutical companies are starting to push back on Trump's plans, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla saying the tariff threat is deterring further U.S. investments in research and development.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Seeks Dismissal of Lawsuit Aiming to Restrict Access to Abortion Pill</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit that seeks to sharply restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, taking the same position as the Biden administration in a closely watched case. The Justice Department's filing asserts that the case does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the federal district court in which it was filed. The plaintiffs are the conservative attorneys general of three states, and the case was filed in a federal district court in Texas.</p>

          <p>The article argues that President Donald Trump is using his lawyers as a shield to avoid answering difficult questions and taking responsibility for his actions. It highlights instances where Trump deferred to his attorneys on matters of constitutional law and executive power. The author suggests that Trump's supposed deference is a tactic to grab power while avoiding accountability, contrasting his actions with his past behavior of demanding loyalty and disregarding legal norms.</p>

The cuts aim to remove "redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership by reducing excess general and flag officer positions."

          <p>President Donald Trump's surprise announcement that he wants to reopen and expand the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay is drawing new attention to the infamous prison. Alcatraz closed as a federal prison 60 years ago, housing some of America's most infamous criminals. The prison's mystique has attracted Hollywood, but the facility maintained a surprisingly small population. The prison's isolation in San Francisco Bay contributed to its mystique, particularly regarding escape attempts.</p>

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is facing scrutiny for allegedly using a practice known as "red-boxing" to coordinate political strategy and spending with a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. Cuomo appears to have posted strategic information on his campaign website, which could be used by Fix the City, a super PAC created to raise and spend huge sums on his behalf. New York City has rules that prohibit candidates from coordinating with super PACs. If found to have violated the rules, Cuomo could face penalties and lose out on public matching funds.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the constitutional requirement of "due process of law" for non-citizens in the U.S., in light of President Trump's mass deportation efforts. Legal experts say the type of "notice" and "hearing" afforded depends on an immigrant's status and circumstance. While the Constitution mandates due process, it does not necessarily guarantee a "trial" for every migrant detained. The Supreme Court has ruled that anyone detained under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 must be given a chance to seek habeas relief.</p>

          <p>A controversy in Malaysia involving the publication of the country’s flag missing its yellow crescent in a local Chinese-language newspaper during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s trip to Kuala Lumpur highlights how AI can inflame deep social divisions. The crescent symbolizes Islam, which Malaysia’s constitution recognizes as “the religion of the federation”. Yellow, the colour of royalty in Malaysia, symbolises the country’s system of constitutional monarchy which establishes the Malay rulers as the head of Islam. The incident sparked a backlash in Malaysia's increasingly polarized society, with some perceiving an insidious signalling of loyalties by a Chinese vernacular outlet to the visiting Chinese head of state.</p>
