          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's distinctive approach to international trade, characterized by last-minute announcements and shifting deadlines. This strategy, likened to a "reality show," aims to pressure trading partners into making concessions, as seen with the USMCA and a recent deal with the U.K. While these tactics have produced some results by the administration's standards, they also inject significant volatility into global markets, forcing businesses and foreign governments to constantly adapt to an unpredictable policy environment. The article questions the long-term stability of a global economy where a major player frequently changes the rules with little notice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new, higher tariffs on goods from more than 60 trading partners, set to take effect in seven days. The executive order details a tiered system, with rates ranging up to 41% for Syria, based on whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with the nation. Canada faces a steep 35% tariff hike, prompting a disappointed response from its Prime Minister, while Mexico has received a 90-day extension. This move finalizes a process that began in April, aiming to reshape U.S. trade relationships and reduce trade deficits, despite criticism about its economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

The perpetrator of the 2024 attack was executed earlier this year. The Japanese embassy in China has been contacted for comment regarding this latest incident of violence against its citizens. </p>

          <p>Russia launched a record-breaking 6,443 drones and missiles into Ukraine during July, marking the highest monthly total since the full-scale invasion began. These relentless attacks, primarily using Iranian-designed Shahed drones, have led to a significant increase in civilian casualties and force Ukrainians into nightly shelter routines. Despite Ukraine's high interception rates, the sheer volume and evolving complexity of the Russian barrages pose a severe challenge to its air defenses. Analysts warn that Russia's drone production capabilities are expanding, suggesting these intense aerial assaults will likely continue and potentially escalate further.</p>

          <p>Nations across the globe are responding to the White House's latest list of revised tariff rates, which will take effect next week. Several Asian countries, including Cambodia and Thailand, expressed relief after their proposed rates were significantly reduced, while Taiwan continues to negotiate for a lower permanent tariff. In contrast, countries like New Zealand and Switzerland expressed disappointment over increased duties. Canada's Prime Minister criticized the new 35% tariff, vowing to protect Canadian jobs, while major partners like India, facing a 25% rate, continue to pursue broader trade agreements with the United States.

          <p>The death toll from a recent large-scale Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has climbed to 31, with over 150 people injured. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared a day of mourning and reiterated his call for increased international pressure and sanctions against Moscow. The attack occurred despite a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump, who had given Russia an August 8 deadline to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions. Russian officials claimed to have targeted military infrastructure, but Ukrainian authorities reported damage to civilian sites, including schools and hospitals across the city.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has deployed over 7,000 military and security personnel to popular tourist areas like Cancún and the Riviera Maya to combat escalating cartel-related crime. This initiative, named "Operation Summer Vacation 2025," aims to protect the millions of tourists expected during the season with land, air, and sea patrols. While intended to provide security, some experts suggest the heavy military presence may serve as a stark reminder of the underlying dangers. The U.S. State Department maintains a Level 2 travel advisory for the region, urging travelers to exercise increased caution due to risks of both property and violent crime.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, potentially altering the landscape of professional boxing. The legislation, backed by TKO Holdings Group, proposes alternatives to traditional sanctioning bodies, which could enable the company's new Saudi-funded venture, Zuffa Boxing, to operate with greater autonomy. Critics argue this move guts key protections of the original Ali Act, allowing a single promoter to control rankings and titles, similar to the UFC's controversial business model. This development is seen as a strategic move by Saudi Arabia to consolidate its growing influence over the sport.</p>

Quarterly revenue hit 572.3 billion yen, a 132% increase year-over-year and well above analyst expectations.

While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration, many ventures now frame moon missions as a "stepping stone" for future human expeditions to the red planet. The new space race to Mars involves a broader set of players, including China and the European Space Agency, alongside the U.S. The article notes that as national agencies pivot towards Mars, lunar projects may increasingly become the domain of private companies, which are already playing a key role in delivering payloads to the Moon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation has uncovered a widespread black market of unlicensed and dangerously overcrowded shared houses, known as HMOs, in London. Tenants in these properties face unsanitary conditions, including rats, mould, and overcrowding that has, in some cases, proven fatal. Evidence from several London boroughs suggests the number of illegal HMOs may far exceed licensed ones, with many advertised openly as "bedspaces" in shared rooms. Despite efforts by local councils to crack down on rogue landlords, enforcement appears to be overstretched, leaving many vulnerable renters, including families with children, in precarious and unsafe living situations.</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Brian Cox is returning to the Scottish stage in "Make it Happen," a new play about the historic collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The production is a highlight of the Edinburgh International Festival, which is beginning alongside the Edinburgh Fringe, transforming the city into a global arts hub. Cox, known for his role in "Succession," plays the ghost of economist Adam Smith, arguing that his philosophies have been misinterpreted. At 79, Cox states his focus is on protest and advocating for social equity, drawing from his own tough upbringing in Dundee.</p>

          <p>The legislative body of El Salvador has approved constitutional reforms that remove term limits and allow for indefinite presidential reelection. The changes, passed with overwhelming support from President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party, also extend the presidential term from five to six years. This move solidifies Bukele's power, following a controversial 2024 reelection that was enabled by a Supreme Court ruling. Opposition lawmakers condemned the reforms as the death of democracy in the country, arguing the proposal was rushed through while the public was distracted by summer holidays.</p>

          <p>Florida emergency officials have released a heavily redacted hurricane evacuation plan for the controversial Alligator Alcatraz detention center, sparking demands for greater transparency from lawmakers and advocates. The 33-page draft document, which outlines protocols for relocating detainees during a storm, has key sections blacked out, including the list of alternate facilities. Critics, such as Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, argue that the blacked-out information is unacceptable and that a clear, confirmed plan is needed. State officials have asserted that the facility is built to withstand a Category 2 hurricane, but would require evacuation for stronger storms.</p>

The author reflects on the disparity between her generation's work ethic and their lack of financial stability compared to their parents, particularly for those in creative, freelance fields. The article argues that systemic issues, such as the gender pay gap and the undervaluing of female labor, contribute to this precarity, leaving many feeling that a wealthy partner is the only viable safety net. It critiques an educational system that failed to provide financial literacy, leaving a generation to improvise.</p>

The two nations also pledged to expand joint military training programs, which have been ongoing since 2019. This deepening relationship comes as Beijing continues to increase its engagement and influence in the Gulf region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a foundational explanation of tariffs and their role in President Trump's international trade policy. It defines tariffs as taxes on imported goods, designed to make foreign products more expensive and encourage the purchase of domestic goods. The piece outlines the rationale behind the administration's strategy, which is to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, boost American manufacturing, and gain leverage in negotiations. It also touches upon the various types of tariffs Trump has implemented, from those on specific goods like steel to broad, country-specific duties, and the resulting economic volatility and criticism.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $200 million in federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The move, affecting grants from the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health, cites the university's alleged failure to maintain a research environment free of antisemitism and claims of discrimination. This action represents a significant escalation, marking the first large-scale, targeted funding withdrawal against UCLA. In a letter to the community, UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk called the penalty deeply disappointing and stated that defunding life-saving research does nothing to address the underlying allegations of discrimination.</p>
