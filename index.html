          <p>Starbucks is initiating a $1 billion overhaul that involves closing underperforming stores in North America and laying off 900 non-retail employees. The plan, detailed by CEO Brian Niccol, is part of a "Back to Starbucks" strategy to revitalize the brand amidst slowing sales and increased competition from rivals. While the exact number of closures was not specified, the company's North American store count is expected to decline by about 1% in the next fiscal year. The costs are primarily associated with breaking leases and providing severance for the affected workers (not investment advice).</p>

To make room for the new content, the publisher removed sparse biographical and geographical sections, acknowledging that users now turn to the internet for such information.

          <p>Following the Trump administration's reduction of federal oversight, the effort to protect Americans from overwhelming medical debt has shifted to state-level legislation. While several states, including Maine, have successfully passed bipartisan measures to bar medical debt from credit reports, similar bills have failed in more conservative states due to industry opposition. Advocacy groups are pushing for these protections as millions face the risk of losing insurance coverage. The mixed results highlight a persistent challenge in creating a unified approach to mitigating the financial impact of healthcare costs on consumers.</p>

The suspected shooter fired from a nearby rooftop before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is investigating the incident as an "act of targeted violence," noting that rounds found near the shooter contained anti-ICE messages. Following the attack, the acting ICE director placed all agency facilities on higher alert, as politicians from both parties condemned the politically motivated violence.</p>

          <p>Music producer Sean "Diddy" Combs, convicted in July on prostitution-related charges, is scheduled for a court hearing that could influence the length of his prison sentence. Combs has been detained in New York for nearly 13 months and will be sentenced on October 3. His lawyers are arguing for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which could lead to his immediate release, while prosecutors are expected to recommend a significantly longer term. The judge has previously denied bail, citing Combs' history of violence, suggesting a substantial prison sentence is likely.</p>

          <p>The Keeneland September Yearling Sale, a major thoroughbred auction, achieved a record $531.7 million in sales, a significant increase attributed to tax incentives from the Trump administration. A key factor is the renewal of "bonus depreciation," which allows buyers to write off 100% of a racehorse's purchase price in the first year. This tax advantage has spurred investment in the highly speculative market, with 56 yearlings selling for over $1 million each. While breeders celebrate the boom, some experts caution that many buyers may ultimately face financial losses on their high-priced investments (not investment advice).</p>

While polls show voters care about corruption in general, the constant stream of scandals without consequences has led to a sense of powerlessness and resignation among opponents, allowing Trump to weather controversies that would have ended other political careers.</p>

          <p>This analysis examines the challenges UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces in countering the populist rise of Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage. With Labour lagging in the polls, the party is looking to international counterparts for effective strategies, such as the Australian Labour Party's approach to tightening immigration rules while making a case for skilled labor. The article notes a tension within Labour on whether to dismiss Reform's policies as gimmicks or treat them as a serious threat. Strategists suggest the party must address core voter concerns about the economy and immigration to regain trust.</p>

          <p>Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico is confronting widespread domestic and international challenges, including large-scale protests in Bratislava against his government's policies. Demonstrators are rallying against a new austerity package that raises taxes and cuts public sector jobs and social benefits, which critics argue will harm ordinary citizens. Internationally, Fico faces criticism for his friendly relations with Russia and China, which has led to his party's likely exclusion from the Party of European Socialists. Despite the pressure, Fico's coalition government appears stable for now, as partners are wary of triggering new elections.</p>

The driver, Gary Poland, testified that he heard what he believed were gunshots and saw children fleeing in panic but drove away in fear and did not call the police for 50 minutes. He expressed deep regret for his delayed response, stating that he thinks about it every day and acted out of shock and panic.

          <p>Decades after France conducted 193 nuclear tests in French Polynesia between 1966 and 1996, the region's inhabitants continue to suffer from the long-term consequences. Activists and local politicians report disproportionately high rates of cancer and birth defects, which they attribute to radioactive contamination of their land and water. Despite President Macron acknowledging France's responsibility in 2021, the government has never formally apologized. Victims face significant hurdles in receiving compensation, as they must prove a direct link between their illness and the tests, a nearly impossible task for many.</p>

          <p>As American farmers begin their harvest, China's Ministry of Commerce has publicly called on the United States to cancel "unreasonable tariffs" to create better conditions for bilateral trade. The statement comes as China, traditionally the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, has yet to make its typical bulk purchases for the season. The ongoing trade tensions and tariffs have severely impacted a critical export for America's agricultural industry. Chinese officials emphasized that removing the tariffs would inject stability into the global economy and normalize trading relations for this vital crop.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to support suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a major cyber-attack forced the carmaker to suspend production at its UK factories. The shutdown, which will last until at least October, has raised fears that smaller firms in JLR's supply chain could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a scheme where the government would purchase component parts to maintain cash flow for the suppliers. The situation is unprecedented, as it would be the first time a company has received such support as a direct result of a cyber-attack.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are warning that the Trump administration's proposed budget, which would cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by 53%, poses a severe threat to the nation's health. The cuts would eliminate 61 programs focused on chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes, HIV/AIDS prevention, and emergency preparedness, while also laying off 16% of the agency's staff. Health officials argue that gutting the CDC's preventative programs will lead to more chronic illness, higher healthcare costs, and a reduced ability to respond to both domestic and global health threats.</p>

          <p>Patricia Lockwood's latest novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," offers a mind-opening exploration of living with long COVID. The book follows a writer, closely resembling Lockwood herself, as she navigates the persistent and disorienting effects of the illness, including memory loss, fever, and cognitive changes. The review highlights Lockwood's poetic prose and her ability to capture the alienating yet sometimes strangely interesting experience of chronic illness. The narrative avoids a simple resolution, instead dwelling in the complex, ongoing reality of a life and mind fundamentally altered by sickness.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute between the United States and Norway appears to be settling, according to Norway's foreign minister. The disagreement arose after Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund divested from U.S. company Caterpillar, citing the use of its equipment by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank. The U.S. State Department had expressed it was "very troubled" by the decision, and some Republican lawmakers suggested retaliation. The Norwegian government has since clarified that the divestment was an independent decision made by the central bank's board based on ethical guidelines, not a government policy.</p>
