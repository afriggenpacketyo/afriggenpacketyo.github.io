          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung are scheduled to meet on Tuesday during the Group of Seven summit in Canada, marking their first face-to-face encounter since Lee's recent appointment. The leaders previously discussed the importance of stable bilateral relations in a phone call, highlighting improvements in ties following historical tensions related to Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. This year commemorates the 60th anniversary of normalizing diplomatic relations between the two nations, and the summit presents an opportunity to further strengthen their partnership. Both leaders are attending the G7 summit, providing a platform for this significant bilateral discussion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have surged this year, outperforming traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, driven by concerns over fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference noted gold's appeal lies in its independence from government liabilities, unlike sovereign bonds and currencies tied to specific economies. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced sell-offs due to policy volatility and credit rating downgrades, leading investors to seek alternative safe havens. Gold's status as a large, liquid, and apolitical asset further bolsters its attractiveness amid growing global instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration's directives to cancel research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), particularly those related to LGBTQ+ issues and DEI initiatives, were unlawful. The judge, William Young, stated that the cancellations violated federal law by discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community. The ruling orders the NIH to restore the terminated grants, which some estimates suggest totaled up to $1.8 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has expressed disagreement with the ruling, asserting that the grants prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor, and is considering legal options. </p>

          <p>A Chinese team of scientists has achieved a data transmission speed of 1Gbps from a satellite in stationary orbit using a 2-watt laser, surpassing the capabilities of Starlink. Led by Wu Jian and Liu Chao, the team employed a combination of adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR) to overcome atmospheric turbulence, which typically scatters light and weakens signals. This AO-MDR synergy represents a significant advancement in satellite laser downlink technology, enabling high-speed data transfer from a distance of 36,000 kilometers. The technology could potentially allow for beaming an HD movie from Shanghai to Los Angeles in under five seconds.</p>

This decision comes as Japan's economy faces growth uncertainty and inflation remains above the BOJ's target, partly due to a rice shortage.

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) will issue up to $500 million in bonds to cover past alleged sexual misconduct claims, which have totaled $302 million in the current fiscal year alone. The bonds will stretch repayments over 15 years, mitigating the impact on the district's annual budget and educational programs. The move is in response to Assembly Bill 218, which opened a window for adults to file lawsuits over childhood sexual assault, leading to approximately 370 claims against LAUSD since January 2020. The district has also established its own insurance company to manage future abuse claims.</p>

          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, has reported to a U.S. federal prison after being sentenced for stealing nearly $17 million from the baseball player. Mizuhara, 40, will serve a prison term of four years and nine months in a low-security facility in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. He misappropriated $16.59 million from one of Ohtani's bank accounts to cover gambling debts and also stole funds for personal expenses, including baseball cards and dental work. Mizuhara is likely to be deported to Japan after completing his sentence, as he is not an American citizen.</p>

Read's first trial ended in a hung jury, and deliberations in this trial have been ongoing, with legal experts noting that the length of deliberations could indicate the jury's difficulty in reaching a consensus. The case has drawn significant attention, with comparisons being made to other high-profile murder trials, such as those of O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony, Scott Peterson, and Alex Murdaugh. The defense wants the verdict slip simplified as jurors deliberate the murder charge.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer is set to announce new sanctions targeting Russia at the G7 summit, aiming to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin and demonstrate the international community's commitment to peace. The measures are designed to restrict Putin's war machine and squeeze Russia's energy revenues, reducing the funds available for its war efforts. The announcement comes as Russia continues to carry out strikes against Ukraine, with Ukrainian officials reporting multiple casualties in Kyiv. While other G7 partners are expected to join the move, the US may not participate, as President Trump has signaled his opposition to further sanctions.</p>

          <p>China has hinted that its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned, with state media referring to an "era" of three carriers for the Chinese navy. New satellite images reveal 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, indicating a higher capacity than China's existing carriers. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggests the new markings indicate preparations for commissioning and trial service. Further sea trials and coordination exercises are expected before the Fujian formally enters service, potentially by the end of the year.</p>
