          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers requested the delay, citing conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be deported again upon release, which would interfere with his criminal trial. Abrego Garcia was previously granted legal status protecting him from removal due to likely persecution in El Salvador, making his initial deportation an acknowledged administrative error. He will now remain in federal custody until at least mid-July pending further hearings on the matter.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of a major domestic policy bill supported by President Trump, suggesting he may fund primary challenges against Republicans who vote for it. Musk condemned the legislation for its high spending levels and a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, calling it an "abomination." He also criticized the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits, which he argued would destroy American jobs. This stance marks a significant rift between the billionaire and his former ally, President Trump, as the bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," moves through the Senate.

          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official government data that showed a contraction for the third straight month. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which focuses on smaller, export-oriented firms, rose to 50.4, beating expectations. This divergence is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. While the official PMI surveys a larger sample of companies, the Caixin survey suggests some resilience in the export sector, though analysts note this momentum may taper off.

          <p>A North Carolina family is expressing deep concern over proposed cuts to Medicaid in President Trump's domestic spending bill, fearing it could force them to ration treatments for their 6-year-old daughter. The child, Kennedy Beaver, has Noonan syndrome and relies on a state Medicaid waiver program that covers over $4,000 a month in essential medical costs. State officials warn that the proposed federal funding cuts would likely impact this program, which supports children with significant medical needs. The family's situation highlights the personal stakes for many who depend on these services as lawmakers debate the legislation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers and its ownership's investment firm, Guggenheim Partners, are facing a federal civil rights complaint alleging unlawful discrimination through their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Filed by the conservative legal group America First Legal, the lawsuit claims that programs geared toward women and people of color violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by creating employment preferences based on race and sex. The complaint points to the team's Business Resource Groups and DEI mission statement as evidence of discriminatory practices. This legal challenge comes amid a national rollback of DEI initiatives mandated by the Trump administration.</p>

Dozens of Labour MPs have expressed opposition, raising concerns about tightening eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip).

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound called betaine, which is produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise and appears to slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It functions by inhibiting a specific enzyme associated with aging. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and could lead to new strategies that simulate these positive effects.</p>

          <p>China's booming coffee culture is spreading beyond its major cities and into the countryside, leading to a surge in new rural cafes. This trend is driven by a growing domestic coffee market, now valued at over $42 billion, and a desire among consumers for unique, scenic experiences perfect for social media. However, some question the sustainability of this craze, as many cafes rely on novelty and an "influencer-driven vibe" to attract customers. While tea remains a traditional staple, China's coffee consumption continues to grow rapidly, reflecting a significant shift in consumer tastes.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect who ambushed firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, killing two and critically injuring a third.

The deceased were identified as veteran firefighters Frank Harwood and John Morrison. The suspect, who was found dead at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot, had reportedly once aspired to be a firefighter, but his exact motive for the attack remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a comprehensive review of parental leave and pay, aiming to modernize a system that campaigners say has been neglected for years. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave policies, which have been criticized as flawed and among the worst in the developed world. Issues to be addressed include low take-up of shared parental leave and the fact that many fathers cannot afford to take paternity leave. The goal is to create a system that better supports working families, though any changes will likely require significant investment.</p>

This article follows two transgender officers, one in the Army and one in the Navy, as they navigate the personal and professional turmoil caused by the ban.

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is causing significant concern among various groups of Americans who could be directly affected by its provisions. The legislation proposes major cuts to social programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially leaving millions without health insurance or food aid.

He argues these investors are less concerned with traditional metrics and Federal Reserve moves, and more interested in the growth stories of companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and Palantir. This shift has created an "idea market" where individual company narratives and potential for disruption are valued highly. According to Cramer, these investors punish companies that prioritize stock buybacks over innovation, viewing it as a sign of stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

Parents face difficulties booking appointments, getting time off work, and accessing clear information about which vaccines are needed and when. This has led to no childhood vaccine in the UK meeting the 95% coverage target, resulting in outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles. The report calls for better support systems, such as improved NHS booking apps and expanded vaccination services, to help families protect their children.</p>
