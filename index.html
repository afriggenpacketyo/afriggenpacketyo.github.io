          <p>Renowned historian Rana Mitter asserts that World War II was a pivotal, yet often underestimated, factor in shaping modern China. He explains that the war devastated the country's infrastructure, forcing a near-total restart after 1945. Mitter, an expert on US-Asia relations and modern Chinese politics, argues that understanding this historical context is crucial for comprehending China's contemporary motivations. He concludes that China's primary strategic interest today is maintaining peace and stability throughout the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Firefighters were dispatched to combat a significant gorse fire on Arthur's Seat, a prominent hill in central Edinburgh. The blaze spread rapidly, causing large plumes of smoke to billow over the city during the busy festival season. Authorities closed off a large section of Holyrood Park and urged the public to avoid the area, though no casualties were reported.

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has overturned a Trump administration directive that had allowed commercial fishing within the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument. The ruling reinstates protections established under the Obama administration, immediately halting fishing in the federally protected area. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, represented by Earthjustice, filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration bypassed the required public comment process. The monument is a vital sanctuary for deep-sea coral reefs, endangered species, and holds significant cultural value for Indigenous Pacific Islanders.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire burning on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius has forced Italian authorities to close all hiking trails to the popular tourist destination. Firefighting efforts, involving ground crews and Canadair planes, are focused on three fronts, primarily on the densely vegetated Mount Somma side of the volcano. The blaze has consumed over 1,200 acres within the national park, and an investigation into its origin has been opened. The incident highlights Europe's increasing vulnerability to wildfires amid intensifying summer heatwaves linked to climate change.</p>

          <p>Talk-show host Piers Morgan clarified his previous statement calling Jake Paul's boxing career "staged bulls---" after facing legal threats from Paul's team. Morgan explained on social media that he meant Paul's opponents were often past their prime, not that the fights were illegally predetermined. Paul's camp, including co-founder Nakisa Bidarian and attorney Alex Spiro, had warned of legal action for defamation against anyone claiming the fights were rigged. Morgan deleted his original post but maintained his new statement was a clarification, not a retraction.</p>

          <p>In a series of social media posts, President Trump demanded the immediate removal of homeless individuals from Washington D.C., suggesting they be relocated far from the capital. The posts included photos of encampments apparently taken from his motorcade route. This comes as Trump threatens to federalize law enforcement in the city, despite official data showing that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating the city is not experiencing a crime spike and that local police are effectively reducing crime rates.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has escalated his conflict with Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, threatening that the fight "could literally last years." Abbott stated he will call continuous 30-day special legislative sessions and have the absent Democrats arrested upon their return to Texas. The dispute centers on a gerrymandering plan, reportedly pushed by Donald Trump, aimed at giving Republicans five additional U.S. House seats. Democratic governors from New York and Illinois have vowed to support the Texas Democrats and fight back against the move.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended his government's decision to suspend exports of certain arms to Israel that could be used in a Gaza offensive. While reaffirming Germany's solidarity with Israel, Merz stated that his government cannot supply weapons for a conflict that could kill thousands of civilians. The policy shift comes after Israel announced plans to take over Gaza City and has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative bloc. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Merz had "buckled" under pressure and hoped the decision would be reversed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing intense scrutiny over its accelerated approval pathway for drugs targeting rare diseases. The issue is highlighted by the case of Sarepta Therapeutics, whose gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy received a fast-tracked approval in 2023 despite limited clinical data. However, after three patient deaths from liver failure, the FDA has asked the company to suspend distribution of the $3.2 million treatment. This incident underscores the significant dilemmas and risks the agency navigates when balancing patient needs with safety concerns.</p>

While expressing willingness to work with the president on shared priorities, she asserted that the conditions required by law for a federal takeover of the police do not exist.

Speaking on Sunday, Rutte lauded Trump's strategy, saying he "broke the deadlock" by opening dialogue with Putin and praised the administration's pressure tactics. Rutte emphasized that while the Alaska summit is an important first step, any final peace deal or discussion of territory must ultimately involve Ukraine.

          <p>Apple's significant stock rally last week, which saw a 13% advance, was largely the result of a massive short squeeze. Before the rally, many short-sellers had targeted Apple, betting on its decline due to a perceived lack of an AI strategy and the threat of new tariffs on its products. However, when President Trump publicly praised Apple's U.S. investment commitments and effectively exempted it from tariffs, the stock surged, forcing short-sellers to buy back shares and further fueling the rally. This dazzling run obscured negative trends in the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

The severe weather, which affected several Midwest states, also led to widespread power outages, numerous water rescues, and road closures in the Milwaukee area.

          <p>Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has publicly criticized President Trump for reportedly considering the reclassification of marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. In a social media post, Kirk expressed his hope that the policy change does not happen, complaining that "everything already smells like weed" and arguing for the protection of public spaces. The potential move would reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, easing federal restrictions and opening doors for medical research. Social media users quickly pointed out a 2018 post where Kirk had argued against imprisoning people for marijuana-related offenses.</p>
