          <p>Ozeki Onosato secured the Emperor's Cup with a 14-1 record at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, despite losing his final match to yokozuna Hoshoryu. The 24-year-old wrestler, who had already clinched consecutive championships and promotion to yokozuna, aimed to be the first to achieve an undefeated grand tournament since 2021. Hoshoryu, however, disrupted Onosato's perfect run with a skillful overarm throw, preventing the perfect victory. Onosato expressed happiness with his overall performance and vowed to work harder for a flawless win next time, while the Japan Sumo Association is expected to formally recommend his promotion to yokozuna.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of women in their 20s and 30s are seeking "baby Botox" injections, smaller doses intended to prevent aging, raising concerns among doctors. Dr. Michelle Hure, a dermatologist, attributes this trend to increased online presence and the influence of TikTok filters, leading to heightened self-scrutiny and dissatisfaction with natural appearances. She highlights the psychological risks of cosmetic procedures, including dependence and perception drift, where individuals pursue incremental tweaks until they appear unnatural. Dr. Hure emphasizes the ethical responsibility of medical professionals to discourage unnecessary procedures and prioritize patient well-being over financial incentives, cautioning against the normalization of injections in non-medical settings like department stores.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments for pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap, presenting a challenge to Labour's policy stance. The party plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. This announcement intensifies the political debate, particularly for Labour, which faces internal divisions over these policies. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized both Reform UK and Labour, deeming their promises unaffordable and accusing them of making insincere pledges to gain public favor, while Labour has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments without specifying the details.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, launching a large number of missiles and drones in a single night, resulting in casualties and widespread damage. Ukrainian officials reported at least 12 deaths, including three children, and dozens of injuries, marking the second large-scale assault in 48 hours. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as a deliberate act of cruelty against civilians, urging allies to increase pressure on Moscow and impose further sanctions. The Ukrainian Air Force reported intercepting a significant portion of the incoming missiles and drones, but numerous regions were affected, with damage to residential buildings and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has not confirmed whether the government plans to abolish the two-child benefit cap, despite reports suggesting that Prime Minister Starmer had privately supported such a move. Rayner highlighted the establishment of a Child Poverty Taskforce to review the policy, but refrained from speculating on future government actions. The two-child benefit cap prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for additional children born after April 2017. Nigel Farage has stated that Reform UK would scrap the cap if they were to form the next government.</p>

          <p>A proposed tax bill in the House of Representatives could severely undermine the clean energy sector in the United States by terminating key tax credits that have fueled its growth. The bill targets investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities, potentially reversing the economic boom spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act. Industry leaders warn of significant job losses and increased electricity costs if the bill becomes law, while some Republican senators have expressed reservations about its impact. The legislation would also restrict projects sourcing materials from foreign entities, primarily China, potentially halting clean energy projects as early as next year. (not investment advice)</p>

Harvard argues that the policy would affect thousands of visa holders and violates constitutional rights. The Department of Homeland Security has moved to terminate Harvard's visa program, alleging the university failed to provide extensive behavioral records of student visa holders, while the administration has already frozen billions in federal funding to the university over alleged campus antisemitism.</p>

Testimony from medical examiners and forensic scientists has been scrutinized, with the defense raising questions about potential missteps in the police investigation and the possibility of a confrontation inside the house before the victim's death.

          <p>The U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles is intensifying immigration enforcement in jails to circumvent California's sanctuary rules, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The "Operation Guardian Angel" pilot program targets jailed individuals with criminal records who have been deported and reentered the country illegally, charging them with federal crimes. This tactic aims to focus federal resources on county jails and state prisons, where sanctuary rules have impeded immigration agents. While state officials maintain they already cooperate with federal authorities regarding immigrants who have committed crimes, the Trump administration views California's policies as hindering their mass deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>A recent surge of executive orders and congressional actions has placed the nation's public lands at risk, prompting a debate over their future management. The federal government manages these resources as a "commons" for all Americans, but proposals to transfer public lands into private hands raise concerns about ecological consequences. Historically, privatization has led to environmental damage, prompting the establishment of federal management to protect ecosystems. Designations on public lands do not seize private property but change management practices, often prioritizing multiple use and allowing for activities like camping, hunting, and fishing.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's cybercrime law, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), has drawn criticism from human rights groups for allegedly silencing dissent, particularly among journalists. The law criminalizes the dissemination of false information online that could incite fear or unrest, leading to arrests and legal challenges for journalists. Press freedom groups express concern that the government did not consult them before enacting the strict laws, while the government claims the law is necessary to limit disinformation. Critics argue that the law is used to control criticism of the state and suppress independent journalism.</p>

The vote is the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which President Maduro claimed to have won despite credible evidence of fraud. The opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado, urges voters to boycott, calling the elections a "parody" to legitimize Maduro's rule.

Critics argue that the president has dismantled accountability measures and installed loyalists in key positions, making it difficult to hold him accountable.

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the Black Lives Matter movement has faced a significant backlash, with a shift towards the politics of "white grievance." Despite initial widespread support, public opinion has waned, and policies aimed at addressing racial inequality are being dismantled. President Trump has championed policies that critics say undermine diversity, equity, and inclusion, while some individuals who gained prominence during the movement have faced scrutiny and criticism. While some acknowledge the setbacks, they maintain that the struggle for racial justice is ongoing and that change is never fully rolled back.</p>
