          <p>Jeffrey Wood, a Canadian man, has been sentenced to nearly two years in prison for stealing a famous photograph of Winston Churchill, known as "The Roaring Lion," from Ottawa's ChÃ¢teau Laurier hotel. The original print, taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, was replaced with a forgery, and Wood admitted to both the theft and the forgery. Justice Robert Wadden emphasized the breach of trust in stealing such a culturally significant item, while Wood's lawyer considered the sentence unnecessarily harsh for a first-time offender.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in northern Arkansas for Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault, after he escaped from a high-security prison. Hardin, 56, was discovered missing during a routine inmate count, having donned a makeshift law enforcement uniform to facilitate his escape. Law enforcement officials consider him extremely dangerous and are urging residents not to approach him if sighted.

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, a move that could affect future team valuations. The bill would limit the deduction of intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, to half their value over 15 years, potentially raising nearly $1 billion over a decade. While not impacting current owners, the change aims to cool the frenzy among wealthy buyers and address fairness concerns for fans facing rising ticket prices.

          <p>Small-scale distillers in Japan are fueling a domestic gin boom by using homegrown ingredients and local specialties to create craft gins. The popularity of gin is rising in Japan, with domestic shipments increasing significantly since 2019. Distillers are experimenting with local ingredients like juniper berries, bitter gourd, and camellia flowers. The ability to convert existing whiskey and shochu distillation equipment for gin production, along with the quick monetization from production to sales, is driving this trend.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. While Japan's gross external assets rose to a record high, partly due to a weaker yen, they were still below Germany's total. Japan's net external credit increased for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States. The U.S. continues to have a net external liability, meaning its foreign debts exceed its overseas assets (not investment advice).</p>
