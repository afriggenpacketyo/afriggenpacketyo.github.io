          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, is calling for police to publicly release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. This demand follows the arrest of two men in connection with an alleged sexual assault of a young girl in Warwickshire. Farage argues that transparency would prevent harmful online speculation, referencing unrest following a previous attack where false rumors spread. The call has been echoed by a local Reform UK council leader, while police maintain they follow national guidelines that do not include sharing such details.</p>

          <p>A political standoff is escalating in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic state lawmakers from office if they do not return for a special legislative session. The Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a controversial new congressional map. This proposed map, backed by Donald Trump, could create up to five new Republican-leaning districts, potentially securing the party's control of the U.S. House. The Democrats are holding events in other states to draw national attention to the issue.</p>

          <p>The recent death of actress Loni Anderson has brought renewed attention to her high-profile and turbulent romance with the late Burt Reynolds. Anderson, known for her role in "WKRP in Cincinnati" and as a prominent sex symbol, had a marriage with Reynolds that was marked by public disputes and accusations after their divorce in 1995. Despite the acrimony, which included allegations of infidelity and abuse, the couple reportedly made peace before Reynolds' death in 2018. They were brought together by their shared son, Quinton, for whom they maintained contact over the years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is planning a pilot program that could require travelers from certain countries to post a bond of up to $15,000 to obtain a business or tourism visa. The program targets countries with high rates of visitors overstaying their visas or where security vetting information is considered lacking. This initiative is a response to a presidential executive order aimed at curbing illegal immigration and enhancing national security. Critics argue the measure will deter tourism and negatively impact the U.S. economy, particularly the travel and hospitality industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Business leader Moni Mannings has been appointed to chair a new diversity and outreach committee for the UK's honours system. The move by the Cabinet Office aims to make the process more inclusive and ensure recognition reaches a wider range of communities and backgrounds. This follows analysis showing that higher awards disproportionately go to individuals in London and the South East, with few recipients from northern England or working-class backgrounds.

          <p>A major wildfire, named the Gifford fire, has prompted evacuation orders in central California after scorching over 65,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest. The blaze threatens more than 450 structures, and several injuries have been reported, including one resident with burns. With only 3% containment, officials are concerned that hot, dry weather and erratic winds could fuel rapid fire growth. Over 1,000 firefighters are currently battling the flames, which originated from several smaller fires along State Route 166. The cause remains under investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democrats to block a redistricting vote highlights a high-stakes political tactic known as "breaking quorum." This strategy, used by minority parties to halt legislative action, has a mixed history of success in states like Oregon, Indiana, and Texas itself. While walkouts can effectively delay legislation and draw national attention to an issue, they rarely block a bill's passage permanently if the governor can repeatedly call special sessions. The tactic underscores increasing political polarization, turning legislative disputes into tests of endurance with potential personal and financial consequences for the lawmakers involved.</p>

This article reviews his statements, showing he tends to praise the monthly figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics when they are strong and beneficial to his political standing. Conversely, he often alleges the numbers are manipulated or fraudulent when they appear weak or could benefit his political opponents. This history provides context for his recent firing of the agency's commissioner after a report showed weaker-than-expected job growth and significant downward revisions for previous months.</p>

However, the justices have now requested new briefings on whether the Act's requirements are unconstitutional, signaling a potential reversal. This move could overrule the landmark Thornburg v.

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report, which showed a meager gain of 73,000 nonfarm payrolls and significant downward revisions for prior months, confirms that the economy is slowing considerably.

While second-quarter GDP growth appeared strong, underlying data points to weaker consumer spending and business investment.

          <p>Corporate insiders at several major companies, including United Airlines, Charles Schwab, and NXP Semiconductors, have recently made significant stock sales. United's CFO sold shares totaling $2.1 million, while NXP's CFO sold shares worth $1.54 million, reducing their respective holdings considerably. Such transactions are monitored by investors for potential insights into a company's health, though the motivations for executive sales can vary widely. The data, which focuses on discretionary sales rather than pre-planned transactions, shows a pattern of selling by multiple executives at some of these firms over the past month.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has intensified the political conflict over redistricting by threatening to press bribery charges against the Democratic lawmakers who fled the state. The Democrats left to prevent a vote on a Republican-backed plan to redraw congressional maps, a move that would likely increase the GOP's majority in the U.S. House. Abbott alleges that if the lawmakers solicited or accepted money to fund their walkout, it could constitute a second-degree felony for bribery. This new threat comes after the state's Attorney General suggested the legislators could be arrested upon their return to Texas.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has weighed in on the controversy surrounding a new American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. After reports surfaced that Sweeney is a registered Republican, Trump praised the ad as "fantastic" and "the HOTTEST out there" on social media. The campaign, which uses the tagline "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," had been criticized by some for promoting eugenics or for being overly sexualized. Trump's comments link the ad campaign directly to the culture wars, framing support for it as a stand against "woke" culture and a win for Republicans.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the constitutional separation of church and state, a foundational American principle, is facing its most severe threat in history. The author contends that this principle has historically protected both religious freedom and government function from factionalism. However, recent legislative and judicial actions, such as using taxpayer money for religious schools and court decisions undermining the establishment clause, are eroding this "wall of separation." The piece warns that trading a system that has served the nation well for one that has failed elsewhere is a perilous choice for American democracy.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 23% on Monday, giving back a significant portion of the gains from its successful market debut last week. The stock, which had more than tripled on its first day of trading, saw its price drop to $94.50. Despite the decline, the company's valuation remains high, reflecting strong Wall Street appetite for profitable, high-growth tech companies. Figma's IPO was a notable event after a long quiet period for public offerings, and its initial success came after a planned acquisition by Adobe was called off due to regulatory opposition.

For the seaside town, which has seen its tourism industry decline, the club is a vital source of community identity, employment, and local business revenue.

          <p>Two bakery owners in Paterson, New Jersey, were slashed and stabbed by a customer who was allegedly angry about receiving the wrong sandwich four years prior. The assailant reportedly complained that an eggplant sandwich he was given in the past had made him ill. When the owners, brothers Abed and Mohammed Assad, tried to de-escalate the situation, the man pulled a knife, stabbing one in the chest and slashing the other's arm. The victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and the suspect remains at large as police continue their investigation into the bizarre and violent incident.</p>

The results also revealed a significant $3.8 billion write-down on its Kraft Heinz investment, which Warren Buffett has previously acknowledged was overpriced. Investors were further disappointed by the lack of any share repurchases in the first half of the year, even as the stock experienced a correction. The company's massive cash hoard remained near a record high at over $344 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

Owners of companies selling products from home décor to smart clocks say they cannot absorb the increased costs and will have to pass them on to consumers.
