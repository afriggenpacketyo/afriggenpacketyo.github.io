          <p>A SkyWest pilot flying into Minot, North Dakota, executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 bomber on a converging flight path. The pilot informed passengers that air traffic control, which lacks radar at the airport, failed to provide a warning about the military aircraft. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force are investigating the incident, which was reportedly captured on video by a spectator on the ground.</p>

          <p>Following the accidental drowning death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner at age 54, Bill Cosby shared his memories of his former on-screen son. In an interview, Cosby described Warner as a consummate professional and recalled their close, mentor-like relationship that continued long after "The Cosby Show" ended. Warner, who played Theo Huxtable, drowned in Costa Rica after being caught in a strong current. The article notes Cosby's own legal history, including his overturned sexual assault conviction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from cutting Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The defunding measure was part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" signed into law earlier in the month. Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the law likely unconstitutionally punishes Planned Parenthood affiliates that do not perform abortions. The administration argued the provision was intended to stop federal subsidies for abortion providers, while Planned Parenthood stated the cuts would severely impact non-abortion-related healthcare for over a million people.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests an unforeseen positive consequence of former President Trump's universal tariffs. The author argues that the economic pressure from these tariffs is compelling nations like Canada, China, and the European Union to address and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers and protectionist policies. By exposing this hypocrisy, the tariffs may be acting as a catalyst for these economic blocs to pursue reforms that could boost their own economies, potentially offsetting the negative impact of the U.S. measures.

          <p>Annie Farmer, an accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and a key witness against Ghislaine Maxwell, has urged the government to release all related case files, stating that if there is "nothing to hide," the information should be public. In a BBC interview, she expressed exhaustion over the politicization of the case and skepticism regarding the Trump administration's handling of the files. Farmer also voiced concern over the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey and rejected calls to pardon Maxwell, emphasizing the ongoing emotional toll on victims.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for the president's upcoming trip to Scotland. This action is viewed as retaliation for the newspaper's recent article detailing a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday. The White House defended the decision, stating news outlets are not guaranteed special access, while the White House Correspondents’ Association condemned it as an attack on the First Amendment. The incident occurs amid growing rifts between Trump and some supporters over the unreleased Epstein files.</p>

This acceleration, driven by factors like the planet's liquid core and atmospheric changes, is creating a long-term discrepancy with ultra-precise atomic clocks. The trend has become significant enough that timekeepers are contemplating the first-ever "negative leap second"—subtracting a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to realign it with Earth's rotation. This potential move raises concerns for computer systems and telecommunications, which rely on precise timekeeping and have never been tested for such an adjustment.</p>

          <p>The head of Sport England has formally expressed deep concern to the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, over the racist and sexist online abuse directed at the Lionesses, England's women's football team. The letter warns that this "toxic culture" threatens to undermine progress in female sports participation, highlighting that defender Jess Carter has been a target throughout the recent tournament. Sport England is urging the regulator to use the new Online Safety Act to take stronger action against the social media companies that allow such abuse to proliferate.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, has announced that the administration will now prioritize targeting sanctuary cities as part of its mass deportation campaign. Vowing to "flood the zone" with ICE agents, Homan's comments followed the shooting of an off-duty officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person. Homan stated that if local jails in these Democrat-run municipalities do not cooperate, federal agents will make arrests in the community, detaining anyone else present who is in the country illegally. The policy signals a significant escalation in the conflict between federal and local authorities over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that the Trump presidency is animated not by a guiding political philosophy but by a deep-seated and small-minded pettiness. The author contends that many of the administration's major decisions, from renaming military bases to sudden shifts in foreign policy on Ukraine, are reactions to personal slights and a desire for retribution. This culture of vengefulness, which the article claims is internalized by the president's lieutenants, results in chaotic and inconsistent governance that prioritizes settling personal scores over addressing substantive national problems.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to use two U.S. military bases, one in New Jersey and one in Indiana, to detain immigrants as part of the Trump administration's enforcement surge. According to correspondence obtained by NPR, the Pentagon has approved the request, which also includes expanding detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This move is a response to the administration's push to detain more people who are in the country illegally, as current ICE facilities are over capacity.

Despite reports of a robust economy, many individuals, like a Chengdu-based accountant who hasn't had a raise in five years, are struggling with stagnant wages and job insecurity. Experts note that households and businesses are feeling a significant downturn that is not reflected in the government's "rosy" data. This sentiment gap raises questions about the true health of the economy and the sustainability of its recovery in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The same federal judge who presided over President Trump's dropped lawsuit against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has been assigned to his new $10 billion libel case against Rupert Murdoch. Judge Darrin Gayles' assignment is notable because Trump previously withdrew the Cohen suit after the judge scheduled a deposition for the then-president. This raises the possibility that Trump may again have to decide whether to face questions under oath, this time from Murdoch's legal team, regarding his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, which was the subject of the Wall Street Journal article that prompted the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was arrested by ICE agents in Georgia while reporting on a protest, says the month-long detention has left him "emotionally destroyed." Guevara, a Salvadoran national with a work permit, believes his arrest is direct retaliation for his news coverage of ICE activities for his Spanish-language outlet. The Department of Homeland Security claims he was arrested for obstruction after refusing to comply with police orders. Guevara, who previously leaned Republican, says his experience has made him reconsider his political alignment and urges Latinos to oppose a president who acts against their community.</p>

          <p>According to a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), President Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the U.S. national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting corporations, and introduces new deductions. These revenue losses are only partially offset by an estimated $1.1 trillion in savings from major cuts to Medicaid and the national food stamp program. The CBO projects these cuts will result in 10 million Americans losing health insurance by 2034. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the presiding judge expressed skepticism, questioning how cutting funds for medical research would combat antisemitism and calling the government's claims "mind-boggling."
