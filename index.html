          <p>Monsoonal flow is causing heavy rain and scattered storms over parts of the Four Corners and Plains this weekend, with a Level 2 threat for excessive rainfall in eastern New Mexico and western Texas, potentially seeing 1 to 2 inches per hour. Ruidoso, New Mexico, remains on high alert for flooding along its burn scar, an area that has already experienced deadly flash floods this year. Concurrently, southern Florida is grappling with persistent hot and stormy weather, as the Miami area alone recorded over 10.51 inches of rain since Sunday. While scattered storms will continue next week, a slightly drier pattern is anticipated, offering some relief to the region.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of Tyler Robinson for the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, significant questions persist regarding the 22-year-old suspect's identity and motivations, exacerbating intense US political debates. Utah Governor Spencer Cox stated investigators believe Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," though specific evidence was not detailed. This incident has led some conservatives to soften attacks on Robinson as an individual, while redirecting anger towards liberals as a group, reflecting deep partisan divisions. The ongoing investigation aims to uncover the full context behind this politically charged act of violence.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk in Utah has sparked widespread public and media discussion about the discourse surrounding modern American political violence. Experts on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" noted a recurring pattern of regret and calls for de-escalation from both Democratic and Republican messaging after such acts. However, they questioned whether these sentiments would lead to enduring change, highlighting the persistent societal fractures. The incident underscores the challenges in fostering lasting unity and calls for a deeper examination of how political rhetoric contributes to an environment where violence can occur.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reportedly questioned Lord Mandelson about his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US. This scrutiny followed initial vetting that flagged their relationship, with specific questions raised about Mandelson's continued contact and alleged stays at Epstein's properties post-conviction. The recent revelation of supportive emails from Mandelson to Epstein, previously unavailable, ultimately led to Mandelson's sacking and has intensified pressure on Sir Keir regarding his judgment. The incident raises significant concerns about the thoroughness and integrity of Whitehall's vetting processes for high-level appointments.</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted for a nonbinding resolution supporting a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, urging Israel to commit to a Palestinian state. The "New York Declaration," sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, was approved 142-10, with the United States among those voting against it, calling it a "misguided publicity stunt" and a "gift to Hamas." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his rejection of a Palestinian state just hours before the vote, highlighting the deep divide.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking a $3.1 million fine from Boeing for safety violations that occurred between September 2023 and February 2024, including those linked to the January 2024 Alaska Airlines door plug blowout. Investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found Boeing's manufacturing and safety oversight, combined with ineffective FAA inspections, contributed to the incident. The regulator also cited instances where a Boeing employee pressured an ODA unit member to approve a 737 Max despite non-compliance. Boeing stated it is reviewing the penalty and is committed to enhancing its safety management and quality assurance under FAA oversight.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been arrested and charged with aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm in connection with the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities tracked Robinson's movements on campus, recovering a high-powered rifle and bullet casings inscribed with unusual messages. Utah Governor Spencer Cox revealed Robinson's father helped turn him in, though the suspect initially expressed suicidal ideation.

The deployment marks an escalation in Trump's use of troops, following a similar action in Washington D.C., raising concerns about using military against civilians.

However, an unexpected rise in consumer prices and the highest jobless claims in almost four years introduced some uncertainty for policymakers.

          <h2>NYC Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani Pledges to Arrest Benjamin Netanyahu if Elected</h2>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, has controversially pledged that if elected, he would order the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should he travel to New York. Mamdani alleges Netanyahu is a war criminal involved in genocide in Gaza and would honor an international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant issued in November 2024. Legal experts, however, doubt the practicality of such an action, noting the US does not recognize the ICC's authority and President Trump has sanctioned the court. Mamdani's stance reflects growing support for Palestinians among New Yorkers but is expected to provoke strong reactions in the city.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have detained Hasan Mutlu, the mayor of Istanbul's Bayrampasa district, along with dozens of city officials, on allegations of corruption including extortion, bribery, and bid rigging. This incident is part of an intensifying crackdown on Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), which Mutlu vehemently denies are politically motivated, calling them "political operations and baseless slander." Numerous CHP mayors and staff have been arrested in recent months, leading to significant protests following the detention of former Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The situation raises concerns about the independence of the judiciary and the state of democracy in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook referred to a condominium she purchased in June 2021 as a "vacation home" in a loan estimate, a detail that could undermine President Donald Trump's claims of mortgage fraud against her. Trump sought to fire Cook "for cause," alleging she simultaneously claimed two properties as primary residences to gain better mortgage terms. Cook, who has sued to block her firing and secured an injunction, described the property as a "second home" in security clearance forms. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the allegations, which have become central to Trump's efforts to reshape the central bank.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has vehemently denied knowledge of an alleged scheme to circumvent the NBA's salary cap, reportedly involving Kawhi Leonard and a now-bankrupt company, Aspiration, partially funded by Ballmer. The NBA has launched an investigation into accusations that $28 million was funneled to Leonard via a "no-show" endorsement deal. Ballmer stated he introduced Aspiration to Leonard but was unaware of the contract details, claiming he was "conned" by Aspiration's fraudulent founders. This controversy adds to the ongoing issues for Leonard, who has faced significant knee problems throughout his career.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing popularity of lip oils has raised questions about their safety, particularly after some users reported hyperpigmentation. Dr. Rebecca Small, a clinical professor at UCSF, explains that lip skin is thin and susceptible to sun damage and irritation, which can lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. She advises consumers to prioritize ingredients over brand names, recommending lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF, linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid. Conversely, she warns against fragrances and oleic acids, emphasizing that safe lip oils can be beneficial for hydration and shine. Consulting a medical professional for severe symptoms is also recommended.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to begin migrant return flights to France next week, implementing a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme agreed upon by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Dozens of migrants detained in Dover are expected to be deported, with formal removal directions already issued, and the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers from France in return. This policy, part of the Labour government's broader efforts to tackle small boat crossings, has been described as "grown-up diplomacy" by Starmer, though critics, including the Conservatives, question its workability and potential for abuse.</p>
