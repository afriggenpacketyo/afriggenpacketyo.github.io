          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the initial vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The original election saw a far-right, pro-Russian candidate surprisingly leading in the first round, prompting an investigation into campaign financing and organization. Voters are now choosing between pro-EU candidates and hard-right figures, with the outcome potentially influencing Romania's stance on European integration and support for Ukraine. The decision to annul the election and ban the initial frontrunner has drawn criticism from various international figures, adding further complexity to the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Canton Fair, China's largest trade exhibition, is experiencing a surge in international buyers, particularly from Latin America and Central Asia, while the presence of American buyers has decreased.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches, arguing that it's another way of making mothers feel guilty about their parenting choices. The author points out that while concerns about ultra-processed foods and sugar content are valid, the moral judgment placed on mothers for using convenient options like pouches is excessive. The article highlights the societal pressures on women to engage in intensive mothering and the unrealistic expectations of cooking everything from scratch. The author also argues that the debate often ignores the social, political, and economic factors that influence parents' choices, such as time constraints and access to resources.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become Prime Minister is no longer a far-fetched idea, given Reform's recent electoral success in England's local elections. Reform has won its first parliamentary by-election and mayoral race. Laura Kuenssberg notes that Farage has changed the political landscape, posing a challenge to both Labour and the Conservatives. Reform's success reflects public disillusionment with the political system, with the party focusing on issues that resonate with voters.

          <p>Australia's Liberal party is in turmoil after a crushing defeat in the federal election, with leader Peter Dutton losing his seat. The party faces a search for a new leader and a period of reflection on what went wrong. The article notes that the losses were particularly severe in major cities. Some party members have called for a serious review. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese emphasized unity after Labor's victory, which was won on a message of unity rather than division.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law that allocates $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. This move fulfills a campaign promise and marks a significant victory for school choice advocates. Supporters argue that it provides more options for parents, while critics contend it will drain resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. The program will provide families with $10,000 per year, with higher amounts for children with disabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president in 2024 foreshadowed a significant shift in his approach to governance. Unlike potential running mates who represented the pre-2016 Republican Party, Vance embodied the MAGA movement and prioritized loyalty above all else. This choice signaled Trump's preference for surrounding himself with courtiers who would not challenge his decisions. Klein suggests that the absence of moderating influences in Trump's second term has led to a more uninhibited and potentially reckless presidency.</p>
