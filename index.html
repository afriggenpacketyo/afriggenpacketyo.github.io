          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, according to border czar Tom Homan. This decision follows immigration raids in the area that sparked mass protests, with police using tear gas on bystanders. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem condemned the protesters, while California governor Gavin Newsom criticized the raids as reckless and cruel. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, stated that the activity was meant to sow terror, and acting ICE director Todd Lyons rebuked her response. The events highlight the ongoing tension between federal immigration enforcement and local opposition. The situation reflects a broader national debate over immigration policy and enforcement. </p>

          <p>Sovereignty secured victory over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of the Kentucky Derby's top two finishers. Sovereignty, with 2-to-1 odds, is the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness, and then win the Belmont; Junior Alvarado, Sovereignty's jockey, had previously faced a fine and suspension for his Derby performance. The Belmont took place at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles. Journalism, the Preakness winner, finished second, making it the only horse to compete in all three Triple Crown races this year. The victory underscores Sovereignty's dominance in major horse racing events. </p>

The CDC reports that the actual number of affected individuals is likely higher, as many recover without medical intervention. Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, and can be fatal in vulnerable populations.

          <p>A feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has intensified concerns about NASA's budget, which faces significant cuts. The proposed budget would slash funding for science projects by nearly half, potentially halting 40 science missions. Trump has also threatened to withdraw federal contracts from Musk's SpaceX, a key partner for NASA in resupplying the International Space Station and future lunar missions. Critics argue that the budget prioritizes lunar and Martian missions at the expense of other vital scientific endeavors, potentially undermining international collaborations and long-term space exploration efforts. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Elon Musk would face "serious consequences" if he supports Democratic candidates who oppose Republicans supporting the "big, beautiful bill." Trump also indicated that his relationship with Musk is likely over after their recent public dispute. He accused Musk of being "disrespectful to the office of the president" and emphasized that he had previously given Musk "breaks" during his administration. These remarks signal a further deterioration in the relationship between Trump and the billionaire entrepreneur. </p>
