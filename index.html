          <p>Peter Coker Jr. was sentenced to 40 months in prison for securities fraud related to artificially inflating the stock prices of Hometown International, a deli owner, and E-Waste, a related shell company; his attorney cited brutal conditions in a Thai prison where Coker Jr. was held awaiting extradition and his severe cirrhosis of the liver. Coker Jr. expressed remorse for his actions and how they affected his parents, while his father, Peter Coker Sr., received a six-month jail sentence followed by six months of home confinement, along with a $500,000 fine and restitution. The judge deemed the companies worthless and the scheme a sophisticated fraud that caused harm to investors, emphasizing that Coker Sr.'s age influenced the leniency of his sentence.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee's Credentials subcommittee has suggested redoing the vice-chair elections due to concerns about the original balloting process, potentially jeopardizing the positions of current vice chairs David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta. The recommendation stems from a challenge filed by Kalyn Free, a vice chair candidate, who alleged that the voting process unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta. Hogg claimed the vote is related to his efforts to reform the Democratic Party, while Kenyatta voiced frustration that Hogg is making the issue about himself. DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed disappointment about the procedural error in the February elections and reiterated his support for all the officers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first federal court hearing on President Trump's tariffs, judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade expressed concerns about the administration's claim that the judiciary cannot review the legality of the tariffs. The case, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, centers on whether the tariffs meet the International Emergency Economic Powers Act's requirement of dealing with an "unusual and extraordinary threat." While the judges questioned the administration's broad interpretation of presidential power, they also struggled to define what constitutes such a threat, and the court's decision may ultimately have limited influence over the Supreme Court, which is likely to have the final say.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the stock market recovering to pre-tariff levels and a lower-than-expected inflation reading, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty about the final level of tariffs. Many investors feel compelled to participate in the market rally, but lack conviction about the economy's direction, while signs of tariff-fueled inflation are not likely to appear in economic data for months. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, hesitant to lower interest rates until the inflationary impact of tariffs is known, and uncertainty is causing businesses to delay investments and consumers to reduce spending. While the dollar has regained some ground, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies remains significantly below its peak, indicating underlying economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proceeding with their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts, despite ongoing internal disputes over key issues such as the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. The proposal includes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for organizations offering abortion services. While the plan avoids some of the more drastic cuts pushed by Republican hardliners, it still faces opposition from both moderate Republicans concerned about Medicaid cuts and conservatives seeking deeper reductions, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured as a result. The Ways and Means Committee is also working on tax provisions, including extending Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts and increasing the debt ceiling, while facing pushback from moderate Republicans over the SALT deduction cap.</p>

Mental health advocates urge the administration to defend the regulations, arguing they are essential to making parity a practical reality, while opponents contend that the issue lies in a shortage of mental health care providers, not insurance policies.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate hit 2.3% in April, lower than expected and the lowest since February 2021, according to the Labor Department. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, with the core CPI also increasing 0.2%, and shelter prices remained the main driver of inflation. While the monthly readings were slightly higher than in March, the news was welcomed as inflationary pressures are well off their highs from three years ago.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, continues to publish misleading or inaccurate claims on its "Wall of Receipts," touting purported savings that often prove to be exaggerated or incorrect. CBS News has identified errors, including claiming savings from contracts that were not canceled and deleting contracts with purported savings, raising questions about the accuracy and transparency of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts. Despite these inconsistencies, DOGE maintains that the "Wall of Receipts" is a model of transparency, while critics argue that the savings are overstated and that the true financial impact remains uncertain.</p>

The State Department later terminated the grant, citing convenience, despite a court order to release the funds. Stiglitz argues that this incident reveals the Trump administration's willingness to extend control to even the smallest ventures, suppressing academic freedom and the ability to discuss important topics like diversity and inclusion.</p>
