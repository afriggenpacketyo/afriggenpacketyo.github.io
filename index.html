          <p>A missile launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen caused a temporary halt to flights at Israel's Ben-Gurion International Airport, creating panic among passengers. The attack, which lightly wounded four people, occurred amidst escalating tensions and hours before Israeli ministers were set to vote on intensifying military operations in Gaza. Houthi military officials claimed responsibility, stating they targeted the airport with a hypersonic ballistic missile in solidarity with Palestinians. Israeli Defense Minister vowed retribution for the attack, raising concerns about further escalation in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war and tariffs on Chinese goods are posing a threat to the Panama Canal, a critical passage for U.S. East Coast-bound container traffic. The uncertainty and high tariffs have led to a significant pause in U.S. imports from China, resulting in a surge of canceled freight vessels and potential revenue losses for the canal. The Panama Canal Authority acknowledges that any recession in the U.S. or worldwide will impact the canal's revenue, as the U.S. is the top user of the canal. The article also notes Trump's previous claims about China controlling key ports of the canal, which have been denied by both China and Panama. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cold case from Wisconsin involving a missing mother, Audrey Backeberg, has been resolved after more than 60 years, with the Sauk County Sheriff's Office reporting that she is alive and well. Backeberg disappeared in 1962 at the age of 20, and the investigation revealed that she left by her own choice, with no evidence of criminal activity or foul play. Initial reports suggested she may have abandoned her children, but the sheriff's office has now confirmed her disappearance was voluntary. The case was reopened earlier this year, leading to the discovery of Backeberg's whereabouts.</p>

The comments came amidst criticism over the deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported.

          <p>China rejected Japan's claim that a Chinese coast guard helicopter entered its airspace near the Senkaku Islands, blaming the incident on a Japanese civilian aircraft. Liu Jinsong, of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, protested the "intrusion of a civilian aircraft operated by Japan's right-winger." Japan reiterated its protest over the airspace violation, demanding measures to prevent similar incidents. The incident has heightened tensions between the two countries over the disputed islands.</p>

The city's government will consist of a mayor and two commissioners with power over planning, taxation, and other local issues.

          <p>This article discusses Sarah Snook's one-actor take on The Picture of Dorian Gray, now on Broadway, drawing parallels between the story's themes of vanity and image obsession with modern social media culture. Snook plays 26 roles, using elaborate camerawork and a smartphone to broadcast herself to a giant screen. This highlights the gap between false perfection and reality, and the pleasure derived from deception. The production uses social media tropes to critique the ways performing a persona can rot away an interior life.</p>

          <p>Despite warning signs that Donald Trump's tariffs were destabilizing the US economy, Republican leaders in Congress moved to protect his trade policy. A Senate resolution targeting the tariffs was blocked after the White House issued a veto threat and the House prevented its consideration. The vote took place against the backdrop of data showing the US economy shrank in the first three months of the year, a consequence of the tariffs, economists say. The Republican party is doubling down on the tariffs despite potential economic consequences.</p>
