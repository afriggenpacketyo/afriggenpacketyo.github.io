          <p>South Korea's foreign minister is traveling to the United States following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction in Georgia, where over 300 South Korean workers were detained. The incident has strained relations, especially after Seoul recently committed to hundreds of billions in U.S. investments and energy purchases. While the workers are set to be flown home, the raid has sparked feelings of betrayal in South Korea and raised concerns about the future of foreign investment projects in the U.S. The Trump administration defended the action, stating the workers lacked proper visas.</p>

The incident occurred after Phillips, an experienced bushman, was spotted during a reported robbery and engaged in a shootout with officers, seriously injuring one. His children, who were with him in the wilderness, were found unharmed at a remote campsite later in the day. The case had captivated the nation for years, with Phillips evading a nationwide search while occasionally being sighted during break-ins for supplies.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the adoption of autonomous trucking is essential for the American freight industry to address critical issues like a severe driver shortage and rising logistics costs. The author contends that self-driving trucks are not a threat to jobs but a necessary evolution, similar to how ATMs ultimately led to growth in banking employment. Citing fierce global competition, particularly from China, the piece advocates for clear and consistent regulations to foster innovation, pointing to Texas as a successful model. The technology is presented as a way to enhance safety, improve efficiency, and secure America's economic future.</p>

          <p>WNBA star Caitlin Clark's season-ending groin injury has been met with outrage, but this article argues the anger is not about her well-being but about the loss of a symbol for culture warriors. The author contends that a toxic segment of her followers has used her as a "great white hope" to fuel narratives of grievance and racial tension within the league. The decision to shut her down for the season is presented as the only medically sensible choice to protect her long-term career, a move that should be a relief to genuine fans. However, for those who use her for political purposes, her absence removes their primary weapon.</p>

          <p>States across the U.S. are facing difficult budget decisions and cutting essential programs due to major reductions in federal health funding initiated by the Trump administration. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is set to slash billions from Medicaid and other public health initiatives, shifting significant costs onto states already strained by economic uncertainty. In response, some states are halting projects, creating trust funds to backfill programs, or providing emergency grants to nonprofits.

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man charged with attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, has begun in Florida. Routh is accused of positioning himself with a rifle near Trump's West Palm Beach golf club in September of last year before being spotted by a Secret Service agent and fleeing. The case is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who previously dismissed charges against Trump in the classified documents case. Routh, who has a prior criminal record, has chosen to represent himself in court with his former public defenders serving as standby counsel.</p>

          <p>Long-standing dietary guidelines that have advised consumers to choose low-fat or fat-free dairy products are being challenged by evolving scientific research. New studies suggest that the saturated fat from dairy does not impact cardiovascular health as negatively as previously thought, with some evidence indicating potential benefits from full-fat options like whole milk and cheese. This shift in understanding is expected to be reflected in forthcoming U.S. dietary guidelines from the Trump administration. Researchers now argue that the overall dietary pattern is more important than the fat content of a single food group like dairy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has doubled tariffs to 50% on many Indian goods, penalizing the country for becoming a major buyer of discounted Russian crude oil and a subsequent exporter of refined oil products. An analysis found that the U.S. itself is a significant customer for these Indian-refined products, with one refinery that supplies over 90% of U.S. imports sourcing nearly half its crude from Russia. This creates a circular flow of funds that indirectly benefits the Kremlin. While India has projected defiance, shipping data suggests its imports from Russia may have dipped following the tariff threats.</p>

The process of switching to natural colorants derived from sources like beets and turmeric is complex, as these alternatives are often more expensive, less stable, and can alter the taste of foods. Companies are investing heavily to achieve the same vibrant hues that consumers have come to expect, haunted by the infamous consumer backlash against a duller, naturally colored version of Trix cereal a decade ago. This highlights the deep-seated association between bright colors and perceived taste in the American market.</p>

          <p>FIFA is launching ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup with a new and controversial pricing model that could make attending games more expensive. The system, described as "variable pricing," will allow ticket prices to fluctuate based on demand, similar to how airlines and hotels operate. While FIFA has advertised some group-stage tickets starting at an accessible $60, this new model means prices could rise significantly in real-time. With over 5 million spectators expected for the expanded 48-team tournament, demand is projected to be immense, raising concerns about affordability for average fans.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city's public education system has been completely rebuilt, but not without significant pain and controversy. After the storm, the district fired its entire staff of 7,500 employees, most of whom were experienced Black teachers, and replaced them with a younger, less experienced workforce from programs like Teach for America. While data shows academic metrics like test scores and graduation rates have improved, the shift displaced a generation of veteran educators and fundamentally altered the community's relationship with its schools.

Business groups, however, have strongly opposed the bill, arguing that provisions like "day one rights" would discourage hiring and investment.

          <p>Cyprus has approached the United Arab Emirates to explore a potential partnership on a major EU-financed subsea power cable designed to connect Europe with the eastern Mediterranean. The Cypriot president confirmed the discussions, which aim to secure investment for the 1.9 billion euro project linking Greece, Cyprus, and later Israel. This move reaffirms Cyprus's commitment to the project, which has faced delays and is currently under investigation by European prosecutors for possible criminal offenses. The proposed link would be the world's longest and deepest high-voltage subsea cable.</p>

          <p>A former British Army sergeant major has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting 19-year-old Gunner Jaysley Beck, who took her own life in December 2021 after the incident. Beck had reported that Michael Webber pinned her down and tried to kiss her, but an inquest found the Army's handling of her complaint contributed to her death. Superiors reportedly pressured her to drop the allegations and failed to report the sexual assault to the police, instead recording it as "inappropriate behaviour." The soldier's family stated they believe she would still be alive if the chain of command had properly handled her report.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old high school student armed with a shotgun attacked a police station in Izmir, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding two others and a civilian.

Elsewhere, U.S. stock futures were stable as markets await key inflation data later in the week that could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his debut with the Pittsburgh Steelers, quarterback Aaron Rodgers led his new team to a 34-32 victory over the New York Jets, the team he played for during two difficult seasons. The 41-year-old Rodgers threw for 244 yards and four touchdowns, demonstrating that he can still effectively lead an offense when surrounded by key weapons and a complementary system. While no longer the dynamic MVP of his Green Bay years, Rodgers showed a willingness to adapt his game, playing as a quick-trigger point guard within the Steelers' offensive scheme. The win provided a measure of revenge and suggested he may have one great season left.</p>

          <p>Private equity giants are intensifying their recruitment efforts, raiding Wall Street investment banks for top talent, particularly in fundraising and investor relations roles. After a period of slow dealmaking, firms are now hiring aggressively to position themselves for an anticipated market rebound, creating a competitive talent war. This has prompted banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to implement stricter rules to prevent their junior analysts from being poached. The allure of private equity remains strong due to the potential for carried interest, a share of fund profits that can vastly exceed traditional banking compensation.</p>

          <p>While teenagers like Liverpool's Rio Ngumoha are making headlines, football history is filled with young talents who broke through early but failed to achieve sustained success. This article examines the careers of several former Premier League 'wonderkids,' including the league's youngest-ever goalscorer James Vaughan, who struggled with injuries and the pressure of early fame. Experts note that while clubs now have better player care systems, the challenges of money, media attention, and the daily grind of professional football can derail promising careers. The key, they argue, is ensuring young players develop an identity beyond just being a footballer.</p>

          <p>Norwegians are heading to the polls for a parliamentary election where the ruling Labour Party is anticipated to win a narrow victory and remain in power. Opinion polls suggest the left-leaning alliance will secure a slim majority in parliament, though with fewer seats than in the 2021 election. The campaign has been dominated by domestic issues such as inflation and the quality of public services. However, international political instability, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. tariff policies, has also been a key topic, potentially benefiting the incumbent government as voters seek stability.</p>

Takaichi, a protege of the late Shinzo Abe, is seen as a candidate with strong policy ideas, while Koizumi is viewed as a safer, more consensus-oriented choice. The political uncertainty comes as Japan grapples with a cost-of-living crisis and the aftermath of a contentious trade deal with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland's style of play as reliant on "a lot of long balls" and "not brilliant to watch," which former Northern Ireland players turned pundits labeled as disrespectful. They pointed out that Germany also frequently used long balls during the match. The pundits suggested Nagelsmann's comments were a way to deflect from his own team's lackluster performance against a lower-ranked opponent, adding that his words will likely fuel a hostile atmosphere for the reverse fixture in Belfast.</p>
