          <p>South Korea's People Power Party (PPP) has selected Kim Moon Soo as their candidate for the June 3 presidential election, following Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment. Kim, a former Labor Minister, secured 56.5% of the votes in the party primary, surpassing his rival, Han Dong-hun. He has expressed a commitment to forming a strong alliance to counter liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung, who is currently facing multiple criminal trials. Kim has also pledged to implement incentives for businesses and innovation, signaling a conservative vision for the country and a firm stance against North Korea. The election aims to find a successor to Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly in December. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the Labour MP for York Outer, is calling for a reconsideration of the 1985 legislation that prohibits fans from consuming alcohol in view of the pitch at the top five tiers of men's football in England. Charters argues that this ban creates an inconsistency compared to other sports where alcohol consumption is permitted, and proposes trials to assess the impact of lifting the restrictions. The Football Supporters Association (FSA) supports this call, and trials are already underway in the women's game, which is not subject to the 1985 ban. Charters suggests starting with small-scale trials in the lower leagues to determine the best approach, emphasizing responsible drinking and family zones where alcohol would not be appropriate.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma seeking public funding, a decision pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. The author raises concerns about the Catholic Church's history of sexual abuse allegations and questions the need for taxpayer money to fund Catholic schools.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to rising temperatures in Alaska, the National Weather Service offices in Juneau and Fairbanks will issue heat advisories for the first time this summer. Alaska is warming two to three times faster than the global average, leading to hazardous conditions and increased wildfire risk. The advisories will be issued when temperatures reach 75 degrees in outlying regions around Fairbanks and 85 degrees in the interior. The rising temperatures, coupled with increasing wildfire smoke, pose challenges for residents, as homes built to retain heat can become dangerously hot during the long summer days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Autonomous University of Baja California have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in the wild, offering hope for the critically endangered species. The study tracked 18 axolotls released in Mexico City wetlands, finding that they gained weight and adapted to their new environment, demonstrating their ability to hunt and avoid predators. Axolotls, native to Mexico's capital, are popular among medical researchers for their regenerative abilities. The success of the axolotls in both artificial and restored wetlands suggests that man-made habitats could help mitigate the impacts of habitat degradation and climate change.</p>

          <p>This article examines the increasingly erratic and nonsensical posts made by Donald Trump on his social media platform, Truth Social. It categorizes these posts into attacks on perceived enemies, reposts of praise, and no-context images, highlighting the president's inconsistent use of language and punctuation. The article notes that these posts, often consisting of diatribes about judges and tariffs, are interspersed with advertisements and seemingly random content. The analysis suggests that Trump's behavior on Truth Social reflects a disregard for traditional decorum and a tendency towards unhinged communication.</p>

          <p>Researchers at a Chinese defense electronics institute claim to have developed a method to track advanced US stealth radars using modified commercial equipment. The study suggests that commercially available spectrum analyzers can pinpoint emissions from US low-probability-of-intercept radar (LPIR) with high accuracy, even through electronic jamming. This development, if verified, could potentially alter the dynamics of electronic warfare. LPIR is widely used in US air and missile defense systems, as well as stealth bombers and fighters.</p>

The piece highlights the irony of focusing on cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting while extending tax cuts for the wealthy, suggesting that Republicans are wary of being associated with DOGE's harmful actions.</p>

          <p>A dispute over the progressive news site Knock LA has escalated into dueling lawsuits between a group of independent journalists and the advocacy group Ground Game LA. The journalists, including Cerise Castle and Ben Camacho, allege copyright and trademark infringement, defamation, and theft of trade secrets. Ground Game LA, which formed Knock LA, accuses the journalists of attempting to hijack the news outlet and misusing its trademarks. The conflict centers on control of the site's content and resources, with both sides claiming the other has acted unlawfully and exploited their work. The legal battle underscores the tensions within Los Angeles' left-leaning political landscape.</p>

          <p>Adam Schleifer, a former federal prosecutor, claims his dismissal was influenced by Andrew Wiederhorn, the former CEO of Fat Brands, who allegedly spread "smears" to the White House through conservative pundits. Schleifer alleges he was fired for his prosecution of Wiederhorn, who was indicted on federal charges including a $47-million "sham loan" scheme and illegal firearm possession. Schleifer's filing included an email notifying him of his removal, sent "on behalf of President Trump," and he claims he was fired for his "engagement in constitutionally protected political activity." Wiederhorn has maintained his innocence in the criminal cases. The case raises questions about the intersection of politics, justice, and corporate influence.</p>

          <p>Women in the Bay Area are leading the nation in delaying motherhood, with Marin County having the highest proportion of women giving birth at 40 and older. This trend is attributed to economic opportunities, progressive social norms, and access to reproductive technology. The region embraces diverse family structures and lacks traditional societal pressures, allowing women to prioritize careers and life experiences before starting a family. Many Bay Area companies also offer comprehensive fertility benefits, encouraging women to focus on their careers while preserving their options for future motherhood.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is facing a staffing shortage after offering employees deferred resignation packages, leading to voluntary departures. Despite the Trump administration's plan to reduce the federal workforce, APHIS is now urgently seeking to fill 73 critical positions, including scientists, budget analysts, and inspectors. This situation has angered employees who accepted the resignation offer, as the agency is now effectively paying two salaries for the same roles. The agency declined to comment on the rationale behind offering incentives to employees in mission-critical positions. The USDA maintains it is optimizing the workforce while ensuring critical work continues.</p>

          <p>Cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, are increasing in the United States, with 8,485 cases reported in 2025, double the number from the same time last year. Experts attribute the surge to a combination of factors, including a natural peak in the disease cycle and declining vaccination rates. The disease is most dangerous for infants, and health officials are urging pregnant women to get vaccinated to protect their newborns. Several states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, are experiencing significant outbreaks, prompting concerns about the impact on public health resources.</p>

The plan includes sending Wang Xiaohong, Chinaâ€™s Minister of Public Security, to Washington to lead talks. The move comes as both countries face economic challenges from the trade war and are looking for ways to find common ground. China has previously used cooperation on fentanyl as leverage in its relationship with the U.S., but has also resisted pressure to take action, claiming it is a reflection of Washingtonâ€™s failure to address social problems.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the issue of "elderspeak," a form of communication that resembles baby talk and is often used with older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairments. The article highlights a new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) that teaches aides to address older people as adults, reducing the use of inappropriate endearments and simplified language. Studies have shown that reducing elderspeak can decrease resistant behaviors and potentially lower the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes. The article also explores cultural differences and offers advice on how individuals can politely push back against elderspeak.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), a teaching union, is launching legal action against Ofsted over proposed changes to school inspections in England. The NAHT is seeking a judicial review of plans to introduce new school report cards, arguing that they represent "another crude grading system" that will negatively impact school leaders. The decision follows concerns raised by the sister of head teacher Ruth Perry, who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, and a letter signed by multiple teaching unions warning of the detrimental impact on staff wellbeing. Ofsted maintains that the proposals support mental health and that the union's legal claims are untenable.</p>
