          <p>The article discusses the importance of saving money and using savings accounts, especially high-yield ones, to maximize interest earnings. As of May 14, 2025, the national average savings account interest rate is 0.41%, but high-yield savings accounts offer rates between 4.10% and 4.40%. Online banks often provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs, and the article advises comparing different accounts to find the most favorable terms and avoid fees.

          <p>The article, originally published in the New York Times, reports that overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data showed declines in all major drug categories, with fatalities dropping in most states. Experts attribute this to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, despite the progress, drug fatalities remain high, and proposed budget cuts to addiction programs raise concerns about sustaining the improvement.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning," highlighting the film's impressive stunts but criticizing its heavy reliance on exposition and complex plot. The film, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is described as tonally ending from the beginning and lacking the sense of play found in earlier installments. While the cast, including Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg, deliver strong performances, the plot weighs everything down, leaving little room for suspense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to revise some of the new PFAS drinking water limits set in April 2024, raising concerns about the safety of US drinking water. The EPA is targeting limits for four PFAS compounds, but faces legal challenges due to the Safe Drinking Water Act's "anti-backsliding" rule. The water utility industry is opposing the limits, and the move highlights the need for reform in the water utility industry.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic observers said the US-China agreement to roll back tariffs on each other’s goods by 115 per cent represented success for Beijing’s defiant strategy against “economic bullying”, and also offered some early experience on how to deal with President Donald Trump 2.0 over the next four years. However, they cautioned that the 90-day truce would not avoid long-term confrontations and called for early preparation to deal with the persisting sticking points and structural divide in bilateral ties.</p>
