          <p>In a recent interview, United CEO Scott Kirby discussed air traffic control issues at Newark International Airport, emphasizing the safety measures in place, including backup procedures and pilot training. Kirby acknowledged customer concerns regarding safety and the potential impact of economic factors like tariffs on the travel industry. United has proactively reduced flights to accommodate airport capacity and maintain on-time arrivals. The CEO expressed optimism about upgrading the air traffic control system and assured the public that safety remains the top priority, despite potential financial impacts.

          <p>Patricia Clarkson stars in "Lilly," a film about Lilly Ledbetter's fight for equal pay, inspired by the real-life activist's experiences at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Clarkson portrays Ledbetter's journey, highlighting the misogyny and ageism she faced while advocating for fair compensation. Ledbetter's case led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which President Obama signed in 2009, effectively ending the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims. Clarkson emphasizes the universal themes of struggle and injustice, finding inspiration in her own mother's activism and connecting with the character's resilience.</p>

          <p>A group of Quakers are marching over 300 miles from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants. The march is rooted in the Quaker tradition of peaceful activism, advocating for justice and peace. Organizers aim to show solidarity with migrants and other targeted groups, delivering the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document promoting religious freedom. They believe the document's call for inclusivity remains relevant today, as they decry what they view as the administration's disregard for constitutional law and human dignity.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from abroad in an effort to reduce net migration. The government aims to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. This measure is expected to decrease lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year. The government plans to raise the threshold for skilled visas and narrow exceptions for temporary shortage visas, while also implementing training commitments to reintegrate unemployed individuals into the UK labor market.</p>

Means gained prominence in right-leaning wellness circles for her criticism of mainstream medicine and advocacy for a healthier food supply. Her nomination is influenced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, Means' nomination faces hurdles due to her inactive medical license and opposition from right-wing activists who question her qualifications and views on vaccines.</p>

          <p>This article examines the selective application of 'freedom of choice' within the Trump administration, contrasting its promotion in economic and consumer contexts with its restriction in political and social spheres. It argues that the administration champions consumer choice while simultaneously limiting options for citizens regarding political ideologies, expression, and personal identities. The piece contends this trend reflects a new form of authoritarianism that selectively embraces libertarianism only in the realm of consumerism, contrasting with historical trends linking economic and political freedoms. The author explores the historical roots of choice and its role in modern democracies, warning against the erosion of political choice under the current administration.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Elon Musk's partnership with President Trump is ending, with Musk as the clear loser. Musk's reputation has been damaged by his controversial actions and criticisms of the president, leading to plummeting Tesla sales. While SpaceX and Starlink may still benefit from government contracts, the author argues that Musk's attempt to act as an unelected co-president ultimately failed due to the inherent limitations of the American system. The piece concludes that there is no room for an unelected figure to wield such power, and that Musk's downfall serves as a reminder of the importance of elected officials and the confirmation process.</p>

          <p>This article examines instances where US media organizations have appeared to yield to Donald Trump's influence, with billionaire owners potentially prioritizing access and avoiding conflict over journalistic independence. Examples include the Washington Post's editorial overhaul, the Los Angeles Times dropping its endorsement of Kamala Harris, and CBS News considering settling a lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview. The article raises concerns about the erosion of journalistic integrity and the potential chilling effect on critical reporting, despite individual journalists largely resisting these influences.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's Chinese-made weapons have demonstrated effectiveness against India's Western and Russian-supplied arms in the ongoing Kashmir conflict. Tensions escalated after India conducted military strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, responding to a terrorist attack. Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian fighter aircraft, including three French-made Rafale jets, although India has not confirmed these claims. The conflict highlights the growing role of Chinese military technology in regional power dynamics.</p>

          <p>After losing their home in the January 7 Palisades Fire, a couple decided to relocate to Spain due to their disillusionment with the current political climate in the United States. The author describes the bureaucratic challenges of rebuilding and the growing anxiety caused by the Trump administration's policies. The couple, with German passports, chose to move to Europe, viewing it as a more prudent and positive option than rebuilding in a country they no longer feel aligned with. While acknowledging their privilege, they express hope to return and rebuild their home in the Palisades when the US becomes more appealing.</p>

          <p>An interview explores the phenomenon of doomsday prepping, arguing it's deeply ingrained in American culture and self-reliance. The discussion covers the spectrum from high-end survival kits to the ultra-rich buying land in New Zealand. The interviewee suggests prepping is driven by a distrust of government response to disasters, leading individuals to take responsibility for their own preparedness. Grid failure is cited as a major concern, and the question is raised whether the goal is to survive alone or to confront challenges collectively.</p>

While Hill acknowledges its limitations, the plus-minus stat has become widely used in basketball to assess a player's impact on the team's performance. The concept reflects the importance of teamwork and doing the little things right, which Hill learned from his coach John Wooden.</p>
