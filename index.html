        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The past 24 hours have marked a significant escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, with the United States directly intervening by launching airstrikes on three critical Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. This action follows a period of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, including preemptive strikes and retaliatory measures. In response to the U.S. strikes, Iran's parliament has voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital chokepoint for global oil transit, potentially disrupting energy supplies. While the decision to close the Strait rests with Iran's national security council, the situation has already caused oil prices to rise, with analysts warning of a potential surge to $100 a barrel if the Strait is closed and Western forces intervene.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran's parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transit, but experts suggest this move could backfire. Closing the Strait risks alienating Iran's neighbors and major trade partners, particularly China, which is a primary customer for Iranian oil. Analysts believe that Iran is unlikely to take such a drastic step, as it would cause significant self-inflicted harm by disrupting its own oil exports and provoking a strong response from the U.S. and Israel. While there are no current threats to commercial shipping, the potential disruption could lead to higher energy prices, with some analysts predicting prices could climb if the Strait is blocked.</p>

          <p>A national investigation into maternity care within the National Health Service (NHS) has been announced following a series of scandals involving the loss of babies and avoidable harm to families. The inquiry, set to begin this summer and report back by December 2025, will urgently examine the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services across the country, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. NHS leaders have apologized to affected families, and the review will be co-produced with victims to ensure their voices are heard and to prevent future failures in care. The investigation will consist of two parts: an urgent examination of concerning maternity units and a system-wide look at maternity and neonatal care to create a national set of actions for improvement.</p>

          <p>A new study in Nature Communications reveals that climate change is exacerbating sleep apnea, with the likelihood of experiencing sleep apnea problems increasing by almost 50% when temperatures rise to 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer. Severe cases of sleep apnea, where breathing stops more than 30 times per hour, also increase by 40%. The study, which analyzed sleep data from over 125,000 people across 41 countries, found that the risk of severe sleep apnea nearly doubled in northern countries like Europe and Russia. Experts emphasize the need to address climate change and control sleep environments to mitigate the impact of rising temperatures on sleep quality.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief has expressed his shock and frustration over a planned protest in support of Palestine Action in London, an organization he describes as an "organised extremist criminal group." The protest is supported by 35 groups, but the Met has imposed conditions, limiting the protest to a specific time and excluding a large area of Westminster. This comes after Palestine Action activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, protesting the UK's support of Israel, leading the Home Secretary to consider branding the group a terrorist organization. The group claims their actions are to disrupt the supply chain to what they describe as "genocide", allegations Israel strongly denies.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a bill that would have banned all THC consumables, allowing the state's booming market of THC-infused products to continue. The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture, or sell consumable THC products, representing one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country. Critics argued the ban would limit access for those unable to obtain marijuana through the state's medical program, while supporters cited concerns about the lack of federal oversight. The veto preserves the legal access to THC products in Texas, which offers a similar high to marijuana, despite the state's strict marijuana laws.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's decision to strike key Iranian nuclear sites, Doug Schoen draws parallels to his experience advising the State Department on Serbia, suggesting that the Iranian regime may be weaker than it appears. He argues that despite potential nationalist sentiment, widespread anger over economic issues and a desire for change among Iran's youth could lead to regime change. Schoen highlights previous protest movements and the regime's oppressive laws as indicators of underlying opposition, supporting the idea that Israel's actions could provide an opportunity for Iranians to rise up against the government. He acknowledges the risks of encouraging regime change but believes the Iranian government is vulnerable and that history provides a guide. </p>

The article warns that forgoing such an efficient settlement tool could mean missing a golden opportunity for the yuan, and that Stablecoins reduce the capital and time costs making cross-border transactions more convenient.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's strike on Iran signals a shift from a showman to a strongman, marked by a disregard for public opinion and contempt for Congress. The author highlights other authoritarian actions, including a crackdown on immigration and the deployment of troops against protesters, arguing that Trump's actions are consistent with a war on democracy. While Democrats have criticized the strike as a violation of the constitution, Republicans have largely supported the action, raising concerns about the potential for further escalation. The analysis concludes that Trump's deployment of troops and bombs is more dangerous than his previous displays of military might.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to streamline the prior authorization process, a move intended to reduce care delays and administrative burdens for patients and providers. Dozens of plans under insurers like CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna have committed to implementing changes across markets, including establishing a common standard for electronic submissions by 2027. The goal is to have at least 80% of electronic prior authorization approvals answered in real-time and to reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026. The move is expected to benefit 257 million Americans and builds on previous efforts to simplify the process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to reshape the civil service by making it easier to fire federal workers, raising concerns about the politicization of government jobs. A proposed rule would allow the administration to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants into a new category of employees who serve at the pleasure of the president, potentially stripping them of job protections. Critics warn this could lead to a focus on loyalty over expertise and undermine the independence of government agencies, including those responsible for collecting and reporting economic data. The administration argues these changes are necessary to ensure that federal employees are carrying out the president's agenda.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced a surge in early trading due to its safe-haven status after U.S. military strikes on Iran, but analysts warn these gains may be temporary. While the dollar index initially rose, a growing consensus suggests that concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and weakening international demand for U.S. assets will regain focus. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil transit waterway, is driving immediate safe-haven demand, but analysts caution that Iran has asymmetric capabilities to disrupt oil supplies without a full closure. The U.S. Treasury market's muted reaction suggests underlying concerns about the U.S. economy and trade policies are overshadowing the immediate crisis.</p>

          <p>Amidst the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, speculation about regime change in Tehran is increasing, but experts caution against foreign-imposed regime change due to its historical consequences. Foreign-imposed “regime change” is a highly controversial concept. Under international law, it is a clear violation of the sovereignty of the affected state. Often, the move is not democratically legitimized, and it frequently leads to a power vacuum or violence and instability. The article highlights the disastrous outcomes of attempted regime changes in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, emphasizing the need for ground forces and a strong rebel movement within Iran for any successful change of government. While Trump has sent mixed signals, the analysis suggests that aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to lead to regime change in Iran.</p>
