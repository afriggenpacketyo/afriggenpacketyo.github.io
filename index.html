          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in an extraordinary qualifying session marked by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours due to numerous crashes and interruptions, saw Verstappen outperform Williams' Carlos Sainz in the final moments. Championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will start from seventh and ninth respectively, following crashes and suboptimal laps amid challenging, rainy conditions. The chaotic nature of the session underscores the difficulty of the Baku street circuit.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving what his venue described as a "credible threat" on his life. The threat was reportedly made online before a performance in Ottawa, Canada, where police have since charged a 26-year-old man. The cancellations, affecting shows in Boston and Connecticut, were made out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the artist and his band. Morrissey, the former frontman of The Smiths, is scheduled to perform next in Philadelphia.</p>

This move has caused significant disruption, with major companies like Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Microsoft advising their visa-holding employees to remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel. The policy, which represents a major restriction on legal immigration, has also prompted foreign governments, particularly India, to assess the impact and express concern over potential humanitarian consequences for families.

The event, expected to draw over 100,000 people, has become a focal point for the national debate on political rhetoric, with lawmakers from both parties condemning violence but disagreeing on its causes. The aftermath of Kirk's assassination has also fueled media controversies, including criticism of the Emmys for not acknowledging the event and debates surrounding the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for his related commentary.</p>

The suspension has ignited a widespread debate on free speech and "cancel culture," drawing criticism and support from across the political spectrum, including from Hollywood figures and politicians.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., a resident of Leicester, North Carolina, has found a creative way to rebuild. John Saunby is constructing his dream home almost entirely from salvaged materials and rubble left in the storm's wake, including porch posts and kitchen floorboards he recovered from the wilderness. This project represents a personal "last hurrah" in home-building for Saunby, who is turning discarded items destined for a landfill into a unique and soulful house with the help of his partner, musician Jenny Kimmel.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has advanced to its seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries in her return from a concussion. Despite a resilient French side that kept the contest close, particularly in the first half, England's power and depth proved decisive in the second half. The Red Roses will now face Canada in a sold-out final at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next Saturday.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of airport check-in and baggage software, has caused significant disruptions at several European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin-Brandenburg.

While the company is working to resolve the issue, the attack highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to digital threats. British Airways was reportedly unaffected due to a back-up system, but most other airlines at Heathrow faced issues.</p>

          <p>A new opinion piece argues that Apple's latest product, the thinner iPhone Air, is an emblem of a broader, uninspired trend towards minimalism in technology, design, and culture. The author contends that while technology used to be bold and even clunky, it now values a spartan, unobtrusive aesthetic that mirrors a "miserable minimalist era" seen in everything from interior design to theater. The article suggests this trend toward stark simplicity is a form of control, creating a clean facade that masks a chaotic and uncontrolled world, ultimately leaving people feeling hollow and disconnected.</p>

Religious leaders like Sean Feucht have called for followers to become "more bold" in response, suggesting "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church." This narrative aligns with Kirk's own political evolution from a secular conservative activist to an advocate for a Christian culture war against leftism.

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and have returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar following negotiations. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their detention. The family had previously expressed grave concerns about the couple's health while in custody.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, exercising new "golden share" rights for the first time. These rights were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon, giving the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After the company informed nearly 800 workers of a planned shutdown, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly warned the CEO the administration would not allow it, leading U.S. Steel to reverse its decision.

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being the center of a 1998 political scandal to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She discussed the crucial decision to reclaim her own narrative, starting with a 2014 essay, and how younger generations helped shift public perception by questioning the power dynamics of her situation. Lewinsky spoke about the importance of empathy, the changing language around consent and harassment, and her work in helping other women, like Amanda Knox, tell their stories. She emphasized that one can survive unimaginable public shame and insist on a different ending.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has been described by both sides as productive and constructive, raising hopes for increased stability in their bilateral relationship. The leaders discussed trade frictions and a deal on TikTok, and also announced plans to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea. Trump also indicated he plans to visit China early next year. Despite the positive tone, analysts remain cautious, pointing to ongoing friction over issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea, as well as potential U.S. tariff threats.</p>

          <p>The United States has seemingly adopted a less public approach to sailing its warships through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. While such transits were regularly announced under the previous administration to signal freedom of navigation, there have been only three known operations this year, confirmed by the U.S. only after media inquiries. Beijing has historically complained about the "public hype" surrounding these operations. Some Chinese observers suggest this shift is a tactical change rather than a substantive alteration of U.S. policy in the region.</p>

          <p>A leading dermatologist is advising that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur even while sitting indoors near a window. Dr. Adam Friedman explains that while windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays. These UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, contributing to accelerated aging and skin cancer, and can affect people without their knowledge since they don't cause a burning sensation. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially if spending extended time near windows.</p>

The deal allows the UK to return a migrant who crosses the Channel in exchange for accepting another migrant from France who has a strong case for asylum.

          <p>American consumers are facing rising grocery bills, with food prices increasing at their fastest monthly rate since 2022. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three primary factors are responsible for this inflation. These include the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods like coffee, the effects of climate change shifting agricultural production, and a domestic shortage of farm labor. As companies face higher costs from these pressures, they are passing them on to consumers through direct price hikes or "shrinkflation," where package sizes are reduced for the same price.

          <p>In a counterintuitive market reaction, long-term interest rates, which influence mortgages and auto loans, increased this week even after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark short-term lending rate. Bond traders reportedly viewed the widely anticipated cut as an opportunity to "sell the news," driving bond prices down and their yields up. Some analysts believe this reflects concern that the Fed may be easing its focus on inflation while the economy remains steady. The move has already impacted the housing market, with mortgage rates ticking up from a three-year low. (not investment advice)</p>
