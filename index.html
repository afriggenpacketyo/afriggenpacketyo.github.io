          <p>In a strategic display of military power, the United States positioned two B-2 stealth bombers at an Alaskan air base just before President Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. These long-range aircraft, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads, were part of a flyover that also included F-35 and F-22 fighter jets as the leaders met. The move is widely interpreted as a deliberate show of force intended to underscore American military strength during the high-stakes diplomatic negotiations regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to hold a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting, held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, a promise he made during his presidential campaign. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will not be in attendance, he is expected to be briefed afterward, though he has stated that any agreement made without Ukraine's involvement would be considered a "dead decision."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A technology analyst has asserted that U.S. government intervention in the struggling chipmaker Intel is "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering acquiring a stake in the company. The argument suggests that such a move would be critical to revitalizing Intel and reducing America's reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This discussion aligns with the administration's goal of increasing domestic production of high-end technology, with funds from the CHIPS Act potentially being used for the investment.

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped 14% after the company issued a weak financial forecast, attributing the downturn to demand pressures in China. The company projected lower-than-expected earnings and revenue, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and trade issues that have reduced visibility into its China-based business. Analysts noted that after a period of rapid expansion, Chinese clients are now reducing their spending on equipment, creating headwinds that may persist and affect the company's stock performance.

          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally named Kisean Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for his involvement in a $1 million fraud scheme. The artist and his mother, Janice Turner, were convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud after orchestrating a plan to obtain luxury goods without payment. Prosecutors presented evidence that the pair used fake wire transfer receipts to deceive vendors, acquiring items such as a luxury SUV, jewelry, and electronics. Kingston's mother was previously sentenced to five years for her role in the scheme.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to place the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The lawsuit calls the action an "unlawful" and "hostile takeover" that infringes upon the district's right to self-governance. This legal challenge follows President Trump's executive order invoking emergency powers to assume command of the police force, a move the White House defends as necessary to address what it describes as a crime crisis in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Recent monsoon storms have delivered much-needed rain to parts of the Phoenix metropolitan area, though the distribution has been uneven. Areas like north Scottsdale and Queen Creek received substantial downpours of up to two inches, providing temporary relief from the heat. However, other parts of the region, including central Phoenix and the West Valley, experienced little to no rainfall. Meteorologists indicate there is still a chance for more scattered thunderstorms, but the main weather system is expected to move out of the area soon.</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Drake as "farcical" and "ridiculous." Drake's suit alleges that UMG, the parent company for both his and Kendrick Lamar's labels, defamed him by promoting Lamar's hit diss track "Not Like Us" at the expense of his own career. Grainge stated that the accusation is nonsensical, given that UMG has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Drake's career, including purchasing his recording catalog and publishing rights.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," written and directed by Zach Cregger, is being hailed for its daring and satisfying ending that provides clear answers to its central mystery. The movie follows a community grappling with the unexplained disappearance of a third-grade class, eventually revealing a supernatural villain behind the events. The review praises the film for delivering a cathartic climax where the villain is defeated, but also for underscoring the lasting trauma of the tragedy, reminding viewers that vanquishing evil does not erase the suffering it has already caused.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the Tax Foundation reveals that the tax breaks from President Trump's recent legislation will provide varying levels of financial benefit depending on where taxpayers live. In 2026, the average individual tax saving is projected to be $3,752, with residents in states like Wyoming and Washington seeing the largest cuts, while those in Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest. The report notes that high-income earners in affluent areas, such as resort towns, significantly skew the average savings upward. (not investment advice)</p>

While the city did experience a crime spike in 2023, official data from the Metropolitan Police Department and other sources show a significant decrease in violent crime and homicides in 2024 and 2025. The article points out that comparing D.C.'s crime rate to that of states is an inapt comparison, and that when compared to other major cities, D.C. does not have the highest murder rate.</p>
