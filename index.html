          <h2>US Aviation Regulator Affirms Safety of Boeing Fuel Switches Amid Air India Crash Probe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 06:05:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US aviation regulator, FAA, has affirmed the safety of fuel control switches in Boeing aircraft, despite their alleged role in a fatal Air India crash that claimed 260 lives. A preliminary report by Indian investigators highlighted that fuel to the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner engines was cut off post-takeoff, noting a 2018 FAA advisory for switch inspections that Air India had not mandated. Air India's CEO cautions against premature conclusions, emphasizing the ongoing investigation has found no mechanical or maintenance issues with the aircraft. This article details the conflicting perspectives and the FAA's stance, alongside South Korea's move to order inspections for its airlines, adding a new layer to the safety debate.</p>

          <p>Following the expiration of April's 'reciprocal tariffs,' former President Trump has initiated new tariff rates targeting 25 diverse economies, including long-time allies and neighboring countries. These measures, with negotiations set to conclude by August 1, are reportedly designed to finance his ambitious 'One Big Beautiful Bill.' The article highlights specific countries like Canada, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, which face substantial tariffs. This broad application of trade protectionism underscores a significant shift in global economic policy, impacting various international trade relationships and potentially altering economic dynamics and supply chains worldwide.

          <p>Scientists are undertaking a rescue mission in North Carolina's Hickory Nut Gorge, a region devastated by Hurricane Helene, to save the endangered Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander. This unique amphibian, found only in this valley, saw its population drastically reduced by the hurricane's flooding and landslides, which destroyed up to 30% of its critical, moist, shaded habitat. Researchers are collecting individuals for a captive breeding program at the North Carolina Zoo, aiming to establish a backup population as an insurance policy against extinction. This urgent effort highlights the severe impact of extreme weather events on vulnerable species and the critical role of conservation in a changing climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite nearly every U.S. county experiencing flooding in recent decades, only 4% of homeowners nationwide possess flood insurance, creating a significant 'flood insurance gap.' Most standard homeowner policies exclude flood damage, and federal aid often covers only a fraction of costs, leaving many vulnerable. The article highlights that federal flood insurance, primarily through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, is becoming increasingly unaffordable due to new pricing models based on individual property risk. This situation forces many to 'roll the dice,' leading to severe financial hardship when floods occur, and underscores the growing challenge posed by climate change-fueled intense rainfall.</p>

          <p>Raging wildfires near the Grand Canyon in Arizona have destroyed numerous structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, which was the only accommodation available on the park's North Rim. The Dragon Bravo Fire and White Sage Fire have consumed tens of thousands of acres, leading to the closure of the North Rim for the entire 2025 tourist season. Authorities are still working to contain the blazes, believed to be lightning-induced, which have also forced firefighter evacuations due to a chlorine leak at a nearby facility. This significant loss impacts a popular tourist destination and highlights the destructive power of natural disasters on both natural and built environments.</p>

          <p>This article defines Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), primarily methane, and critically examines its classification as 'green' energy by some US states and the EU, particularly in the context of transitioning from coal. Despite claims of a lower carbon footprint than coal, critics argue that LNG's supply chain is energy-intensive and prone to methane leaks, a potent greenhouse gas. A 2024 study suggests LNG has a larger greenhouse gas footprint than coal over 20 years. The article concludes that given its significant climate impact and higher cost compared to renewables, LNG has no viable role in a clean energy future. (not investment advice)</p>

While a brief rise in temperatures is expected later in the week, a new report highlights that the UK is increasingly breaking temperature and rainfall records, attributing this trend to climate change.

          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has approved Synopsys' acquisition of Ansys, a computer-aided engineering software vendor, following the US lifting its export curbs on EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software. The approval comes with specific conditions, requiring both firms to honor contractual obligations to Chinese clients and not terminate or refuse contract renewals. This decision reflects the critical importance of EDA technology to China's semiconductor industry and signals a potential easing of bilateral tensions in the ongoing tech war between the US and China, fostering a more predictable business environment for these key technologies.</p>

This initiative differs from the 2015 'supply-side structural reform' due to a changed economic landscape, including the prominence of private firms, weaker growth, and limited fiscal space.
