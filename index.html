          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries supports Elon Musk's description of President Trump's domestic policy bill as a "disgusting abomination," citing the bill's cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance. Jeffries criticizes the bill for taking healthcare from millions and cutting food programs for vulnerable populations to provide tax breaks for billionaires. Musk's criticism focuses on the bill's high cost, differing from Jeffries' focus on program cuts, but both oppose the legislation. Jeffries also highlights the "Republican civil war" as different factions within the GOP attack each other over the bill. The Democratic leader sees common ground with Musk in opposing the bill's impact on everyday Americans. The situation shows the widening gap between different factions within the government. The optimism score is related to the potential for bipartisan cooperation in addressing fiscal policy. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries and partial restrictions on seven others, citing national security risks. The full ban affects Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions are placed on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The White House spokeswoman said the ban is meant to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors through country-specific restrictions based on vetting, visa overstay rates, and information sharing. Exceptions are made for lawful permanent residents, adoptions, dual nationals, diplomatic travelers, athletes, and certain visa categories. The new travel ban announcement follows an attack in Boulder, Colorado. The restrictions reflect the administration's focus on border security and immigration control.</p>

The program identifies travelers who could present an elevated risk to aviation security using various data points. Quiet Skies has faced criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties. The decision to end the program follows reports that the husband of a U.S. Senator was placed on the watchlist.

          <p>Denmark has become a pioneer in restrictive migration policies, driven by the center-left Social Democrats. The country's shift towards stricter immigration laws began after the 2015 European migration crisis, fueled by concerns about social cohesion and welfare. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's government has implemented measures such as processing asylum seekers outside the continent and making refugees' stay temporary. While asylum applications have decreased, critics argue that these policies have damaged Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law.

          <p>President Trump met with Senate Finance Committee Republicans at the White House to shore up support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act". Senate Republicans are working to modify the bill, but the path forward remains unclear before Trump's July 4th deadline. Elon Musk's online criticism of the bill has added complexity to the situation, providing political cover for some Republicans with concerns. The bill faces opposition from both fiscal conservatives and those seeking different priorities. The President is working to sway senators who have concerns about the bill. </p>

          <p>Confidence in higher education has declined sharply, particularly among Republicans, with many questioning the value of a four-year college degree. Recent graduates face challenges in finding jobs, with unemployment rates at their highest since July 2021. The earnings gap between college graduates and high-school graduates has remained consistent since 2010. A study found that the relative value of college for lower-income students has declined since the 1960s. These doubts may also have a basis in Americans’ lack of faith in institutions, and in one another.</p>
