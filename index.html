          <p>A large wildfire, named the Jones Road Wildfire, has consumed over 13,250 acres in Ocean County, New Jersey, and is approximately 50% contained. The fire led to the evacuation of around 5,000 residents, but no single-family homes were damaged, and no injuries or loss of life have been reported. Acting Governor Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency for Ocean County, and the Garden State Parkway and Route 9 have been reopened. Fire officials attribute the rapid spread of the fire to dry conditions and expect the acreage to increase as they continue to work towards full containment.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, has issued a warning about the significant risk to patients posed by exhausted and fatigued hospital staff. The report highlights that medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention, and disrespectful behavior are common problems associated with staff fatigue. The watchdog cited examples of mistakes with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs, attributing these errors to long working hours, lack of breaks, and staffing pressures. The report urges the government and NHS England to implement better systems for monitoring fatigue and raising awareness about the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Water UK, the industry body, has acknowledged that the current system of self-monitoring sewage pollution levels by water companies is damaging public trust. They are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system to enhance transparency and accountability. This recommendation is part of a submission to the UK government's independent review into the water sector. The industry's proposal comes amid concerns that self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution from being revealed and criticism that regulators have not adequately held companies accountable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted for the first time in four years, primarily due to a significant drop in construction activity. The economic downturn has been exacerbated by prolonged political uncertainty, including the impeachment trials of former president Yoon Suk Yeol and prime minister Han Duck-soo, and trade war turmoil. While U.S. President Donald Trump temporarily suspended blanket tariffs, South Korea still faces tariffs on steel and automobiles, key exports to the U.S.</p>
