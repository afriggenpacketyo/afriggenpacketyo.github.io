          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 13-7 victory over the San Francisco Giants, overcoming an early deficit and a shaky start from pitcher Clayton Kershaw. After struggling with capitalizing on scoring opportunities for weeks, the team's offense exploded with six runs in the fifth inning, turning the game around. This crucial win, marked by key hits and improved bullpen performance, helps ease concerns about their recent inconsistent play and maintains their lead in the National League West standings.</p>

          <p>The unveiling of the mega-superyacht "Luminance," owned by Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov, has reignited intense debate over global wealth inequality and the environmental toll of the ultra-wealthy. Costing $500 million and producing as much planet-heating pollution as an average person in 860 years, the vessel highlights extreme disparities, especially as Akhmetov's fellow Ukrainians endure immense suffering. Commenters expressed dismay, calling it a symbol of a "broken humanity" where a few accumulate vast riches while the majority struggle.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a pilot program to fast-track the development and use of electric air taxis, or eVTOL aircraft, aiming to establish U.S. leadership in advanced airspace technology. The Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will create new regulatory frameworks and partner with private companies and local governments. This three-year program will include at least five pilot projects, testing both piloted and unmanned operations for cargo, supplies, and emergency transport, potentially allowing pre-certification flights.</p>

          <p>Following a historic drought that severely impacted vessel transits, the Panama Canal Authority is investing in major infrastructure to mitigate future water shortages. This includes a land bridge with a flagship natural gas pipeline to transport natural gas liquids, and the construction of the Rio Indo dam to supplement Lake Gatun's water supply. While the dam won't be completed until 2032 and requires relocating 2,500 residents, these projects aim to enhance reliability and attract more LNG transits, crucial for global trade and the US economy.</p>

          <h2>Unlimited Contactless Cards May Spur Impulse Spending and Debt, Experts Warn</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Academics caution that increasing or removing the limit on contactless card payments could lead to a rise in spontaneous spending and debt, as the current £100 PIN requirement acts as a crucial "friction point." The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks to set their own limits or remove them entirely, aligning with digital wallet practices that already have no limits. While offering convenience, concerns remain about consumer overspending, security risks, and the potential for economic abuse, particularly as many lack the digital skills to set personal limits.

          <p>Donald Trump is set for an unprecedented second state visit to the UK, designed to ensure a strong bilateral relationship with the US, according to diplomatic insiders. The visit, featuring royal pageantry and a stay at Windsor Castle, is seen as a strategic move to keep the unpredictable President "on side" and protect British interests, including trade and defense. Despite planned protests and underlying controversies like the Epstein scandal, the UK government believes getting in early during Trump's second term is a valuable investment, aiming for positive photo opportunities over policy breakthroughs.</p>
