            <p>Asian-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors analyzed Japan's inflation data, which showed a 3.6% year-on-year increase in March, exceeding the Bank of Japan's target for the third consecutive year.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>New research suggests that the treasure ship fleets of explorer Zheng He during China's Ming dynasty may have played a role in the global spread of brown rats. Ancient silk paintings dating to the Ming dynasty have provided new clues about the domestication of brown rats, indicating that they could have been transported around the world on Zheng He's ships. These paintings are the earliest evidence of brown rat domestication, predating known records in Japan by over two centuries. Brown rats, which are now widespread globally, are believed to have originated in northern China and Mongolia.</p>

            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China has missed several key targets in its "Made in China 2025" plan, designed to achieve self-sufficiency in technology. While China has exceeded targets in the automotive sector, it has not yet reached its goals in aerospace, high-end robotics, and manufacturing value-added growth. The plan has also contributed to overcapacity and unhealthy competition, exacerbating global trade tensions. Despite not meeting all targets, China has significantly increased its share of global manufacturing value add, raising concerns about security risks and market distortions.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García in El Salvador, a man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, despite a court order protecting him from deportation. The meeting occurred after Van Hollen was initially denied access to the prison where Ábrego García is being held. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele mocked the situation, stating that Ábrego García would remain in El Salvador's custody. The White House criticized Van Hollen's visit, accusing him of prioritizing the welfare of an illegal alien, while Ábrego García's lawyers maintain he has no gang affiliation.</p>

            <p>Ukraine has announced the signing of an outline for a minerals deal with the US, paving the way for an economic partnership agreement. The deal aims to grant the US access to Ukraine's critical minerals, oil, and gas resources. The signing follows a period of negotiation that was temporarily disrupted by a public dispute between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The final agreement is expected to include an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine, managed jointly by Kyiv and Washington.</p>

            <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, has been delayed until May after a contentious day in court. Attorneys for the brothers and prosecutors clashed, leading the judge to postpone the hearing to weigh requests from both sides. The hearing was intended to determine whether the brothers, serving life without parole, should receive a new sentence that could allow for their release. The delay stems from a new report assessing the potential risk the brothers pose to the public if released and a motion to recuse the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office from the case.</p>

            <p>Michigan is reporting its first measles outbreak since 2019, with three cases confirmed in Montcalm County. This outbreak is occurring amidst a national rise in measles cases, with over 700 cases reported in at least 24 states. Health officials are urging unvaccinated individuals to receive the MMR vaccine, which is highly effective in preventing measles. The CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine, with one dose being 93% effective and two doses being 97% effective.</p>

            <p>A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast. The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change. There's broad consensus amongst climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming. But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.</p>
