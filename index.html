        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's surprising victory over Andrew Cuomo in New York City's mayoral Democratic primary is being analyzed as a significant political shift, largely credited to the grassroots Palestinian protest movement. The article suggests that Mamdani's unapologetic support for Palestinian liberation, once considered a political liability, resonated with a changing Democratic electorate, particularly younger voters. His campaign successfully mobilized organizers and activists from groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine. This win is seen as a sign that Palestine has become a central issue in domestic American politics.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ advocates argue the Trump administration is employing a "divide and conquer" strategy by specifically targeting the transgender community through various bans and policy changes. This approach, detailed in the conservative Project 2025 agenda, aims to sow division within the broader LGBTQ community, eroding hard-won rights. While some conservative gay groups defend the administration, critics point to actions like removing LGBTQ resources and restricting gender markers on official documents as evidence of a systematic rollback of protections. The policies have faced legal challenges, but their implementation has already had significant consequences for the community.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli covert operations, including assassinations and sabotage against Iran, are causing alarm among security analysts in Taiwan. They fear that Beijing could replicate these high-stakes intelligence and infiltration tactics to undermine Taiwanese defenses and political systems. Experts highlight Taiwan's vulnerability due to its proximity to mainland China and extensive cross-strait cultural exchanges, which could facilitate Chinese intelligence recruitment and operations. The concern is that Beijing is laying the groundwork for a similar style of covert warfare against the island.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is being interpreted as a potential harbinger of a "Tea Party" style populist revolt within the Democratic Party. The article points to widespread voter dissatisfaction with the party's establishment leadership and a desire for more aggressive, confrontational politics and generational change. Polling data indicates that Democratic voters, especially younger ones, feel leaders are out of touch with their economic concerns. This anti-establishment energy could lead to more primary challenges against incumbents, forcing a leftward shift in the party's priorities and tactics.</p>

The event was marked by defiant chants against the U.S. and Israel, with attendees expressing anger over the conflict.

Many of these individuals were born and raised in Pakistan or Iran and are now returning to an Afghanistan where millions require aid, and funding for relief organizations has been severely cut.

This dynamic pushes other vital stories, such as gun violence, off the news cycle, even when they involve significant events like the shooting of elected officials. The piece reflects on the historical tendency of the press to be drawn to war, a phenomenon that can frustrate efforts to address pressing domestic problems.</p>

Billionaire hedge fund managers and business leaders have expressed grave concerns, with some threatening to move their businesses out of the city, fearing his policies will harm the economy. The backlash highlights a class warfare dynamic, as Wall Street's preferred candidate, Andrew Cuomo, was defeated despite receiving millions in campaign funding from the finance industry.

          <p>Recent news from Japan includes ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States ahead of a July deadline, with Japan's auto industry remaining a key point of contention. In other developments, the European Union has proposed international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move Japan opposes. The chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee is also planning to visit the atomic-bombed cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in July. Additionally, a study suggests a traditional Japanese diet may help fight depression, and a new giant slide was closed after several injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation by the environmental nonprofit Earthsight has linked major luxury fashion brands, including Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss, to illegal deforestation in Brazil. The report traces leather back from Italian tanneries to Brazilian suppliers who allegedly source cattle from illegally cleared land, including within Indigenous territories. This process often involves "cattle laundering," where animals from illegal farms are moved to legal ones before sale, masking their true origin. While most brands denied the specific allegations or cited traceability efforts, the findings highlight significant flaws in supply chain oversight and certification systems.</p>

          <p>State and local health departments across the U.S. are facing a crisis as grant funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is months late without explanation. This has forced some departments to lay off staff and halt essential public health services, including HIV testing and contact tracing. According to CDC insiders, the agency has not received its full fiscal year funding and is operating on short-term increments, preventing it from distributing the grants that local departments depend on. This "rescission by inertia" threatens to grind public health work to a halt.</p>

The article alleges these areas have become "killing fields," a claim supported by aid groups like Doctors Without Borders, who report treating numerous patients shot near these locations.

          <p>In a historic reversal of its post-World War II military posture, Germany is embarking on a plan to build the largest and strongest armed forces in Europe. Spurred by a new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced a commitment to spend 3.5% of GDP on defense, a dramatic increase funded by a special constitutional change. This major policy shift aims to meet and exceed NATO spending targets, transforming Germany's role in European security. The move reflects a new sense of urgency and a recognition that its partners expect Germany to take on a greater defense burden.</p>

Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return to China by next February.

          <p>Despite being a deep-red state that overwhelmingly supports Donald Trump, Kentucky has become a rare center of high-profile Republican opposition to the president. Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with Representative Thomas Massie, have frequently criticized and voted against Trump's agenda on issues ranging from foreign policy and tariffs to his major spending bill. This defiance has angered Trump's base in the state and prompted the president to call for a primary challenge against Massie. The dynamic showcases a unique political landscape where influential GOP lawmakers are unafraid to buck their party's leader.</p>

The lawsuits allege that a high-voltage transmission line is improperly grounded, causing fires to ignite at the base of transmission towers. While Edison has acknowledged its equipment may be linked to the 2025 fire, it denies fault for the 2019 blaze, which destroyed over 100 structures.

          <p>California is leveraging the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, a law born from the bloody aftermath of the Civil War, in its legal battle to rein in President Trump's deployment of troops in Los Angeles. The act forbids the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, and a federal judge has allowed the state to gather evidence on whether troops' actions in immigration enforcement violate it. The law was originally passed to end Reconstruction and enabled the rise of the Jim Crow era by preventing federal troops from protecting Black voters.

The case, which haunted his lawyer Johnnie Cochran, was built on the testimony of a police informant whose role was hidden by prosecutors and the FBI for decades. Pratt's conviction was eventually overturned in 1997 after evidence of a frame-up, part of the FBI's COINTELPRO program to neutralize Black leaders, came to light. The story reveals a "twilight zone of deceit" and official corruption used to imprison a man seen as a threat to the establishment.</p>
