          <p>Humberto has intensified into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and is projected to become a major hurricane over the weekend. As of Friday morning, the storm posed no immediate threat to the United States coastline, and no coastal watches or warnings were in effect. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring a second weather system in the northeast Caribbean, which could develop into a tropical depression and bring heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. This makes Humberto the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new set of tariffs, including a 100% levy on certain imported drugs from companies without U.S. factories, a 25% tax on heavy-duty trucks, and a 50% tax on kitchen and bathroom cabinets. The stated goal is to protect American manufacturers from a "flooding" of foreign products. Economists and trade officials note that exemptions for generic drugs and for companies investing in U.S. production may lessen the impact. Major pharmaceutical firms like GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have already made significant investment commitments in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A London court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a rapper from the group Kneecap known as Mo Chara. He was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, but the chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because it was not brought within the required six-month time limit. Following the ruling, which was met with applause in the courtroom, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence pro-Palestinian voices. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently reviewing the decision and may consider an appeal.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he fatally stabbed in the neck while she slept. Elliott, who was 17 at the time, called 911 immediately after, claiming he thought he was dreaming and has maintained he was sleepwalking. The defense presented evidence of a family history of sleepwalking and an expert neurologist who concluded the act was unintentional and occurred during a sleepwalking episode. Prosecutors are proceeding with the murder charge, questioning his account and citing the nature of the wounds, leaving the family facing a devastating legal battle.</p>

          <p>Moldova is holding a crucial parliamentary election that will determine its geopolitical direction, either continuing its path toward the European Union or shifting back toward Russian influence. Pro-European President Maia Sandu's party is facing a strong challenge from pro-Russian alliances, which are using social media platforms like TikTok to spread disinformation and anti-Western narratives. Russia is accused of actively trying to sway the election through widespread vote-buying schemes and propaganda, aiming to destabilize the country and halt its EU integration. The outcome is highly uncertain, with nearly half of the voters still undecided.</p>

          <p>A violent clash between rival drug gangs at a prison in Esmeraldas, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of at least 17 inmates, with some victims being decapitated. This marks the second deadly prison riot in the country within a few days, highlighting the extreme violence plaguing Ecuador's penitentiary system, where around 500 inmates have been killed since 2021. The prisons have become battlegrounds for gangs like Los Choneros and Los Lobos, which have ties to international cartels. The government's state of "internal armed conflict" has struggled to contain the bloodshed within the overcrowded and lawless facilities.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered dense and thriving marine ecosystems living on unexploded Nazi-era bombs at the bottom of Germany's Luebeck Bay in the Baltic Sea. An unmanned submersible captured footage of approximately 40,000 animals per square meter, including marine worms, crabs, and fish, covering the munitions. In a particularly surprising finding, researchers observed over 40 starfishes clustered directly on an exposed block of highly toxic TNT. The discovery highlights how marine life adapts to and utilizes man-made structures, even deadly ones, as hard surfaces for habitats in an otherwise sandy seafloor.</p>

          <p>A coordinated sting operation by Interpol across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running romance scams and "sextortion" schemes. The operation targeted criminal networks that use digital platforms to defraud victims, who lost a combined total of nearly $2.8 million. Authorities in countries like Ghana and Senegal seized hundreds of devices and identified over 1,400 victims. The crackdown highlights the sharp rise in digital-enabled crime in the region and represents a significant effort to disrupt the syndicates that exploit vulnerable individuals online for financial gain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is heading towards another shutdown due to a political standoff between Senate Democrats and President Trump. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are refusing to approve funding without key concessions, while the Trump administration appears to view a shutdown as a point of leverage rather than a crisis. This dynamic makes a shutdown seem inevitable, as neither side is willing to back down. The contributor argues that while Democrats may feel a moral imperative to fight, the public ultimately suffers when the government cannot function, and the political blame game rarely results in a clear victory for either party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to external trade pressures, particularly from the United States, China has developed a range of policy measures to protect its domestic industries. Beyond traditional anti-dumping investigations, Beijing utilizes tools like the "Unreliable Entity List," which can restrict trade and investment with foreign firms deemed to harm China's national interests. Another key measure involves export controls on "dual-use" items, which are goods with both civilian and potential military applications. These mechanisms provide China with a flexible and powerful toolbox to retaliate against what it perceives as unfair trade practices or political encroachment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite campaign promises to lower energy prices, the Trump administration's policies are actively increasing electricity costs for Americans. The author points to several actions, including raising taxes on clean energy projects, blocking new wind and solar developments, and imposing tariffs that increase the cost of materials for all types of power generation. Furthermore, the administration's support for exporting natural gas reduces domestic supply, while its use of emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal plants open forces customers to subsidize them. The piece concludes these policies are sabotaging the clean energy transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert “Rabbit” Jaramillo, a founding member of the influential 1960s East L.A. band Cannibal and the Headhunters, has died at 78. The group was a key part of the Chicano rock scene and scored a national hit with "Land of 1,000 Dances." Their energetic performances earned them a spot opening for The Beatles on their 1965 U.S. tour, including two shows at the Hollywood Bowl. Jaramillo left the group shortly after to support his family, but he later reunited with his bandmates as interest in the Eastside sound was rekindled. As the last surviving original member, he served as a vital link to a pivotal moment in rock history.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's remarks linking Tylenol to autism, medical experts and researchers are clarifying the existing science on the matter. They emphasize that while some studies suggest a potential association, a causal link has not been established, and the risks of untreated fever during pregnancy—including birth defects and fetal death—are well-documented. Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, remains the safest over-the-counter option for treating fever and pain in pregnant individuals. Doctors and even the FDA recommend judicious use under medical guidance, but stress that avoiding the medication entirely when needed could pose greater harm.</p>

          <p>An analysis of federal data reveals that ICE is transferring detained immigrants between facilities more frequently and rapidly than in the previous year, a practice that sows fear and cuts them off from legal and family support. Immigrants are often moved across the country with little notice, making it difficult for attorneys to manage their cases and for families to stay connected. Advocacy groups argue these transfers are used as a retaliatory tactic and a deliberate strategy to isolate detainees, pushing them to self-deport. This system of constant movement makes mounting a legal defense significantly harder.</p>
