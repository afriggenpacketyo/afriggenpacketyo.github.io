          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing injuries and damage, prompting accusations of war crimes from Israeli leaders. Israeli Defense Minister Katz vowed to hold Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accountable, while Prime Minister Netanyahu promised a response. The missile attack wounded 271 people, including serious injuries, and targeted a high-rise building near Tel Aviv. Israel warns of a new threat of cluster bombs fired by Iran, urging caution and reporting of unexploded ordnance, while Israel has increased attacks on strategic targets in Iran and against government targets in Tehran.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that taxpayers will not fund President Trump's appeal in the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. The court denied Trump's request for Justice Department lawyers to represent him, relating to Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s. DOJ lawyers argued that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, warranting DOJ defense. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24, following a previous denial of his request to rehear a challenge to a $5 million civil judgment awarded to Carroll in 2023.</p>

The defense argued that Read was framed by law enforcement and others, presenting a complex narrative of events leading to O'Keefe's death. The case included scrutiny of evidence, allegations of a coverup, and dramatic courtroom battles over witness testimony and evidence.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are increasing the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, leading homeowners to reconsider upgrades. Suppliers have raised prices on lumber, steel, and aluminum due to the Trump administration's levies on trade partners. The National Association of Home Builders estimates a typical price increase of around $10,000 per home renovation project, urging homeowners to budget up to an additional 30% for tariff-related costs. Experts recommend prioritizing exterior repairs and working with suppliers to lock in prices when possible. (not investment advice)</p>

Beachgoers expressed concern over the incidents, as unprovoked shark attacks are rare but do occur. Researchers investigated 88 alleged shark-human interactions worldwide in 2024, confirming 71 incidents involved shark bites.</p>

The M23 militia, believed to be backed by Rwanda, is not a signatory to the agreement, raising concerns about its effectiveness.
