          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry announced it is no longer bound by the restrictions of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark deal officially expired. The agreement had capped Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief but has been in jeopardy since the US withdrawal in 2018. Despite expressing a commitment to diplomacy, Tehran has been accused of obstructing inspections and enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels, leading to stalled negotiations and the reinstatement of international sanctions.</p>

          <p>Organizers from anti-Israel movements are merging their efforts with the 'No Kings' protests planned across the United States. Groups like "UAW Labor for Palestine" are positioning their "Free Palestine" message within the broader anti-Trump demonstrations, linking it to domestic issues such as ICE and police actions. The article highlights how this strategic alignment brings together a network of nonprofits, labor unions, and political action committees, raising questions about the use of tax-exempt funds for partisan protest activities.</p>

          <p>The first T20 match between England and New Zealand in Christchurch was washed out by rain, preventing New Zealand from starting its chase. Before the weather interruption, England had posted a score of 153-6 on a challenging pitch. All-rounder Sam Curran was instrumental, scoring an unbeaten 49 from 35 balls to rescue England's innings after the team had fallen to 81-5, which may have been a competitive score.</p>

Organizers anticipate millions of demonstrators will participate, citing concerns over immigration detentions, environmental policy, and education cuts. In response, some Republican governors have mobilized their states' National Guards, while the White House has dismissed the event's significance, highlighting the deep political divisions in the country.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing widespread criticism for comments made during a press conference in Potsdam. When asked about immigration, Merz stated that despite a fall in refugee numbers, "we still have this problem in the cityscape," which is why the interior minister is working on large-scale deportations. Opposition politicians have condemned the remarks as "racist" and "discriminatory," demanding an apology for language that appears to link the presence of immigrants to urban problems and denies their sense of belonging.</p>

          <p>British triathlete Beth Potter is competing for her second world title in Australia, entering the final event tied for the lead with France's Cassandre Beaugrand. The 33-year-old Olympic bronze medallist revealed that she felt immense pressure during the 2024 Olympic year, which took a significant mental and physical toll. This season, with a new coaching setup and less self-imposed expectation, she has enjoyed her racing more and is motivated by the recent tragic death of a friend from her training group.</p>

          <p>After his father's death, Antony Easton discovered a suitcase revealing his family's hidden past as the Eisners, a wealthy Jewish family in pre-war Berlin whose fortune was stolen by the Nazis. The documents led him on a decade-long investigation, uncovering a multi-billion-pound steel empire, properties, and artworks lost through forced sales and betrayal by a non-Jewish associate. This journey has enabled him to begin reclaiming some of the family's looted art, including a painting from a Berlin museum, bringing a measure of justice and reconnecting him with his lost heritage.</p>
