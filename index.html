          <p>Liverpool has intensified its efforts to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi by submitting an improved bid of £35 million, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, requesting an additional £5 million in bonuses, and negotiations between the two football clubs are ongoing ahead of the transfer deadline. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a transfer likely as his current deal expires next summer. The potential move is also contingent on Crystal Palace successfully signing replacements for their defensive line.</p>

In a social media post, the 58-year-old chef shared a photo of a large bandage on his face and neck, clarifying it was not from a facelift. He thanked his medical team for promptly removing the cancerous growth, which is often caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

          <p>A Hamburg-based brewery, Astra, has collaborated with spice company Hela to create a unique beer named "Currydurst," which translates to "Currythirst." The limited-edition beverage infuses a classic Astra beer with the spicy and smoky flavors of Hela's famous curry ketchup, a key ingredient in Germany's beloved Currywurst sausage snack. This innovative creation pays homage to Hamburg's vibrant street food culture and the long-standing local tradition of pairing Currywurst with an Astra beer. Only 2,000 liters of this special brew will be produced, leaving its future as a cult classic uncertain.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, instructing him to return to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was made after fellow striker Liam Delap sustained a serious hamstring injury during a match, which could sideline him for up to eight weeks. This sudden reversal left Jackson reportedly angry and has thrown Chelsea's attacking options into disarray, leaving them with only one fit senior striker. The club is now re-evaluating its strategy just before the transfer deadline closes.</p>

          <p>During the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in Minneapolis, internal disagreements emerged, challenging the party's narrative of unity against the Republican agenda. DNC Chair Ken Martin called for a more aggressive stance against President Trump, stating the party can no longer afford to "bring a pencil to a knife fight." Tensions were particularly evident during a debate over two resolutions concerning the Israel-Hamas war, which exposed a significant divide between progressive members and the party leadership. Despite these fractures, leaders publicly emphasized the need to remain unified to counter the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal, a process for deporting migrants without a court hearing, ruling it unlawful. This decision curtails the administration's ability to detain and remove immigrants from the country's interior with limited due process. Separately, President Trump expressed doubts about a bilateral meeting between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia but suggested a trilateral meeting involving the U.S. "will happen." He also indicated openness to using U.S. aircraft in a security guarantee to help end the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Health officials in New York City have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since early August. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven fatalities. Investigations traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing frequency of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms within seconds. A large-scale study involving over 12,000 patients in London GP surgeries demonstrated that the device significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The technology analyzes subtle heart sounds and blood flow patterns that are undetectable by the human ear. Experts believe this innovation could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive timely treatment and improve long-term outcomes.</p>

The film pits its hero against a villainous pharmaceutical CEO, played by Kevin Bacon, giving the story a clearer environmental and anti-corporate message. While its polished production may seem at odds with the cheap, garish style of the original, the movie succeeds as a diverting and cleverly violent homage.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most trading partners are illegal, stating they represent an overreach of his emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump used to justify the levies, does not grant the president the authority to impose taxes or duties. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for a potential appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. This decision marks a significant legal setback for a cornerstone of Trump's economic agenda and creates uncertainty for global trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a comprehensive, two-year study linked Iowa's severe water pollution to its powerful agricultural industry, public officials have quietly eliminated the funding intended to promote the report's findings. The study, which cost $1 million, highlighted the connection between farm runoff and contaminants in drinking water sources for over 600,000 people, amid growing concerns about the state's high cancer rates. The remaining $400,000 in the budget, earmarked for public awareness campaigns, was reportedly "zeroed out" without explanation. Critics fear this move is an attempt by agricultural interests to suppress information crucial for public health and environmental reform.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could jeopardize the central bank's independence and harm the U.S. economy. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to higher inflation, a weaker dollar, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, the long-term consequences could be damaging for both consumers and corporate earnings.

The State Department confirmed the move, which also affects 80 other Palestinian officials, as a measure to hold the Palestinian Authority accountable for what it calls undermining peace prospects. The Palestinian leadership condemned the decision as a violation of U.S. obligations as the UN's host country and has called on international partners to pressure the Trump administration to reverse it.

          <p>President Donald Trump's uncharacteristically low public profile this week has fueled widespread speculation on social media regarding his whereabouts and health. The president has not been seen in public since a cabinet meeting on Tuesday and has no events scheduled for the Labor Day weekend. This absence comes after recent observations of bruising on his hands, which the White House previously attributed to a benign condition called chronic venous insufficiency. While Trump has been active on Truth Social, his lack of public appearances has prompted questions about who is currently running the country.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, after severe drought caused water levels to recede in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The tombs, likely from the Hellenistic period, were unearthed in the Khanke region of Duhok province. While the ongoing drought has devastated agriculture, it has provided a rare opportunity for excavation work in areas that are normally submerged. The archaeological team is now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the reservoir's water levels rise again.</p>

His attorneys successfully argued that his severe dementia renders him incompetent to be executed, as he cannot understand the reason for his punishment. The court has ordered a lower court to re-evaluate his mental fitness, acknowledging that while the delay causes suffering for the victim's family, it is bound by the rule of law. Menzies had chosen death by firing squad decades ago and would have been only the sixth U.S. prisoner executed by that method since 1977.</p>

The company's move to a minimalist logo and modernized interiors was decried as "woke," leading to a sharp drop in its stock price. Following a social media post from Trump criticizing the change, the company announced it would restore its classic "Old Country Store" branding. The incident is seen as another example of the significant influence the MAGA movement and right-wing online voices now wield over corporate America.</p>

          <p>For the first time, scientists at MIT have captured images of heat traveling as a wave, a phenomenon known as "second sound," through a superfluid quantum gas. Unlike in normal materials where heat dissipates, in this exotic, frictionless state, heat propagates back and forth without the fluid itself appearing to move. To visualize this, researchers developed a novel thermography technique using radio frequencies to track the temperature of lithium-6 atoms cooled to near absolute zero. This breakthrough could provide insights into the physics of high-temperature superconductors and the interiors of neutron stars.</p>

Nelson traveled for six years to 14 countries, capturing images that illustrate the paradox of our relationship with nature, from curated safari experiences to elephants chained underwater for tourist photos. The project highlights how zoos, theme parks, and even national parks create a choreographed version of the wild, which can reassure us that nature still exists while we continue to destroy it. Nelson's work serves as a commentary on what we have lost and how we create monuments to that loss.</p>
