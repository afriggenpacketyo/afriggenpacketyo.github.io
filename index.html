Betro, who disguised herself with a niqab, later returned to fire shots at the empty house before fleeing to the US.

          <p>Following a shooting at the NFL headquarters where the perpetrator requested his brain be studied for CTE, neuroscientist Chris Nowinski discusses the work of the Unite Brain Bank. Nowinski, a co-founder of the research center, explains the process of procuring and studying brains of former athletes to diagnose the neurodegenerative disease, which is linked to head trauma. He notes that while the NFL has made some rule changes, the issue has faded from public view due to a fractured media landscape and the league's influence. Nowinski expresses concern that CTE risk is not being adequately addressed at college and high school levels.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece highlights a concerning trend in the U.S., with kindergarten vaccination rates declining for the fifth consecutive year as vaccine exemptions reach a record high. The author attributes this to a political climate that undermines public health infrastructure, citing the current administration's cuts to CDC and NIH funding and the appointment of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary. This has coincided with the largest U.S. measles outbreak in three decades, with the author warning of a potential "doom loop of mistrust" and a lost generation of American scientific talent.</p>

Bowman, who previously worked for the Republican Liberty Caucus, also spread baseless election fraud theories and has been praised by right-wing influencer Laura Loomer.

          <p>Alibaba's instant commerce platform, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken its primary competitor, Meituan, in daily orders within China's on-demand delivery market. The shift occurred after Meituan ceased a promotional subsidy campaign, allowing Alibaba's heavily subsidized service to gain the top spot. Analysts from Morgan Stanley predict this signals a move from a "near-monopoly" for Meituan to a "near-duopoly," forecasting that both companies could hold nearly equal market shares by 2030. The competition highlights the effectiveness of aggressive subsidy strategies in China's highly competitive tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

This decline in popularity, even in his political stronghold of Tainan, signals potential difficulties for his ruling party in upcoming local elections and the 2028 presidential race.

Key signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, requiring immediate cooling and veterinary attention. To keep pets safe, owners should provide ample shade and water, use cooling mats, and never leave an animal in a locked vehicle.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, which have already experienced flooding, and is currently moving westward. Early models project Erin could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands, though it poses no immediate threat to the United States. This is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which is predicted by NOAA to be more active than normal this year.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn of a 'Hidden Epidemic' of Lung Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 07:24:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts suggest that lung cancer is a grossly undercounted and deadly "hidden epidemic" across sub-Saharan Africa, despite official statistics suggesting it is a minor issue. Pulmonologists argue that the lack of diagnostic resources means most cases are never identified, often being misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, which is prevalent in the region. Systemic issues like a lack of nerve endings in the lungs leading to late-stage symptoms, insufficient healthcare training, and poor death certification infrastructure contribute to the undercounting. As smoking rates rise, experts warn the problem will worsen without urgent investment in prevention, screening, and data collection.</p>

The FA sanctioned Coote for an "aggravated breach" of its rules due to a reference to Klopp's nationality in the clip, which was filmed in 2020 and leaked online in 2024. Coote, who was dismissed by the refereeing body PGMOL last year and has also been banned by UEFA for a separate incident, admitted the charge and expressed deep remorse.

          <p>Germany, while appearing liberal in some aspects, maintains a set of quirky and strictly enforced regulations, particularly concerning Sundays and public holidays. For instance, a "Tanzverbot," or dancing ban, is enforced in most states on Good Friday, with potential fines reaching €10,000 in regions like Bavaria. Other unusual rules include prohibitions on mowing lawns or using power tools on Sundays, a ban on building large sandcastles on certain erosion-prone beaches, and it even being an offense to run out of fuel on the Autobahn. These laws reflect a deep-seated tradition of "Ruhezeit" (quiet time) and public order.</p>

          <p>Workers and labor advocates in Missouri are expressing devastation and anger after the state's Republican-led legislature repealed a paid sick leave mandate that voters had approved with 58% of the vote. The law, which also included minimum wage increases, was overturned following an aggressive lobbying campaign by business groups. Workers who campaigned for the initiative shared personal stories of having to work while ill or lose income to care for sick family members, calling the repeal a "literal gut punch." Advocacy groups are now considering a new ballot initiative to enshrine the protections in the state's constitution.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that President Trump's decision to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force and deploy the National Guard is a political move that ignores data showing a sharp decrease in violent crime. Civil rights groups warn that this action, taken under the pretext of an emergency, is an "invitation for abuse" and could lead to increased police violence and harassment. The move complicates accountability, as D.C. felonies are prosecuted by a presidential appointee. Critics view the federal takeover as an overreach of power and part of a broader effort to disempower Black-led cities, calling for D.C. statehood as the only path to local control.</p>

          <p>A newly reissued photography book by Adrienne Salinger, titled "In My Room," offers a nostalgic glimpse into the private worlds of American teenagers during the 1980s and '90s. Salinger's work captures her subjects in their bedrooms, spaces that served as personal sanctuaries for constructing identity before the era of social media. The portraits reveal an inflection point between childhood and adolescence, with rooms decorated with a mix of stuffed animals, band posters, drug paraphernalia, and academic brochures. Through her process, Salinger not only documented these spaces but also allowed the teens to see their own lives in a new light.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that while President Trump's rhetoric about crime in Washington D.C. is exaggerated, he is correct that the city has a profound and long-standing violence problem. Although recent data shows a decline in homicides and carjackings from their pandemic-era peaks, the city's murder rate remains significantly higher than in other major cities like New York and is disproportionately concentrated in its poorest wards. The article suggests that a focused federal intervention targeting the specific people and places driving the violence could be effective, similar to a successful 2005 initiative, but a purely posturing approach would fail to address the city's real safety issues.</p>

          <p>India's headline consumer inflation rate fell to 1.55% in July, marking the ninth straight month of decline and its lowest level since June 2017. The continued easing, driven by a drop in food price growth, was below economists' expectations and comes after the Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady last week. The central bank has noted a more benign inflation outlook, which could provide room for a looser monetary policy to support the economy. However, analysts note the central bank remains cautious, and potential U.S. tariffs could impact future economic performance. (not investment advice)</p>
