          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 16:31:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a White House event with President Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk avoided answering a question from a Fox News reporter about a New York Times report alleging his drug use and family legal issues. Musk instead questioned the credibility of the New York Times, referencing a judge's ruling against the publication regarding reporting on Russia-gate. Musk previously led the DOGE government cost-cutting initiative for Trump since January. The incident occurred in the Oval Office with Trump present, underscoring the complex relationship between the tech mogul and the former president, as well as Musk's tendency to deflect potentially damaging inquiries. Optimism score is not included in this summary.</p>

Trump emphasized that Musk will still contribute to the White House's efforts, describing Musk's work with DOGE as his "baby." Musk's departure follows 130 days in the administration, the maximum allowable under his status as a "special government employee," during which he aimed to cut government spending and reduce the national debt, leading to controversy and protests. Despite his departure, Musk intends to continue seeking significant reductions in government spending.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at the age of 87 at her home in New York City. Swit's portrayal of Houlihan, a foil to Alan Alda's character, earned her two Emmy Awards and multiple Golden Globe nominations. "M*A*S*H," which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, was adapted from the 1970 film and maintained an anti-establishment ethos while exploring themes of war, humor, and the human condition. As the show progressed, Swit aimed to depict Houlihan as a complex and evolving character.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to recalled cucumbers has sickened dozens of people across 18 states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that at least 16 people have been hospitalized as a result of the outbreak. The recalled cucumbers, grown by Bedner Growers Inc., were distributed by Fresh Start Produce Inc. between April 29 and May 19. Health officials advise consumers to discard any cucumbers if they are unsure of their origin and to wash any surfaces that may have come into contact with the contaminated produce.</p>
