          <p>Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Denzel Perryman was arrested and jailed following a traffic stop where authorities discovered five firearms, including two assault-style rifles. The 32-year-old NFL veteran was cooperative but is being held without bond on felony charges, creating uncertainty for the team's defensive strategy. The Chargers organization has acknowledged the situation and is gathering information, while Perryman's agent stated they are working with legal counsel to address the matter appropriately. The arrest adds to a series of off-field legal issues involving NFL players.</p>

President Trump publicly rejected a potential deal with Senate Democrats aimed at confirming his nominees, urging Republicans to refuse the offer. Concurrently, the Office of Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into former prosecutor Jack Smith for potential Hatch Act violations related to his probes of Trump. Additionally, the recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner has drawn sharp condemnation from her predecessor, who warned it sets a dangerous precedent for politicizing federal data.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of a jobs report that showed slower hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump criticized the numbers as inaccurate and politically motivated, a claim that drew backlash from economists and some lawmakers who warned the move threatens the integrity of federal economic data. The dismissal highlights growing concerns about the politicization of nonpartisan government agencies responsible for producing critical economic indicators that influence markets and policy decisions.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has largely maintained restrictions on federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that agents cannot base detentions solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over "roving patrols" by ICE and CBP that advocates argued violated the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The decision was praised by immigrant rights groups as a crucial protection against racial profiling. The Trump administration criticized the ruling, stating that its enforcement actions target individuals based on their illegal status, not their ethnicity.</p>

This federal law restricts the political activities of government employees. The inquiry was prompted by a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions and push for a "rushed trial" before the election were politically motivated to harm Trump's candidacy. Smith, who resigned after the election, had previously maintained that his investigations were conducted without political influence.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly willing to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million, just two years after signing him. This development comes as the club maintains interest in RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko, whose potential arrival would marginalize Hojlund's role on the team. While Hojlund has publicly stated his desire to remain at Old Trafford, the club may need to sell players to comply with financial regulations. A sale at this price would represent a book loss for United, given his remaining contract amortization. (not investment advice)</p>

While wartime legend claimed the creature died from shell-shock during a U-boat encounter, newly analyzed records suggest a more mundane cause. Logbooks from the platypus's attendant show that as the ship crossed the equator, water and air temperatures in its enclosure soared well above the safe threshold for the species.

          <p>A large-scale manhunt involving local, state, and federal agencies is ongoing for Michael Paul Brown, the U.S. Army veteran accused of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities have located the suspect's abandoned truck and are focusing their search on a mountainous area west of the town. Brown's niece told reporters that he has struggled with significant mental health issues, suggesting his actions were not those of a man in his right mind. The incident has deeply shaken the small, tight-knit community, which is now on high alert.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offence, carrying a potential five-year prison sentence, for individuals who use the internet to advertise or facilitate illegal immigration. The measure, part of a broader crackdown on small boat crossings, aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt criminal gangs that use social media to promote their services. According to the Home Office, a vast majority of migrants arriving by boat report using social media during their journey. The plan is designed to target those selling false promises of safe passage and work in the UK.</p>

A Class II recall signifies a situation where exposure could cause temporary or medically reversible health consequences.

          <p>This retrospective article shares the stories of two survivors of the "Son of Sam" shooting spree, Robert Violante and Carl Denaro, whose lives were irrevocably changed in 1977. Violante was on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz when they were both shot; he was blinded, and she was killed. Denaro was shot months earlier and suffered a severe head wound that required a metal plate. Both men reflect on the random violence that derailed their young lives and their relief upon David Berkowitz's capture, providing a powerful, human perspective on the terror that gripped New York City.</p>

          <p>A global TikTok trend involving Labubu dolls has been exploited by criminals, flooding the market with dangerous counterfeit versions that pose a choking hazard to children. Trading Standards officers in the UK have seized thousands of the fake dolls, which easily fall apart, revealing small components that can be swallowed. The immense popularity of the authentic dolls, which are often sold out and resold at high prices, has created a lucrative market for the fakes. Authorities warn that these counterfeits are often made with cheap, potentially toxic materials and a complete disregard for safety standards.</p>

Shayna, who was only four when her father died, says visiting Berkowitz is her way of connecting with her father and understanding the story that so deeply marked his life.

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin harshly criticized his players' performance following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening league match. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he called a "mentality problem," accusing some players of having egos and reverting to type. He specifically called out the effort of two unnamed players who were substituted early in the second half. The public rebuke so early in the season has drawn significant attention, with pundits expressing surprise at the extreme nature of the manager's comments.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from the injured list, striking out eight batters over five innings in his first start since the beginning of the season. However, his performance was marred by two home runs from Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field porch at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite Snell giving up three runs in the 4-0 loss, his command and ability to generate swings and misses were promising signs for the Dodgers' rotation.
