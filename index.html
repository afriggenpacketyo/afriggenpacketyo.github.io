Housebuilders will be required to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports. Developers who repeatedly fail to meet targets could be denied future permissions or face penalties. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, addressing the housing crisis and helping people get on the housing ladder.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was wrongly deported to Mexico despite his fear of harm. The man, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the U.S. after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala, but was deported to Mexico instead. The judge found the deportation lacked due process, as the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, presenting evidence of being sexually assaulted and held for ransom in Mexico. The man is now living in hiding in Guatemala, fearing for his safety.</p>

The initiative aims to prevent food from falling into militants' hands and move distribution to areas under Israeli military control.

          <p>John Woeltz, a 37-year-old crypto investor, and Beatrice Folchi were arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was reportedly held captive and tortured for three weeks in Woeltz's SoHo home. Police discovered Polaroid photos of the victim tied up and tortured, along with a firearm and items used for torture.

          <p>French authorities suspect arson played a role in a major power outage in southeast France that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival's closing celebrations. The power outage, affecting about 160,000 households, was caused by a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes and a fallen high-voltage line. Despite the disruption, the Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to an independent power supply. Authorities are investigating the acts of damage to electrical infrastructures.</p>
