          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, with all planes reportedly outside Iranian airspace. Trump warned Iran to pursue a peace deal with Israel, threatening further attacks if peace is not achieved quickly. The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically to assure them that regime change is not the goal, and alerted Israel before the strikes, which were praised by Prime Minister Netanyahu. The response from U.S. lawmakers has been mixed, with some Republicans supporting the strikes and Democrats criticizing the lack of congressional authorization.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers from both parties offered mixed reactions. Republicans largely supported the action, emphasizing the need to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, while Democrats criticized the lack of congressional consultation and authorization. Some Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, argued the strikes were unconstitutional and risked a wider conflict in the Middle East. Conversely, some Democrats like Sen. John Fetterman supported the strikes. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and legislative branches regarding the use of military force.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast, reorganizing it into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine, reflecting a balance between passive and active forces. This research provides new insights into the molecular life mechanisms of this single-celled eukaryote.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that U.S. airstrikes have "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's key nuclear facilities, marking the United States' entry into Israel's war against Iran. Trump stated that the objective was to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the nuclear threat. He warned of future attacks if Iran refuses peace, while also thanking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for their teamwork. The United States joining Israel's war against Iran is expected to escalate tensions, with potential strikes on American troops and military bases in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, seen as a key indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party is aiming to retain its seats despite low approval ratings. Major parties are actively using social media and street speeches to appeal to voters on issues such as inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. The election is also notable for the participation of a new party launched by Shinji Ishimaru, who gained prominence in the 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial race.</p>

          <p>The United States bombed Iran, involving itself in a Middle Eastern war, a move President Trump had vowed to avoid. While some hope this will lead to the end of Iran's nuclear ambitions and regime change, others fear it could escalate into a wider conflict. The most optimistic view is that the introduction of American force will produce a humiliating end to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, enable more political disorder in Iran, and finally create the conditions for the fall of the mullahs. The worst-case scenario involves Iran retaliating against U.S. targets and accelerating its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>Three people are dead in North Dakota, and tens of thousands are without power in northern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin after powerful winds swept across the upper Midwest Friday and overnight Saturday. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley says the complex storm system produced tornadic activity, large hail and strong wind gusts. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner said at a press conference Saturday that two men and a woman were killed at two separate locations in the town of Enderlin, North Dakota, late Friday. A tornado warning was issued for Minnesota's Beltrami County just after midnight, with torrential rains causing flash flooding in downtown Bemidji and downed trees blocking dozens of roadways, according to county emergency manager Christopher Muller.</p>

New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original verdict. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Dorotik secured new DNA testing and a fresh examination of other evidence, which altered the course of the case.
