        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has stated that recent media reports concerning the cause of the fatal Air India crash are speculative and premature. This statement follows the release of a preliminary report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which noted a conversation about engine fuel cutoff switches in the cockpit voice recording. The NTSB, along with Indian officials, is urging patience and caution, emphasizing that complex investigations of this scale require significant time to reach definitive conclusions and avoid irresponsible reporting. The focus remains on a thorough and methodical investigation process.</p>

          <p>A major fireworks display at the Rheinkirmes fair in Düsseldorf, Germany, was abruptly halted after 19 people, including at least one child, were injured. Four of the injuries were reported as serious when several rockets misfired, exploding too low and flying sideways into the crowd. Eyewitnesses described chaotic scenes as some rockets detonated near the ground and others landed in the Rhine River. Emergency services responded quickly, and event organizers ended the festivities early to prevent panic. The incident has prompted an investigation into the cause of the fireworks malfunction and safety protocols at the large public event.</p>

          <p>Edwin J. Feulner, a co-founder and the longest-serving president of The Heritage Foundation, has passed away at the age of 83. Feulner was a highly influential figure in the American conservative movement, credited with transforming the think tank into a major policy force in Washington, D.C. He led the organization from 1977 to 2013 and again briefly in 2017-2018, shaping Reagan-era reforms and remaining active through initiatives like Project 2025. In a statement, Heritage leaders praised him as a visionary and patriot who championed a unified, 'big-tent conservatism.' The cause of death was not disclosed.</p>

In contrast, the Galaxy is at the bottom of the conference standings, making this derby a crucial match for both pride and momentum.

The Metropolitan Police conducted a seven-month surveillance operation, tracking the gang as they collected drugs from ports and distributed them nationwide.

While some analysts believe the 38-year-old Usyk's skill and experience will secure him another victory, others point to Dubois's improved form, confidence, and exceptional power as key factors that could lead to an upset.

The innovative approach uses gene therapy tools to produce the necessary anticancer cells directly within the patient's body, a significant departure from the costly and complex conventional method. This breakthrough could drastically reduce the cost of treatment, which currently exceeds one million yuan (US$139,200) per patient. The successful treatment of four multiple myeloma patients using this new technique was recently detailed in the journal The Lancet.</p>

The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that has left the ground dry and hard, increasing the likelihood of rapid surface water runoff.

The publisher, Dow Jones, has expressed full confidence in its reporting and stated it will vigorously defend against the suit. The legal action comes as the Trump administration faces pressure to be more transparent about the Epstein case, with the Justice Department moving to unseal related grand jury transcripts.</p>

          <h2>EPA Eliminates Its Scientific Research Division, Impacting Hundreds of Scientists</h2>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the elimination of its primary scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). This move is part of a broader agency reorganization and is expected to impact many of the office's over 1,500 employees, including leading scientists. The EPA stated the decision would result in $748.8 million in savings and is part of an effort to streamline operations and reduce its workforce, which has already been cut by 22%. Critics, including a former EPA official, condemned the move as dangerous, arguing it dismantles a respected research organization and leaves the public more vulnerable to pollution.</p>

          <p>Beijing's top disciplinary commission is using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The 'Yaohan Longevity City' project, initially a key initiative, was condemned for being out of touch with reality, resulting in a severe waste of resources with multiple buildings left abandoned. The investigation found that due to a broken capital chain and poor decisions by local officials, only a fraction of the planned 1.65 billion yuan investment was spent. The case is being highlighted as a stark warning to other local governments across China to avoid making similar blind and impractical decisions.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose a More Powerful 'Super X-Railgun' Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have proposed a new 'X-railgun' design that could nearly double the firing power of China's existing naval electromagnetic railgun. The current naval version, the first to be mounted on a ship, is limited by the weight of its projectile, which hampers its effectiveness against large targets. The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single weapon, which would significantly increase bore pressure. This would allow it to fire much heavier, 30kg shells at speeds of Mach 7, potentially overcoming the power limitations of the current technology.</p>

          <p>According to the Environment Agency, the number of serious pollution incidents caused by water companies in England surged by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest level on record. There were 75 incidents classified as causing 'serious or persistent' harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being responsible for the vast majority. A cross-party committee of MPs described the situation as 'woeful,' blaming a lack of investment and weak regulation for the record levels of sewage polluting rivers. The data has intensified scrutiny on the water industry and its regulators ahead of a landmark review of the sector.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with President Trump again calling for lower interest rates and criticizing Powell as one of his 'worst appointments.' The White House Office of Management and Budget also questioned Powell over the cost of renovations at the Federal Reserve headquarters, which Powell defended as a carefully overseen and necessary project. Trump's social media posts accused the Fed of 'choking out the housing market,' placing blame on both Powell and the Fed Board for harming the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority of the public continues to believe the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile endeavor. These views are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, suggesting a widespread belief that the U.S. space program contributes to national pride and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are redefining the global AI landscape by releasing powerful open-source large language models (LLMs). This strategy contrasts with the closed, proprietary systems of U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google, which have restricted access to their most advanced models in China. The availability of these free-to-use Chinese models has unleashed a wave of AI applications in the country and won support from developers worldwide. Analysts suggest this open-source movement poses a serious competitive challenge to Silicon Valley's long-held dominance in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The CEO of U.S. tech company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has been placed on leave after a video of him embracing a woman at a Coldplay concert went viral online. The clip, which showed the pair abruptly hiding their faces when they appeared on the stadium's large screen, fueled widespread rumors of an affair, with the woman identified online as another company executive. In response to the online speculation, Astronomer's board announced it has initiated a formal investigation into the matter and appointed a co-founder as interim CEO. The company's statement confirmed Byron's leave but did not confirm the identity of the woman.</p>
