          <p>A recent Fidelity Investments report indicates that the average 401(k) balance decreased by 3% in the first quarter of 2025, settling at $127,100, while IRA balances also fell by 4% to $121,983 due to market volatility. Despite these declines, both 401(k) and IRA balances showed year-over-year growth, with the majority of retirement savers continuing to contribute. The average 401(k) contribution rate rose to 14.3%, nearing Fidelity's suggested 15% savings rate, as experts advise maintaining a long-term investment strategy to weather market fluctuations and avoid short-term reactions. According to financial advisors, trying to time the market often leads to losses, and investors should focus on the long-term benefits of staying invested in volatile assets.

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected ADP jobs report, President Donald Trump publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. The ADP report showed private payrolls increasing by only 37,000 in May, significantly below the Dow Jones forecast of 110,000, and Trump criticized Powell for not lowering rates to gain an economic advantage over countries like China. This call comes after Trump met with Powell at the White House, where he reportedly accused Powell of making a mistake by not lowering rates. The Fed maintains that monetary policy decisions are based on objective economic data, not political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities are investigating whether Park assisted Bartkus in the attack, which gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic and damaged nearby buildings. The investigation is ongoing, with federal prosecutors expected to release further details at a press conference in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has officially ended its two-child policy, which had been in place since 2009 to prevent overpopulation, due to concerns about declining birth rates and a shrinking working-age population.

The Ministry of Health estimates Vietnam's population to be just over 100 million, but the national fertility rate dropped to 1.91 per woman in 2024, below the replacement level. Lawmakers are also addressing sex imbalances caused by prenatal gender selection, proposing increased fines for pre-birth sex selection.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which experts predict will increase costs for a variety of consumer products. Industries such as automobile manufacturing, sports equipment, and canned goods are expected to be affected, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. While some businesses may absorb some of the increased costs, many are likely to pass them on to customers. The tariffs are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, but economists warn they could hurt industries and strain consumers.</p>

          <p>According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), President Trump's proposed budget bill would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance by 2034, primarily due to cuts in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. The bill aims to cut $1.5 trillion in spending while also implementing significant tax cuts, but the CBO projects spending cuts at $1.2 trillion and tax cuts totaling nearly $3.7 trillion. House Republican leadership has dismissed the CBO's findings, arguing that the bill will stimulate economic growth and reduce the deficit.</p>

          <p>A federal investigation revealed that a Texas hospital violated the law by denying a woman, Kyleigh Thurman, an emergency abortion for a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy. The hospital repeatedly sent Thurman home without providing necessary treatment, resulting in the loss of part of her reproductive system. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) concluded that the hospital failed to provide a proper medical screening exam and stabilizing treatment, violating the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The findings highlight concerns about emergency abortion access in states with strict abortion bans, though a new policy announced by the Trump administration has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions.</p>

McCook was credited with saving the life of Sgt. John Boyd, who survived the crash after McCook maneuvered the damaged plane to allow Boyd to parachute out. McCook's remains were not recovered until 1947, and were interred as "Unknowns" at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific until recently.

          <p>Shares of CrowdStrike experienced a decline after the cybersecurity company issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter, citing the ongoing impact from a July IT outage. The company expects revenue between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, falling short of analysts' estimates, and adjusted earnings per share between 82 cents and 84 cents. The company is still feeling the effects of the previous year's outage, which led to the end of its customer commitment packages, reducing revenue by about $11 million in the quarter. Despite the weaker guidance, CrowdStrike reported better-than-expected earnings and announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan. (not investment advice)</p>

Employees deferred a milestone 9.5% into 401(k) plans, and companies contributed 4.8%, bringing the rate closer to Fidelity's recommended 15% savings target. The increased employee deferrals were largely driven by "auto-escalations," which automatically boost savings rates over time, and advisors suggest saving at least enough to get the full employer 401(k) matching contribution. While experts recommend saving at least 15% of pre-tax income each year, the ideal percentage depends on individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has indicated that a trade deal struck with the US last month could be implemented soon, as the White House signaled that the UK would be spared from the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs. Donald Trump decided to "provide different treatment" to the UK after the deal was agreed upon, though it is yet to be signed, and Starmer hopes it will be implemented quickly. While levies will remain at 25% for imports from Britain, the higher 50% could be imposed if the US administration determines that the UK has not complied with relevant aspects of the deal. Industry bodies have welcomed the decision to keep tariffs at 25% but emphasize the need for the UK government to finalize the trade deal to remove tariffs altogether.</p>

While Trump has defended Barrett in public, sources confirm that he has expressed frustration with his Supreme Court picks, feeling they could do more to support his agenda.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks to determine if a new strain, GII.17, will disrupt the typical seasonal pattern. Last year's norovirus season started in October due to the emergence of GII.17, which drove a record wave of outbreaks. GII.17 has now displaced the previously dominant GII.4 strain, raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again, with shifts in norovirus strains occurring when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up to previous strains. The CDC is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory database, but there is no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.</p>
