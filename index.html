          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell significantly after the company issued a disappointing forecast for the upcoming quarter. While its third-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed estimates, the outlook was clouded by macroeconomic and policy uncertainties, particularly affecting its business in China. The company anticipates a revenue decline due to reduced demand from leading-edge customers and a digestion of capacity in the Chinese market, highlighting the challenges facing the semiconductor industry.

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has experienced a remarkable surge of over 1,700% since its 2020 public listing, largely fueled by its government contracts and investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.

Despite its massive valuation, which surpasses many tech giants with higher revenues, analysts note its high price-to-earnings ratio, indicating that investors are paying a significant premium based on future growth expectations.

          <p>China has made significant early purchases of soybeans from Brazil for September and October, a move that encroaches on the peak export season for U.S. farmers. This shift reflects Beijing's increasing trade reliance on South America amid ongoing political tensions with the United States. By securing a large portion of its demand from Brazil, China is effectively shortening the sales window for American soybean producers, which is expected to keep global prices for the commodity under pressure.

          <p>Under the new federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force, Police Chief Pamela Smith has issued an order expanding cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The new policy allows Metropolitan Police Department officers to share information about individuals not in custody and to transport federal agents and detainees. This marks a significant shift from the city's previous "sanctuary" policies, which limited such collaboration, and comes as the Trump administration increases federal law enforcement presence in the capital.</p>

          <p>David Zervos, a potential candidate to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair, has argued for aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the labor market. The Jefferies chief market strategist stated that despite recent inflation data, monetary policy remains restrictive and that a half-percentage-point cut is warranted. Zervos joins a growing list of potential Fed nominees and represents a voice from Wall Street more focused on market dynamics, suggesting a more proactive approach to monetary policy to forestall an economic slowdown.

The plan has drawn immediate condemnation from the U.S., U.K., E.U., and the U.N., who view the expansion of settlements as a flagrant breach of international law and a major obstacle to a two-state solution.</p>

The data, which showed the largest increase in a key inflation metric since March 2022, was described by one analyst as a "kick in the pants" for markets hoping for aggressive easing. This development gives the Fed more reason to be cautious, potentially delaying or reducing the number of rate cuts previously anticipated by investors this year. (not investment advice)</p>
