          <p>Emma Raducanu has advanced to the second round of the DC Open after a challenging straight-sets victory over seventh-seed Marta Kostyuk. In her first singles match since Wimbledon, Raducanu fought through a grueling 71-minute first set and maintained her composure despite a late rally from her opponent. This win marks a positive start to her US Open preparation. The same tournament saw Venus Williams achieve a historic victory, becoming the oldest player to win a tour-level match in over two decades.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' highest court is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations countries have to protect the climate system from human-caused emissions. This action was prompted by a request from the UN General Assembly, led by vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu that face existential threats from rising sea levels. While non-binding, the court's opinion could establish a significant legal precedent and become a powerful tool for future climate-related litigation against governments worldwide.</p>

          <p>A significant heat dome is forming over the United States, poised to bring extreme and dangerous temperatures to millions from the South through the Midwest and into the East. Heat alerts are in effect for over 60 million people, with heat index values expected to climb well into the triple digits, creating severe health risks. The intensity of the heat will be exacerbated by high humidity and warm overnight temperatures that offer little relief, a phenomenon made more frequent by climate change.</p>
