          <p>The U.S. defense chief stated that the recent strikes on Iran were not intended to instigate regime change. This announcement follows escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, with the U.S. now directly involved. The statement aims to clarify the objectives of the military action, emphasizing a limited scope rather than a broader political goal. The U.S. seeks to reassure international partners and domestic audiences about its intentions in the region. Optimism that this is an isolated incident is moderate.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming it as a "spectacular military success." According to reports, B-2 bombers dropped Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, and Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from a U.S. Navy submarine. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to speak from the Pentagon to provide further details on the operation. The strikes represent a major escalation in the already volatile situation in the Middle East, raising concerns about potential retaliation and regional stability.

          <p>The Israeli military announced the recovery of the remains of three hostages from the Gaza Strip, identified as Yonatan Samerano, Ofra Keidar, and Shay Levinson, who were killed during the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the campaign to return the hostages continues alongside the campaign against Iran. The Hostages Families Forum has emphasized that bringing back the remaining hostages is key to achieving any sort of victory, while Hamas insists on the release of Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in exchange for the hostages. The situation remains tense as Israel continues its offensive, and the recovery of the hostages' remains offers a small measure of closure amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

Trump announced the operation, targeting key nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, and declared it a "very successful attack." The overnight strike involved bunker buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles, marking a major escalation in the Middle East.

          <p>A 68-year-old Mexican-born man died while being transported between a local jail and a federal ICE detention center, marking the first such death in at least a decade. Experts warn that more deaths are likely due to the Trump administration's "mass deportation" push. The death occurred as private companies with minimal oversight are increasingly tasked with transporting detainees across the U.S. The family of the deceased man reports a confusing series of events leading up to his death, including a decline in health while in jail and the administration of medications. The incident has sparked concerns about the conditions and oversight of ICE detainees, especially during transportation.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the experience of never owning a smartphone and the changing perceptions surrounding this choice. Initially met with disbelief or disdain, the author now finds that being phoneless has become an object of fascination and envy as the costs of constant connectivity become more apparent. While acknowledging the downsides, such as missed opportunities and logistical challenges, the author argues that remaining offline has allowed for a better attention span and a greater awareness of the social changes brought about by ubiquitous smartphone use.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent U.S. attack on Iran, ordered by President Trump, will likely exacerbate existing problems in the Middle East. Despite Trump's claims, the attack is viewed as an act of war that could lead to an uncontrolled regional conflict. The move is seen as a trap set by Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, based on exaggerated claims about Iran's nuclear threat. The lack of a clear exit strategy and the potential for Iranian retaliation against U.S. bases in the region raise concerns about further escalation and global instability. The overall future of the area is quite uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation to discuss the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, describing the attack as a "spectacular military success." He warned of "far greater" attacks if Iran does not "make peace," stating that the targeted sites "have been completely and totally obliterated." Trump thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military, emphasizing the objective of ending "the nuclear threat posed by the world's No. 1 state sponsor of terror."
