          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, challenging state and city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit targets policies that prohibit holding individuals solely on immigration detainers and restrict information sharing with federal agencies. Colorado officials maintain they are not a sanctuary state and cooperate with law enforcement, while Denver's mayor emphasizes the need to protect sensitive locations from immigration enforcement. The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to compel local governments to assist with deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have resigned following a plea deal offered to a sheriff’s deputy convicted of using excessive force. The prosecutors objected to the new U.S. attorney's decision to offer a misdemeanor plea to Trevor Kirk, who was found guilty of assaulting a woman. The move to offer a plea deal after a conviction is considered unorthodox, raising questions about the integrity of the legal process. The resignations highlight internal conflict within the prosecutor's office and concerns over political influence in legal decisions.</p>

The officers are charged with second-degree murder and other offenses for their role in the fatal beating of Nichols.

          <p>A psychiatrist argues that while antidepressants can be transformative for some, there's a messier side often unacknowledged, including sexual side effects, manic episodes, and withdrawal symptoms. Despite the widespread use of these medications, there's a lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians in safely tapering patients off them. The author urges the medical community to engage seriously with patients' concerns, emphasizing that antidepressants, like all medical interventions, come with benefits and trade-offs. He also calls for private research funding organizations to step up and make the study of medication safety a research priority.</p>
