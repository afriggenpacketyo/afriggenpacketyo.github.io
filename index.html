          <p>Following a week of aerial attacks, President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is considered over. This announcement came after Iran reportedly launched a missile attack on the United Statesâ€™ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. While there were no reported casualties at the base, the situation remains tense as both sides navigate the fragile ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Following reports of Iranian nationals illegally entering the U.S., experts are warning that sanctuary cities may be vulnerable to Iranian-sponsored terror attacks. Concerns are heightened in jurisdictions obstructing ICE enforcement, with hospitals identified as potential soft targets due to Iran's past actions. Experts stress the importance of cooperation between federal, state, and local law enforcement to monitor and proactively respond to threats, particularly in California where laws may hinder cooperation with DHS. An attack would likely be a "suicidal move" for Iran, but the concern remains a "real concern".</p>

          <p>The federal government will fund Florida's effort to establish immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that FEMA will largely fund the facilities, which aim to support mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that "Alligator Alcatraz" and other facilities could house up to 5,000 detainees and could begin operations early next month. This plan illustrates a broader effort by Republican-led states to aid the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign.</p>

          <p>Veterinary surgeons and animal charities are warning that rising vet bills are causing more pet owners to put down their animals or delay treatment. Many attribute the increased costs to large corporations buying up practices, leading to a focus on financial targets. Animal welfare charities have seen a surge in applications for financial assistance, and some pet owners are choosing euthanasia due to cost pressures. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether a lack of competition in the veterinary sector has contributed to soaring prices.</p>

          <p>Sanseito, a new right-wing populist party in Japan, is gaining traction among younger citizens due to its anti-immigrant stance and calls for rewriting the postwar Constitution. The party exploits fears and frustrations related to economic stagnation and increasing tourism, with supporters complaining that foreigners receive better treatment than Japanese citizens. Sanseito supporters blend nationalism with a sense of crisis over their daily lives, advocating for tighter regulations on foreign land acquisition and stricter controls on foreign workers. The party's early support is partly attributed to pandemic fatigue and mask-wearing mandates.</p>

If no additional Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to hold his fire, hoping for earnest negotiations. This scenario suggests that Trump's high-risk maneuver may yield positive results, similar to the aftermath of the Soleimani killing in 2020.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without notice. This decision allows the administration to resume deportations while legal proceedings continue. Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the government of "flagrantly unlawful conduct" and undermining due process. The Department of Homeland Security called the ruling a victory for American safety and security, stating it can now remove illegal aliens to willing countries.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump characterized Iran's retaliatory missile attack as "very weak" and signaled a desire for de-escalation.

There are no active plans for the United States to retaliate further at this time, according to sources familiar with the president's thinking.

          <p>President Trump's recent remarks about regime change in Iran, including the phrase "Make Iran Great Again," have stirred controversy and internal conflict within his administration. This shift from discouraging Israeli strikes to considering broader ambitions contradicts previous non-interventionist pledges. The abrupt change has caused division among his aides, with some, like Vice President J.D. Vance, expressing views that differ sharply from Trump's current stance. Trump's transformation exemplifies the hubris of the Iraq War project, which he had promised to leave behind.</p>

Some experts argue that Article II gives the president the authority to use military force in certain circumstances, including preventing nuclear proliferation.

Disney remains optimistic that "Elio" will be discovered by families and moviegoers throughout the summer, similar to "Elemental."

          <p>China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, according to a top U.S. analyst. Instead, China would likely rely on quiet negotiations and self-interest, as demonstrated by its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. China's primary focus is protecting its own interests rather than policing global waterways, even though it depends heavily on Middle Eastern oil. Its approach will remain shaped by long-standing economic interests.</p>
