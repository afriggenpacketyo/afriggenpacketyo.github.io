          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a surprising increase in job openings to nearly 7.4 million in April, surpassing economists' forecasts and indicating a stable labor market. Hiring also saw a rise, with 5.6 million positions filled, while layoffs experienced a decrease, suggesting employers are retaining their workforce. Despite some economic uncertainty, the labor market appears to be returning to normal levels, with underlying patterns in hiring and firing remaining steady. However, new orders for manufactured goods fell more than expected, signaling declining demand after a surge in March. </p>

          <p>Anthropic's Claude 4 AI model has demonstrated the ability to work continuously for seven hours, marking a significant advancement in AI capabilities, however, AI programs face limitations on their work hours due to computing power constraints and memory capacity. MJ Jiang of Credibly explains that AI tools like ChatGPT may experience performance degradation during long conversations because the model may begin to "forget" earlier instructions and produce lower-quality responses. While a 24-hour AI workday may be technically possible in the future, the environmental impact and cost of computing power raise questions about its feasibility. The potential for water shortages due to the demand for water cooling is also a growing concern. </p>

The wraps will feature McCrispy Strips and come in spicy and ranch flavors, catering to customer demand and expanding McDonald's chicken offerings. This move is part of a broader strategy to compete in the fast-growing chicken restaurant category, potentially igniting the next stage in the chicken wars. </p>

          <p>The Dutch government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, has collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his PVV party from the ruling coalition due to disagreements over immigration proposals. Wilders stated that his party's asylum proposals lacked support, leading to their departure and the government's downfall. This collapse follows a history of conflicting ideas on immigration, which also caused the previous coalition to dissolve in 2023. The PVV had previously won a landslide victory in the 2023 general election, but conflicting views on immigration have now led to political instability. </p>

German national Christian Brückner, a prime suspect in the case, is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate sexual assault. The investigation continues, with British police treating it as a missing persons case, while German authorities suspect Brückner of murder, although he denies any involvement. </p>

President Trump is actively involved, meeting with senators to garner support, but some Republicans are calling for deeper spending cuts and opposing the debt ceiling increase.

David Chadwick, Liberal Democrat MP for Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast it was "HS2 all over again", while former Welsh Labour transport minister Lee Waters called for Westminster colleagues to "fix" the system.

Strategic use of temporary rate buydowns can offer more affordable rates in the short term, while negotiating closing cost credits from sellers can offset higher rates. Despite predictions of slightly lower rates later in the year, experts suggest that waiting for the "perfect" rate may result in higher home prices.

          <p>Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians near a Gaza aid distribution site, resulting in numerous casualties and prompting criticism of the new aid system. Witnesses described the scene as "total carnage," while the Israeli military claimed troops fired warning shots at suspects deviating from designated access routes. The new aid hubs, supported by the U.S. and managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, aim to replace UN operations, but have faced challenges and concerns over neutrality and impartiality. The distribution system has been described as chaotic, with aid not reaching the most vulnerable populations. </p>

          <p>Federal funding cuts of over $800 million to community-based organizations are significantly hampering gun violence prevention programs, particularly in underserved Black and Latino communities. Organizations like Operation Good in Jackson, Mississippi, face uncertainty after losing grants that supported youth programs, community cleanups, and resources for impoverished families. The cuts, initiated by the Trump administration, redirect funds to law enforcement agencies, reversing the Biden administration's focus on community-based violence intervention. The loss of funding threatens the livelihoods of intervention workers and could lead to an increase in violence in affected communities. </p>

Sales were led by a 17.2% increase in purchases of vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines and a 29% jump in hybrid models. These gains offset a 25% drop in sales of all-electric vehicles compared with May 2024. The employee pricing promotion was announced as President Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect. </p>
