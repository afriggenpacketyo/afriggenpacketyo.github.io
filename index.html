          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has dismissed South Korea's recent hopes for renewed dialogue between the two nations. She refuted claims that North Korea had started removing propaganda loudspeakers from the border, stating they have no intention of doing so. Kim reiterated that Pyongyang is not interested in negotiations with Seoul or Washington, citing upcoming joint military drills as evidence of their continued hostility. This firm stance underscores the deep-seated tensions on the peninsula, as the two Koreas technically remain at war.</p>

          <p>The landmark national security trial of pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai is nearing its conclusion in Hong Kong, drawing international condemnation and concern. The 77-year-old, who holds British citizenship, is accused of colluding with foreign forces and faces a potential life sentence. Critics argue the case exemplifies the use of Beijing's national security law to suppress political dissent and erode the city's autonomy. Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, has been a vocal critic of the Chinese government and a prominent figure in Hong Kong's democracy movement.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump has issued a formal demand for a retraction from Hunter Biden regarding comments he made linking her to the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. In a recent interview, Biden alleged that Epstein had introduced Melania to Donald Trump. Mrs. Trump's lawyer sent a letter calling the statements false, defamatory, and threatening a lawsuit if they are not withdrawn. The letter claims the widely circulated remarks have caused significant financial and reputational harm, echoing a legal strategy often employed by her husband.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops and armored vehicles have appeared on the streets of Washington D.C. after President Trump deployed them and took federal control of the city's police force. The administration cites a need to combat what it calls out-of-control violent crime, a claim disputed by local officials and crime data. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has labeled the move an "authoritarian push," while also coordinating with federal agents to enhance public safety. The deployment has heightened political tensions, with the White House vowing to relentlessly pursue criminals in the city.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported a significant increase in cases of the chikungunya virus, with over 70 infections in the first half of the year, more than double the previous year. All cases are linked to international travel, primarily to the Indian Ocean region where an outbreak is ongoing. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne illness causes fever and can lead to debilitating joint pain for months or years. Officials are urging travelers to take precautions like using insect repellent and covering up, as there is no onward transmission risk within the UK.</p>

          <p>Recent viral photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have sparked alarm online, but wildlife officials say there is a scientific explanation. The animals are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus, a disease common in the Midwest that causes keratinous tumors to grow on their heads. The virus, which is spread by ticks and fleas, is generally harmless to the rabbits unless the growths interfere with eating, and it cannot be transmitted to humans or other pets. The phenomenon is believed to have inspired the myth of the jackalope, a fabled rabbit with antlers.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates a growing trend of "bleisure" travel, where business and leisure are combined, with 55% of business travelers admitting they have had loved ones join them on work trips. For C-suite executives, this figure rises to 73%. The practice allows professionals to save on vacation costs and spend more time with family, partners, or friends while fulfilling work obligations. While many companies quietly permit this, employees often navigate a policy gray area, carefully separating personal and business expenses to avoid issues with insurance, taxes, and company reimbursement policies.</p>

          <p>A state judge in Texas has ordered that the assets of Infowars be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, a major step toward liquidating the company to pay the Sandy Hook families. The families won a $1.3 billion defamation judgment against Alex Jones for his false claims about the 2012 school shooting. The receiver now has the authority to seize all company property, including cash, equipment, and the Infowars brand itself, and sell them off. This move shifts the process from federal bankruptcy court to state court, potentially expediting payments to the families.</p>

          <p>Retailers and importers are expressing concern as U.S. tariffs contribute to rising prices for goods like coffee, tea, and spices. Coffee prices saw a significant 14.5% year-over-year increase in July, forcing small businesses to either absorb the costs or pass them onto consumers. Importers of products not grown domestically, such as coffee or certain spices, have limited options to avoid the tariffs by shifting their sourcing. The financial pressure threatens the viability of smaller, specialized brands that prioritize quality but have thin profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large study from Sweden suggests that medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) offers benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that drug treatment was linked to a reduced risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. These issues are often associated with impulsivity and distraction, which are common ADHD traits. Researchers say the findings provide valuable information for patients weighing the decision to start medication, as it confirms wider potential benefits for long-term life outcomes.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to ban the protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization is facing significant legal and political challenges. The ban has led to over 700 arrests of supporters, many of whom are elderly activists, creating a potential public relations issue for authorities. The group's fate now rests on three interconnected legal battles: the prosecution of the arrested supporters, the criminal trials of members for property damage, and a High Court review of the ban's legality. The outcome will determine the future of the group and set a precedent for protest rights.</p>

However, Premier Tim Houston called the province a "tinder box," noting that human activity causes nearly all wildfires there. With the region experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, officials argue the temporary ban is a necessary precaution to protect lives and property.</p>

          <p>New York's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the bank-owned parent company of the payment app Zelle. The suit alleges that EWS failed to implement adequate security safeguards, which allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from consumers between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims that flaws in Zelle's design, such as a quick registration process and lack of verification, made it highly susceptible to fraud. EWS has dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt," but the legal action seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers.</p>

The country's focus on patient autonomy means individuals can be eligible for MAID even if their condition is treatable, as long as the available treatments are unacceptable to them. This has placed a heavy burden on medical providers, who must make difficult discretionary judgments about who should be helped to die.</p>
