          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a 39% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong investment banking performance. However, the bank has also increased its credit provisions, citing uncertainties in the geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the U.S. The lender's core investment banking division saw a 10% rise in net revenues, while asset management revenues increased by 18%. Despite the positive results, analysts noted mixed divisional trends and flagged the bank's provision guidance as including a caveat for economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a comeback victory in Canada's federal election, largely attributed to the influence of President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. While it remains unclear whether the Liberals will secure a majority government, their victory marks a significant turnaround from previous declines in popularity. Trump's remarks about annexing Canada and imposing tariffs became central issues in the campaign, influencing voters' choices. Domestic issues such as affordability and immigration also played a role, but Trump's actions ultimately boosted the Liberal Party's chances.</p>

Critics view the lawsuit as part of Beijing's assault on rights and democracy, while officials say the national security law was necessary to restore order.

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius expressed skepticism about Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposed May 8-10 ceasefire in Ukraine. Pistorius noted that past experiences indicate such declarations often amount to little. He emphasized the importance of continued U.S. support for Ukraine's defense, highlighting the war's impact on European security. In a separate incident, a Russian drone strike resulted in the death of a 12-year-old girl and injuries to her parents in central Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 is set to introduce new regulations in 2026, primarily driven by a desire to attract new manufacturers. The engine rules will retain 1.6-liter V6 turbo hybrids but simplify them by removing the MGU-H and increasing electrical capacity. This has led to Audi's entry and Ford's partnership with Red Bull. The new engine rules require further changes to the chassis, including moveable aerodynamics. While the new rules may initially disrupt the field, they are expected to create opportunities for a shake-up in the competitive order.</p>

Pakistan denies involvement and calls for an international investigation. India has provided little public evidence linking the attack to Pakistan. The Kashmir conflict's roots trace back to the 1947 partition, with Pakistan previously supporting militant groups in the region.</p>
