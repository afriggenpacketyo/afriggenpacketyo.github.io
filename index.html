          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan to bring a second runway into regular use at London's Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project, which involves moving the existing northern runway, is expected to increase flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 annually by the late 2030s. Despite government support, the expansion faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate impacts. The airport has agreed to stricter noise controls to mitigate some of these concerns.</p>

          <p>Protests occurred across all 26 states of Brazil against legislative measures that could grant amnesty to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted for a 2023 coup attempt. The demonstrations were sparked by the lower house fast-tracking a bill that could pardon those involved in the uprising, following Bolsonaro's 27-year prison sentence. Prominent artists and cultural figures helped organize the rallies, criticizing the move as a self-serving effort by lawmakers to shield themselves from justice. The protests highlight the deep political divisions that persist in the country.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, Team Europe's Rory McIlroy has dismissed trash talk from Team USA's Bryson DeChambeau. McIlroy suggested that DeChambeau only mentions other high-profile players like himself or Scottie Scheffler to gain attention. The rivalry between the two golfers has intensified following their showdowns at the Masters and the U.S. Open, and is further fueled by McIlroy's vocal opposition to LIV Golf, where DeChambeau plays. This exchange sets a contentious tone for the upcoming tournament, where intense fan engagement is expected.</p>

          <p>Iranian labor rights activist Sharifeh Mohammadi is facing execution after her death sentence for "armed rebellion against the state" was upheld for a third time. The 46-year-old engineer was arrested in December 2023 for her union activities, which the government deems an "opposition group." Human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings, citing serious procedural flaws and a lack of evidence connecting her to any armed actions.

          <p>The mother of Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was held by Hamas for 15 months, has accused the UK government of "rewarding" the group by formally recognizing a Palestinian state. Mandy Damari criticized the timing of the decision, noting that hostages are still being held and the conflict is ongoing with Hamas still in power. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the move, stating it is intended to revive hope for a two-state solution and is not a reward for Hamas, which he says can have no future role in government. The decision has been met with both praise from Palestinian leaders and condemnation from Israel.</p>

In a social media post, Trump expressed frustration that "nothing is being done," a statement that drew sharp criticism from Democrats who described it as a step towards authoritarianism. The call to action follows the departure of a federal prosecutor who reportedly concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute New York Attorney General Letitia James, an official Trump has targeted.

          <p>Gary Cohn, a former director of the National Economic Council under President Trump, stated that the U.S. job market has been degrading, a trend he believes may be temporary. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Cohn pointed to recent data showing a significant slowdown in job creation, from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 jobs per month. He attributes this to companies cutting labor costs to protect their margins in a difficult economic environment with rising input costs. Cohn suggests this shift from "labor hoarding" post-COVID to aggressive expense management is now clearly reflected in economic data, which influenced the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates.

          <p>The assembly line for China's first domestically developed large passenger jet, the C919, employs an advanced "smart factory" system to ensure production quality and avoid errors like missing bolts. The futuristic network integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect all sensors, robots, tools, and workers in a unified intelligent loop. This "sensing-transmission-control integration" differs from conventional factory systems by combining data collection, communication, and control processes. The technology aims to prevent the kind of high-profile manufacturing lapses that have affected other major aircraft producers in recent years.</p>

          <p>The contest for control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections is shaping up to be a toss-up, with both parties facing distinct advantages and challenges. Democrats are optimistic due to historical trends favoring the party out of power and President Trump's declining approval ratings. However, Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas and Missouri could neutralize these advantages by creating more GOP-friendly congressional maps. While Democrats are attempting to counter with their own redistricting in blue states, the overall landscape remains highly competitive and uncertain more than a year out from the election.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new rules for journalists that require them to sign an agreement not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing their press credentials. The directive, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, also limits reporters' movement within the building. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated that the "press does not run the Pentagon" and must follow the rules of a secure facility. The move has been condemned by journalism organizations and some Democratic lawmakers as an assault on press freedom and independent scrutiny of the U.S. military.</p>

According to advocacy groups, the strikers are demanding access to medical care, prescription medications, basic hygiene products, and clean drinking water. The facility, located in a former camp at the notorious state penitentiary, was recently opened by the Trump administration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents an analysis arguing that President Trump's public pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political rivals is a sign of his weakening political position. The author suggests that with declining public support, stalling job growth, and rising grocery prices, Trump feels an urgent need to consolidate authoritarian power before the 2026 elections. This creates a difficult calculation for officials like Bondi, who must weigh the benefits of loyalty against the potential legal risks if Trump's power fades. The piece concludes that Trump's project is a dangerously leveraged gamble that is becoming increasingly unstable.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has approved an 8% cut to the budget for the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, reducing it to just under €10 billion. Development Minister Reen Alabali Radovan acknowledged that this reduction means Germany is investing far less than needed to address increasing global crises. Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that over four million people will lose food aid as a result. The move is part of a broader trend among Western donor countries to reduce financial commitments to international aid.</p>

The move is intended to stabilize the defense following the departure of coordinator Ikaika Malloe after the team's 0-3 start. Coyle, 69, has extensive experience as a defensive coordinator in both college football and the NFL, and previously worked with Skipper at Fresno State. The Bruins' defense has struggled significantly this season, and the hope is that Coyle's hiring will help improve its performance as they enter Big Ten Conference play.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market's record-breaking rally could have more room to run. Optimism is fueled by the artificial intelligence boom and easier financial conditions, with some analysts arguing that AI-driven productivity gains justify the high valuations of major tech stocks. While the S&P 500's valuation is high by historical standards, strategists note the index's composition has changed significantly. However, some veterans caution that further "melt-up" rallies could fuel speculative excess rather than reflect economic fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. On a recent podcast, she explained that stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes, which naturally shrink with age but do so more rapidly under constant stress. However, Epel notes that this damage can be reversed through lifestyle changes that promote restoration and reduce inflammation. She recommends simple, sustainable practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, increasing Omega-3 intake, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork.</p>

          <p>Turkey's primary opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), has re-elected Ozgur Ozel as its chairman in an extraordinary congress. The move is seen as an effort to provide him with a fresh mandate and protect him from an upcoming court ruling that could annul his initial 2023 election victory. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has criticized the 2023 vote as fraudulent, and a court is set to rule on the matter in October. The re-election is a strategic maneuver by the opposition to demonstrate party unity and shield its leadership, including jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, from what they describe as a government crackdown.</p>
