          <p>Three miners are trapped underground following a collapse at the Red Chris mine in northern British Columbia. Officials report the workers are uninjured and have taken shelter in a refuge station equipped with sufficient food, water, and ventilation for an extended stay. The mine operator, Newmont Corp, has halted all operations after a second ground fall further blocked access and restricted communication. The rescue mission is currently in progress for the men, who were working more than 500 meters deep when the incident occurred.</p>

          <p>Three officials fired from the Department of Justice during the Trump administration have filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi, seeking reinstatement and back pay. The plaintiffs, including a prosecutor who handled January 6 cases, claim they were terminated without specific cause and in violation of standard procedures for civil servants. Their lawsuit argues that the dismissals were arbitrary and that the Attorney General does not possess absolute authority to remove employees. The action highlights ongoing tensions regarding personnel changes within the Justice Department following the presidential transition.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Make First Direct Observation of Quantum Friction Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists in China has successfully captured the first direct experimental evidence of quantum friction between two solid surfaces using folded graphene. The researchers from the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics observed that friction did not uniformly increase with the material's thickness, with some thicker folds sliding more easily. This counterintuitive finding is attributed to changes in electron movement within the bent material, which limits the conversion of motion into heat. The breakthrough could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear and tear.</p>

          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe has expressed strong support for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's public release of sensitive documents concerning Russian activities during the 2016 election. A CIA spokesperson stated that Ratcliffe initiated the declassification process to enhance transparency. The documents, including a 2017 House Intelligence Committee report, have fueled claims from Gabbard that Obama-era officials manufactured a narrative to undermine President Trump. The release has sparked criticism from some lawmakers who warn it could endanger sensitive intelligence sources and methods.</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, located north of Dallas, has been identified by the Census Bureau as the fastest-growing city in the United States, with its population surging from 17,000 to 37,000 in just three years. This explosive growth is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for significantly less than the county median. However, the rapid development has created significant growing pains, forcing a temporary halt on construction to allow essential infrastructure like water, sewer, and roads to catch up. The city is now racing to manage its expansion, with projections expecting the population to reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has initiated a Family Assistance Program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration raids. Archbishop José Gomez stated that many hard-working immigrants are now fearful of going to work or being in public. The program will leverage existing parish networks, developed during the pandemic, to serve vulnerable members across Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties. The initiative has already received significant donations to support its efforts.</p>

          <p>Pop star and actress Renée Rapp has embraced her reputation for being unfiltered in media interviews, stating that formal media training feels boring to her. Known for her candid and often off-script remarks during the "Mean Girls" press tour, Rapp says she prefers interviews to be like genuine conversations. While initially feeling insecure about the public analysis of her personality, she has since accepted it and even references it in her music. The 25-year-old artist values authenticity over providing carefully crafted, "fluffy" answers to questions.</p>

          <p>Four former traders convicted of rigging the Libor interest rate are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, in a related case. The men were all convicted in an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the manipulation of inter-bank lending rates, a scandal central to the 2008 financial crisis. Given the new legal precedent, the appeal process for these four individuals is expected to be more straightforward.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient, Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez, is being detained and faces expedited deportation after he says he made a wrong turn and accidentally drove into Mexico from San Diego. When he attempted to immediately re-enter the U.S., he was arrested for what the government calls "self-deportation" and an illegal re-entry attempt. His attorney argues the crossing was a brief, unintentional mistake and that his DACA status should be considered, but the government is showing no leniency. The case highlights the precarious situation for DACA recipients under current hard-line immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced severe flash flooding on Thursday following another day of heavy rainfall. The rushing water forced road closures and required the rescue of at least five people. The community has been highly vulnerable to flooding this summer due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the surrounding hillsides of vegetation. This event comes less than three weeks after a previous massive flood in the area killed three people and caused widespread damage to homes.</p>

          <p>The 2028 presidential race appears to have already begun, as several potential Democratic candidates are making strategic media appearances on non-traditional and ideologically diverse platforms. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are engaging with podcasts and shows popular outside the typical liberal media bubble, a strategy seen as a response to the party's 2024 loss. This shift also involves a change in rhetoric, with some candidates taking more moderate stances on cultural issues like gender identity, signaling a potential course correction for the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>Northern Finland's Lapland region is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record from 1972. The extreme heat is causing difficulties for the region's tourism and its famed reindeer population, which are fleeing to roads to escape insects. Scientists attribute the event's severity to climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The unusual weather highlights the accelerating and tangible impacts of global warming on fragile ecosystems.</p>

The FCC's sole Democrat dissented, calling the deal a move that would erode press freedom. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have suggested the deal appears linked to the settlement, raising questions about political influence over regulatory decisions.</p>
