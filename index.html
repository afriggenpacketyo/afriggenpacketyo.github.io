          <p>The U.S. secured the release of 10 detained Americans from Venezuela in a complex prisoner swap facilitated by El Salvador. In exchange, El Salvador repatriated over 200 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. and held in the country's CECOT mega-prison. The deal, announced by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, also included the release of some Venezuelan political prisoners. The deported Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador under the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act, a move that drew criticism for its lack of due process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, Dow Jones, and two Wall Street Journal reporters. The suit stems from an article alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" and sexually suggestive birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which included a hand-drawn naked woman. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, drawing the image, or using the language described, calling the story a "scam" and a "FAKE letter." He had previously warned Murdoch not to publish the story and is now following through on his threat to sue.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The incident, which occurred at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, represents the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. Officials stated the deputies were members of the elite Arson Explosives Detail. While the investigation is ongoing, preliminary reports suggest the blast may have involved a grenade recovered from a separate scene that the deputies were attempting to render safe. Federal agencies are assisting in the investigation.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from President Donald Trump, the Department of Justice has formally requested a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts from the cases of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This move comes after significant public pressure and criticism from conservatives for more transparency, particularly after a recent DOJ memo concluded there was no "client list." The filing cites "extensive public interest" and the administration's commitment to transparency, though it requests redactions to protect victim-related and personal information. The request aims to quell growing political controversy surrounding the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a specific interaction between a common gene variant and gut bacteria that can trigger the inflammatory response characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The research, published in Science Immunology, found that a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene fails to regulate an immune protein called STING. When certain gut bacteria produce a molecule called cGAMP, this unchecked pathway leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. This discovery helps explain the disease's variability and opens the door for developing more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific mechanism.</p>

Andy Ogles is demanding an investigation into Belmont University, a Christian institution in Tennessee, following allegations it is rebranding its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives to circumvent federal directives. Leaked recordings allegedly feature a university official admitting to changing the terminology of DEI programs, such as the "Office of Hope, Unity and Belonging," while continuing the same work. The official was also recorded admitting the school enrolls undocumented students, which Ogles suggests could violate state law.

          <p>The recent congressional vote to rescind federal funding for public broadcasting is expected to have a severe impact on rural and smaller market stations. Tom Michael, the general manager of Boise State Public Radio, explains that these stations are heavily reliant on federal dollars from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to operate. Unlike urban stations that can draw on larger pools of private donors, many smaller affiliates may face significant programming reductions or even closure. This loss threatens access to local news, emergency alerts, and educational content for communities that often have few other media options.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency plans to use government data from programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants, including those with criminal records who are in the U.S. illegally. He also defended the practice of ICE agents wearing masks during arrests, stating that while he is not a proponent, he will allow it for the safety of his officers amid a rise in attacks. Lyons attributed the increase in confrontations to the administration's expanded enforcement and "sanctuary" policies that force agents to conduct more arrests in communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several prominent Democratic politicians are condemning CBS's decision to cancel "The Late Show," suggesting the move could be politically motivated. Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Adam Schiff, among others, highlighted the suspicious timing, coming just days after host Stephen Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's $16 million legal settlement with Donald Trump. They have raised concerns about free speech and questioned whether the cancellation is tied to Paramount's pending merger, which requires approval from a federal commission. CBS and Paramount maintain the decision was purely financial, a claim met with skepticism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, viewing him as a flight risk as he faces charges of plotting a coup. The court also imposed a curfew and barred him from contacting foreign diplomats or his son, who is also facing charges. The move escalates a feud between Brazil's judiciary and the former leader, which has drawn in U.S. President Donald Trump, who has demanded the case be dropped. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has decried the threats as "blackmail," fueling nationalist sentiment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new animated "Smurfs" movie is described in a new review as a messy and strained effort that fails to capture the charm of the original characters. The plot, which recasts the Smurfs as cosmic guardians, is criticized as incoherent and overly reliant on a frantic pace, random gags, and multiverse-hopping. The voice cast, including Rihanna and James Corden, is said to sound disengaged. While there are brief moments of classic cartoon zaniness, the film largely adheres to generic CGI action and humor, ultimately failing to convincingly deliver its message of togetherness.</p>

          <h2>Commentary: A Congress That Abdicates Its Power to the Executive Branch</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 17:14:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary argues that the U.S. Congress has increasingly abdicated its legislative responsibilities, particularly under the Trump administration. It highlights instances where Republican members publicly criticize legislation but then vote in favor of it, effectively surrendering power to the executive branch. The article suggests this "Vote Yes/Hope No" approach stems from a fear of political backlash, allowing the president to seize authorities, like the power of the purse, that constitutionally belong to Congress. This dynamic, the author contends, is a form of "preening cowardice" that weakens the legislative branch.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll shows broad public support for U.S. space exploration, with about two-thirds of Americans favoring a return to the moon and an eventual mission to Mars. Younger Americans, who did not witness the original lunar landing, are especially enthusiastic about future missions. The 1969 moon landing is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement and a source of national pride. The poll also indicates that Americans believe the space program provides technological benefits for everyone, a sentiment that cuts across most political and ideological lines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed nearly 190% in one week, driven largely by social media posts from hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital took a new position in the struggling stock, predicted it could be a "100-bagger," leading to a massive surge in trading volume. The company's fundamentals have not changed, but Jackson's online influence created a speculative frenzy. The article details how the stock, which was at risk of being delisted, became a target for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward plays. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump establishes a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visa holders, such as international students and temporary skilled workers. The fee, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is intended to be refundable if visitors comply with their visa terms, though the mechanism for collection and reimbursement has not yet been established. Immigration advocates criticize the new charge, along with a new $100 fee for asylum seekers, for creating significant financial barriers to legal pathways into the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Druze are a religious sect with origins tracing back about 1,000 years to an offshoot of Shiite Islam, with a global population of roughly one million. Most live in Syria, with other significant communities in Lebanon and Israel. Their religious practices are largely secret, conversion is not permitted, and a core social tenet is the mutual defense of fellow Druze. In Syria, the Druze have historically maintained a degree of autonomy, forming armed militias for self-protection. The recent ouster of Bashar Assad has left the community divided and skeptical about their future under Syria's new leadership.</p>
