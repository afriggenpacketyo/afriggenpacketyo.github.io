          <h2>Trump Fails to Sway House Republicans on SALT Deduction Cap</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to persuade House Republicans to support a major tax bill have failed, as the 'SALT Caucus' remains opposed due to the bill's insufficient increase in state and local tax deductions. The current proposal raises the deduction cap to $30,000, but GOP lawmakers from blue states, particularly in the Northeast and California, find this inadequate. Trump urged the caucus to 'let it go,' but sources indicate that at least five members remain 'no' votes. The intra-party conflict threatens the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend. </p>

          <p>A recent New York Times article discusses the complexities surrounding prostate cancer screening, particularly for men over 70, highlighting that guidelines advise against routine screening after this age. The article notes that some men who diligently get tested may still develop aggressive cancer between checkups, or the PSA test can miss the cancer entirely. Experts emphasize that the PSA test is not perfect and that overtreatment can lead to devastating side effects, such as impotence and incontinence. The article underscores the importance of a complex conversation between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of screening. </p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man and a juvenile have been charged following an alleged homophobic attack on a young woman at a McDonald's in Carpentersville, Illinois.

The victim, Kady Grass, sustained severe injuries, including a broken nose, after the two males allegedly stomped on her head, causing her to lose consciousness.

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to unveil plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed 'Golden Dome,' to protect the United States from missile threats, potentially costing tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. Gen. Michael Guetlein will lead the project, which echoes President Reagan's 'Star Wars' program. The system's scope is unclear, including whether it will protect all U.S. territory or focus on major cities, and there are concerns about its impact on other vital programs. The US currently relies on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense program, but Trump wants a broader, more comprehensive defense system. </p>

          <p>As President Trump appears to be stepping back from trying to end the war in Ukraine, many Ukrainians express disappointment but remain resolute in their determination to fight on. After a phone call with President Putin, Trump suggested he was prepared to step back and stated that only Ukraine and Russia could resolve their differences. While this caused disappointment in Ukraine, it also meant reduced pressure, as Trump had previously pressed Ukraine to grant Russia all the territory it has gained in the war. Many Ukrainians believe that Putin has no intention of ending the fighting unless forced, and they consider his diplomacy a cover for intensified attacks. </p>

          <p>A new law in Washington state requiring priests to report child abuse disclosed during confession has sparked intense conflict between the Catholic Church and the federal government. The Archdiocese of Seattle has threatened to excommunicate priests who comply with the law, while the Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation, calling the law 'anti-Catholic.' The legislation, aimed at protecting children, removes exemptions for information learned through confession, a practice the church considers privileged and protected by religious oaths. Critics argue that removing this exemption could discourage individuals from confessing and seeking help. </p>

Machover's score evokes both the trauma and exhilaration of Schoenberg's spiritual progress, blending traditional instruments with new-world electronics.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. The agency said it wants to see new clinical trials showing Covid shots are still safe and effective before approving them for healthy adults and children, a costly new requirement for pharmaceutical companies that could limit who gets new jabs each year. For adults 65 and older, and for people as young as 6 months who have certain underlying health conditions, the FDA said it will accept immunogenicity data. The new guidance comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, overhauls the nation's health agencies and U.S. immunization policy. </p>

          <p>Two recent research studies underscore the vital role of Medicaid in saving lives, adding important data to the ongoing political debate in Washington, D.C. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act saved 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Additionally, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine examined Medicaid's effects on individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, finding that those who lost Medicaid were more likely to die. These findings highlight the potential human cost of restricting access to Medicaid. </p>

He identifies two types of hate: elemental hate, which is rare and destructive, and day-to-day hate, which stems from psychic atomization. He advises readers to name it, recognize it when it rises up, and detach. The column also addresses the overuse of the word 'existential,' noting that it is having a moment because we live in existential times. </p>

          <p>A maintenance worker has been arrested and charged with helping 10 inmates carry out a brazen escape from a New Orleans jail last week, bolstering the suspicion among investigators that the escape would have been impossible without inside help. The worker, Sterling Williams, 33, who was arrested on Monday, shut off water at the jail, allowing the inmates to remove a metal toilet and sink fixture from a cell wall, the Louisiana attorney general’s office said.  Officials did not notice that the inmates were missing until a routine head count at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, roughly seven hours after they had escaped, Sheriff Susan Hutson of Orleans Parish said last week. </p>
