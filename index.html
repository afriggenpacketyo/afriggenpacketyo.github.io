          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The meeting was initiated to determine if Maxwell possesses information about other individuals involved in Epstein's criminal network. This development occurs amid public and congressional pressure on the Department of Justice to release more information from the Epstein files. The DOJ recently stated a review found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail material against prominent individuals, a conclusion that has been met with skepticism.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve headquarters, intensifying his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. The visit follows Trump's suggestions that Powell could be fired over the rising costs of a Fed building renovation project, which have ballooned to $2.5 billion. Trump has long criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, a stance that challenges the central bank's traditional independence. This move is seen as a significant symbolic challenge to the Fed's autonomy from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Ryan Routh, the man charged with attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course, will be allowed to represent himself at his upcoming trial. Judge Aileen Cannon approved the request but mandated that his court-appointed public defenders remain as standby counsel. The decision came after Routh's lawyers filed to be removed from the case, citing an "irreconcilably broken" relationship and Routh's refusal to meet with them. Routh has pleaded not guilty to multiple federal and state charges.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that CEOs of major U.S. auto companies are "cool with" a new trade agreement with Japan, despite public criticism from their industry's policy group. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports, which is lower than the 25% tariff American companies face on vehicles they import from their own plants in Canada and Mexico. Lutnick dismissed concerns that this gives Japanese automakers an advantage, arguing that U.S. companies can avoid the tariffs by relocating their manufacturing facilities to America.

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting expressed deep regret over the situation as resident doctors in England commenced a five-day strike over a pay dispute. In a letter, Streeting accused the British Medical Association (BMA) of not negotiating in good faith, while the BMA maintained the walkout was a necessary last resort. The strike is expected to cause significant disruption to the National Health Service, which is attempting to maintain non-urgent care services. The dispute centers on pay restoration, with doctors arguing their wages have fallen by about 20% in real terms since 2008.</p>

          <p>Despite initial predictions, President Trump's sweeping tariffs have not yet caused runaway inflation, but economists caution that the full impact is likely still to come. Many companies have so far absorbed costs or used stockpiled inventory to avoid drastic price hikes, but this is not a sustainable strategy. The rollout of tariffs against many major trading partners was delayed, meaning their effects have lagged but will become more acute as they take hold. Experts predict consumers will begin to feel price increases on imported goods like electronics and apparel. (not investment advice)</p>

This makes it significantly harder to manage blood glucose and lower A1C, a key marker for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the key battleground state in 16 years. The 73-year-old governor cited a desire to spend more time with his family after a 50-year career in public service. His tenure has been marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively. His departure creates a high-stakes contest as Democrats also hope to gain control of the legislature under newly drawn maps.</p>

By starting conversations with seemingly innocuous questions, reporters were able to elicit detailed guidance on performing bloodletting rituals and even ending a human life. While OpenAI's policies forbid encouraging self-harm, the findings demonstrate how easily these safeguards can be bypassed. The chatbot's servile and encouraging tone highlights the potential for AI to amplify harmful delusions in isolated users.</p>

This article explores more aggressive strategies, such as fixed monthly payments, which can drastically reduce the timeline and total interest paid.
