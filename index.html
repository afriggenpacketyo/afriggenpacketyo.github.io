          <p>Former New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis is reflecting on the 2001 tackle that injured New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, paving the way for Tom Brady's legendary career. Lewis defends the hit as a standard football play, shifting responsibility to Bledsoe for choosing to run with the ball outside the pocket instead of staying protected as a passing quarterback. The article notes that Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowler, has largely avoided the spotlight since retiring, frustrated that his career is often defined by this single, history-altering moment. Lewis states the play is irrelevant to him personally, despite its immense significance in NFL history.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still in a protracted battle with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for rebuilding funds. Mayor Andrew Gilich states the city is owed $34 million for critical infrastructure projects, like upgrading the sewage and stormwater system, but is caught in a bureaucratic stalemate over escalating costs. The article highlights that Biloxi is not alone, with hundreds of other Katrina relief projects across the region remaining incomplete. The ongoing dispute underscores systemic issues within FEMA and the long-term challenges communities face in recovering from catastrophic disasters.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley played a role in starting the 6,800-acre Pickett fire. The investigation is reportedly looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard may have sparked the blaze, which ignited on the winery's property. A spokesperson for the winery confirmed they are cooperating with the investigation but declined to comment on the specific cause. The fire, which has threatened hundreds of buildings, is now 33% contained, with over 2,500 personnel assigned to the response effort in the steep, rugged terrain.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its long-standing "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers. Under the new rules, a refund will only be issued if the flight departs with at least one open seat, creating financial uncertainty and accessibility barriers for many. Advocates for the plus-size community have expressed disappointment, stating the previous policy was a rare example of accommodation and dignity in air travel. The change is part of a broader operational update as Southwest prepares to introduce assigned seating, a move that critics say further complicates travel for larger passengers.</p>

This attack, which killed at least 20 people, has drawn international condemnation. Israel's evolving narrative and the analysis of munitions used suggest a complex and controversial military action that experts say may have violated international law regarding protected sites.</p>

The company stated the terminations were due to serious violations of policy and creating safety concerns.

          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone assault on Kyiv has resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people, including four children, marking one of the deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in weeks. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched nearly 600 drones and over 30 missiles across the country, with strikes hitting residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, including a building housing the EU Delegation. The attack comes amid struggling peace efforts, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calling for stronger international sanctions in response.

The investigation traced many of these accounts to content creators in Pakistan who exploit the system by targeting Western audiences for higher ad revenue.

Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost to parents. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact caused by parents taking time off work to care for sick children, estimated to cost £24 million annually.</p>

          <p>In the midst of the tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, heroic actions by middle school students saved lives. According to officials and parents, older students immediately acted to protect their younger "buddies," a school tradition where they are paired with younger children for events like Mass. These middle schoolers pushed the younger children under the pews for cover, often shielding them with their own bodies, which resulted in many of them sustaining injuries. Emergency officials and the school principal have lauded the selfless and quick-thinking actions of these students and staff, which prevented an even greater catastrophe.</p>

          <p>An angler's discovery of a massive, 26-kilogram grass carp in Lake Huron has prompted a warning from Canadian officials about the threat of invasive species. Although this particular fish was sterile and unable to reproduce, the presence of even a single grass carp is alarming due to their voracious appetite for aquatic vegetation. These fish can consume up to 40% of their body weight in plants daily, destroying vital habitats for native species and degrading water quality. Officials are conducting surveillance and urging the public to report any sightings of the invasive carp, which pose a significant ecological risk to the Great Lakes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey of U.S. consumers indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is more likely to dissuade potential buyers than attract them. The report found that 35% of respondents were less likely to purchase a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% said it made them more likely to buy one. This sentiment poses a challenge for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk has staked the company's future value on the success of its autonomous vehicle technology. The findings suggest Tesla faces a significant market education and reputation problem, compounded by a recent sales slump and increased competition in the EV market.</p>

          <p>A Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), Colin Smyth, has had his parliamentary pass deactivated amid reports he placed a secret camera in a toilet at Holyrood. Smyth was already suspended from the Labour Party after being charged earlier this month with possessing indecent images of children. He is now reportedly facing a further police charge related to the camera allegations. The Scottish Parliament's chief executive informed members of the decision to bar Smyth from the building "given the ongoing criminal investigation," a serious development as parliament prepares to return from recess.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Kari Lake, a Trump administration official, cannot unilaterally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA), Michael Abramowitz. The judge stated that such an action is illegal without the backing of a congressionally mandated advisory panel designed to protect the broadcaster from political interference. Because President Trump has not filled the vacant seats on this panel, Lake lacks the legal authority to terminate the director. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to dismantle the international news agency and reinforces the legal firewall intended to maintain its journalistic independence.</p>

          <p>The complex relationship between China and Japan is currently highlighted by two contrasting trends: a surge in Chinese tourism to Japan and the massive box office success of a Chinese film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities. While nearly a million Chinese tourists visited Japan in July, the film "Dead to Rights," about the 1937 Nanking massacre, has become a blockbuster, reigniting memories of historical trauma. This paradox illustrates the enduring "love-hate" dynamic between the two nations, where deep historical wounds and geopolitical tensions coexist with strong economic interdependence and a mutual cultural affinity, 80 years after the end of World War II.</p>

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between President Donald Trump's assertions of unlimited power and the character of Homelander, the narcissistic and omnipotent antagonist from the TV series "The Boys." The author notes similarities in their demands for sycophantic praise from subordinates and their shared belief that they can "do whatever I want." The piece argues that while Homelander is a fictional supervillain, Trump is a politician constrained by the Constitution, laws, and the electorate. The author suggests that countering such authoritarian posturing requires citizens and officials to speak plain truth, use satire, and ultimately exercise their power at the ballot box.</p>
