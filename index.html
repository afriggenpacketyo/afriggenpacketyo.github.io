          <p>While in England for The Hundred cricket tournament, retired Australian cricketer David Warner has offered a critical assessment of English batter Joe Root's prospects in the upcoming Ashes series. Warner pointed out Root's historical struggle to score a century in Australia, attributing it to a technical flaw in his front-leg positioning. He suggested that England's success hinges on their bowlers making an impact on Australia's top order. The comments add a layer of psychological gamesmanship to the rivalry ahead of the highly anticipated series, which begins in late November.</p>

          <p>This article provides a data-driven overview of the U.S. economy's recent performance, presenting a mixed and chaotic picture. While headline GDP growth appears robust, underlying figures reveal concerning trends like a drop in private investment and wild swings in trade imports driven by tariff uncertainty. The analysis highlights the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut interest rates amid stubborn inflation and a significant, unexpected slowdown in job creation. This economic volatility challenges the administration's claims of a booming economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This short article, presented in comic form, delves into the common discomfort people feel when receiving praise. It explains that our reaction to a compliment often reveals our self-perception and can also impact the person offering the praise. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao provide insights into the science of compliments. They make a case for learning to accept kind remarks gracefully, highlighting the social and personal benefits of doing so, aiming to help readers navigate these interactions more comfortably.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable pattern has emerged in President Trump's second term, with foreign leaders increasingly employing praise and flattery as a key diplomatic tool. This contrasts with the skepticism that marked his first term and appears to be an effective strategy for achieving favorable outcomes, such as better trade deals or security commitments. Leaders from the U.K., Israel, and the EU have publicly complimented Trump's deal-making abilities and leadership. Analysts suggest this shift reflects a recognition that appealing directly to the president's desire to be seen as a winner is the most effective way to advance their national interests.</p>

          <p>Japan's meteorological agency has confirmed that the country just endured its hottest July since record-keeping began in 1898, with the average temperature being 2.89 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 norm. This marks the third consecutive year of a record-breaking July. Officials are warning that severe heat will persist, particularly in the northern and western regions, and have urged the public to take precautions against heatstroke. The extreme weather, linked to climate change, is also reportedly affecting the iconic cherry blossoms, causing them to bloom irregularly.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing a surprising link to an ancestor of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that the modern potato emerged from a hybridization event around nine million years ago between a tomato forerunner and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient cross-breeding was a key driver in the development of the tuber, the edible part that has made the potato a global staple food.

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a temporary restraining order preventing federal immigration agents from conducting "roving patrols" in Southern California without reasonable suspicion. The ruling affirms that factors like race, language, or location alone are insufficient grounds for a stop. The court's opinion rebuked the administration's arguments, stating they would not be harmed by an injunction that simply enforces constitutional standards. This decision is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over the Trump administration's aggressive deportation tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>Amid a scorching summer that has fueled wildfires across Greece, Turkey, and other European destinations, this article offers advice for concerned holidaymakers. Experts clarify that standard travel insurance should cover cancellations or curtailments if official advice, such as from the UK Foreign Office, deems travel unsafe. However, if travel is officially considered safe but a tourist wishes to cancel due to proximity to a fire, a claim is unlikely without specific catastrophe coverage. The article also outlines airline responsibilities regarding assistance for disruptions caused by such "extraordinary circumstances."</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's Skims brand has launched a facial shapewear mask, capitalizing on a TikTok trend of extreme bedtime beauty rituals, which has ignited a debate online. While some influencers praise the product for creating a "sculpted" jawline, critics and medical professionals condemn it as promoting harmful beauty ideals with no scientific backing. Doctors state that any effects from such compression garments are temporary at best and could cause skin irritation. The product's launch has been met with both rapid sales and accusations that it fuels insecurity among younger consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's General Administration of Customs has tightened import regulations for durians from Vietnam after detecting hazardous levels of cadmium and alkaline yellow in some shipments. The new rules mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and "batch by batch" testing upon arrival, with any non-compliant fruit being returned or destroyed. Exporters of failed shipments will be suspended from the Chinese market. These measures have already impacted trade, with the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China falling by approximately 45 percent in the first half of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the trade deal negotiated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with the Trump administration is a capitulation that damages the EU's credibility and economic interests. The authors contend that the agreement is a one-sided deal that favors the U.S., leaves key European industries vulnerable, and unwisely commits to massive EU investment in America. They call for EU governments and the European Parliament to reject the current terms, arguing that standing up to U.S. coercion would ultimately lead to a more balanced outcome.

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla liable in a 2019 fatal crash and ordered the company to pay $243 million to the family of the deceased victim and her injured boyfriend. The lawsuit argued that the vehicle's Autopilot technology failed, as it did not prevent the car from running through an intersection while the driver was distracted. The plaintiffs' attorney contended that Tesla irresponsibly marketed the system's capabilities, leading to the tragedy. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that drivers must remain fully attentive when using the assistance system.</p>
