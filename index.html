          <p>Apple has filed a lawsuit against a former senior design engineer, Di Liu, accusing him of stealing thousands of confidential documents related to the Vision Pro headset before leaving to join Snap. The lawsuit alleges Liu exploited his final two weeks at the company to exfiltrate proprietary information about Apple's technology, product design, and supply chain. This legal action is part of a broader pattern by the notoriously secretive company to aggressively protect its intellectual property by pursuing former employees who leak or steal internal data. Apple is seeking damages and a forensic inspection of Liu's devices.</p>

          <p>In a significant legislative battle, three Republican senatorsâ€”Susan Collins, Rand Paul, and Thom Tillisâ€”voted against President Trump's signature tax and spending bill, forcing a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. Collins cited concerns over deep cuts to Medicaid, which she argued would harm her constituents in Maine and threaten rural hospitals. Tillis also opposed the Medicaid provisions, having previously warned colleagues about the negative impact on North Carolina. Paul, a fiscal hawk, objected to the bill's failure to implement what he considered meaningful reductions to the national debt.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been indicted by a grand jury and charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared on Mother's Day in 2020.

The indictment highlights crucial evidence, including the discovery of chemicals used in a deer tranquilizer in Suzanne's remains, a substance for which Barry Morphew reportedly held the only local prescription.

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a deal to acquire UK lender TSB from its owner, Sabadell, for Â£2.65 billion. If approved, the takeover would create Britain's second-largest bank by personal current accounts and likely lead to the TSB brand disappearing from the High Street as it is integrated into Santander UK. While the companies describe it as an exciting new chapter, the merger is expected to result in job losses, particularly in duplicated back-office roles, and potential branch closures as Santander continues its shift towards digital banking.</p>

          <p>French tennis player Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard made history at Wimbledon by hitting a 153mph serve, the fastest ever recorded at the tournament, breaking the previous record by 5mph.

The record-breaking serve itself was returned by Fritz, and Mpetshi Perricard lost the point.

This approach differs from President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate all taxes on Social Security benefits, a change prohibited under the reconciliation process used to pass the bill.

          <p>The official government website hosting the U.S. National Climate Assessment, the nation's most authoritative report on climate change impacts, has been taken down by the Trump administration. This action follows the earlier firing of all staff who were working on the next edition of the congressionally mandated report. The assessment is a critical tool used by city planners, teachers, and citizens to understand and respond to global warming effects like sea-level rise and wildfires. While the primary site is dark, archived versions of the report remain accessible on other government websites.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Tax Break for Tipped Workers Included in Republican Spending Bill</h2>

          <p>A provision within the Republican's major spending bill aims to fulfill President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on tips for many workers. The proposal would create a new tax deduction for tip income, though the benefit would be temporary, expiring in 2028, and has different income caps in the House and Senate versions. Critics, including the Yale Budget Lab, argue the measure is poorly targeted, as it would not help the more than one-third of tipped workers who already earn too little to have a federal income tax liability.
