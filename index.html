        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data obtained by CBS News reveals that unlawful migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 apprehensions recorded. The Trump administration attributes this significant decrease to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced border security measures, which stand in stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration. Officials also noted that for the second consecutive month, no migrants were released into the U.S. pending their court cases. These policies, including swift deportations and the deployment of troops, have faced legal challenges and criticism from civil rights advocates.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value decreased by 7% ahead of its Q2 delivery report, a drop linked to a renewed public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The conflict centers on the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and electric vehicles. These legislative changes could negatively impact Tesla's sales and its energy division. In response, President Trump alluded to the substantial federal subsidies and contracts that Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have historically relied upon for revenue.

          <p>President Trump announced via social media that Israel has accepted the conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in its ongoing conflict with Hamas. While details of the proposal were not disclosed, Trump urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is their best possible offer. The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Previous ceasefire efforts have failed, and neither Israel nor Hamas has officially commented on this new proposal, which is reportedly being delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt. The war, which began in October 2023, has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee is intensifying its investigation into an alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's cognitive state during his time in office. The committee has scheduled transcribed interviews with nine former senior White House officials, including former chief of staff Ronald Klain, to determine who was making key executive decisions. Chairman James Comer has also issued subpoenas for Biden's physician and another senior aide. The probe aims to uncover whether White House staff usurped presidential authority and concealed the president's condition from the public, which Comer suggests may necessitate a legislative response.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, is suing the Trump administration for sharing confidential Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Health and Human Services illegally provided sensitive personal information to be used for immigration enforcement, creating a "culture of fear" that could deter people from seeking medical care. The administration defends the action as a lawful effort to combat fraud and ensure federal funds are not used for non-qualifying immigrants.

The move targets the country's high smoking rate, which contributes to 75,000 deaths annually, and is particularly concerned with the popularity of smoking among young people.

Church officials state the move is necessary to manage the claims equitably while continuing their ministry, but attorneys for the victims have condemned it as a delay tactic to evade accountability. The lawsuits were largely enabled by a California law that temporarily lifted the statute of limitations for such cases. Critics argue the bankruptcy process shifts focus from the victims' trauma to the church's corporate finances and could have been strategically delayed to weaken the survivors' positions.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet medical journal estimates that the Trump administration's shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could lead to 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. Researchers found that USAID programs have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades, with significant reductions in mortality from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and for children under five. The administration argues the agency was inefficient, while the study's authors contend that for a small taxpayer cost, the aid has had a massive life-saving impact. The findings present a stark, data-driven counterargument to the administration's foreign policy shift.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing an increasing risk of drought, with parts of England already in an official drought state following the country's sixth-driest spring on record. Low rainfall has led to below-normal river flows and exceptionally low reservoir levels, particularly in northern England. While some western areas saw more rain in June, dry conditions persist in the east, and long-term forecasts suggest this pattern may continue. The dry weather is already impacting farmers, who face higher irrigation costs, and threatening wetland wildlife habitats, raising concerns about the long-term effects of climate change.</p>

He suggests Meta's outperformance, following an initial dip, was driven by its surprisingly strong advertising business and impressive quarterly earnings.

The plea deal emerges after a judge rejected his defense's attempt to introduce potential alternate perpetrators at trial.

Analysts predict that export growth will likely slow or even contract due to a front-loading of orders and an expected slowdown in US consumer spending.

The author criticizes both parties for embracing debt-fueled largesse and budget gimmicks, asserting that the few pro-growth provisions are canceled out by other policies.

This move is intended to remove a major barrier to development, reduce the threat of lawsuits from project opponents, and address the state's severe housing affordability crisis.
