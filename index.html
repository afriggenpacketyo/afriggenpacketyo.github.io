          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly intensifying to Category 5. The storm is currently located north of the Caribbean, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, with tropical storm warnings issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its increased size could generate dangerous rip currents along the Southeast. The article explains that the storm's fluctuation in intensity is due to an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can temporarily weaken a powerful hurricane before it potentially re-strengthens.</p>

          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," Democratic Representative Jason Crow of Colorado sharply criticized the recent summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, labeling it a "historic embarrassment for the United States." Crow, a member of the Intelligence Committee, argued that the Trump administration is failing to apply the necessary pressure—economic, diplomatic, and military—that would motivate Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. He asserted that rolling out a red carpet for a "murderous dictator" undermines U.S. foreign policy and rewards Russia's aggression. The congressman also expressed concern that previous U.S. aid to Ukraine was just enough to prevent defeat but not enough to secure victory.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced plans to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a flight attendant strike that began Saturday, stranding over 100,000 travelers. The government ordered the striking workers back to work and referred the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for binding arbitration, citing risks to the economy. Despite the airline's announcement, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, representing 10,000 flight attendants, stated that demonstrations will continue as they demand a fairly negotiated contract. The core of the dispute centers on disagreements over pay and compensation for unpaid work hours.</p>

Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rubio emphasized that a lasting deal is the administration's goal, framing the recent summit with Vladimir Putin as a step that made enough progress to justify further talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies. He indicated that key areas for negotiation include security guarantees for Ukraine, the demarcation of territory, and plans for rebuilding the country. Rubio acknowledged that neither side is on the verge of surrender, making mutual compromise essential for any resolution.</p>

          <p>Manchester Originals secured a decisive 57-run victory against the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred, largely thanks to an impressive performance by captain Jos Buttler. Buttler scored an unbeaten 64, his second consecutive half-century, providing a strong foundation for his team's total of 171-3. The innings was powerfully concluded by Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 30 runs from the final seven balls. In response, the Superchargers were bowled out for 114, with bowlers Sonny Baker and Josh Tongue each taking three wickets, boosting the Originals' chances in the tournament.</p>

          <p>According to special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a significant concession during his summit with President Trump, agreeing to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5. Witkoff described this development as "game-changing," noting it was the first time Russia had consented to such a protective arrangement for Ukraine, which could address a key reason for Kyiv's desire to join NATO. He also stated that Russia agreed to legislate that it would not violate the sovereignty of other European nations. This potential breakthrough came as part of broader discussions aimed at creating a comprehensive peace deal to end the war.</p>

          <p>Terence Stamp, who passed away at 87, is being remembered as a quintessential star of 1960s "Swinging London" and a master of the "brooding silence." His career was launched with an Oscar-nominated role in "Billy Budd" and cemented by his portrayal of iconic villains, including General Zod in "Superman." After a period of disillusionment and travel in the 1970s, he reinvented himself, earning critical acclaim for his role as a transgender woman in "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."

The July report for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase. Based on this initial figure, analysts are projecting that the final 2026 COLA will likely be around 2.7%, a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025. The final determination will depend on the inflation data from August and September, with some experts anticipating higher inflation due to delayed tariffs, which could push the final COLA figure higher.

          <p>Hotter-than-expected wholesale and consumer inflation data for July is causing concern among some economists, who believe the Federal Reserve may need to reconsider cutting interest rates. While markets continue to price in a high probability of a rate cut in September, rising prices in the services sector suggest broad-based inflationary pressures that are not solely related to tariffs. This puts the Fed in a difficult position, as it must balance its goals of price stability and maximum employment, especially after recent data also suggested a softening labor market.

          <h2>Analysis: Putin Emerges as Victor from Anchorage Summit, Leaving Ukraine in a Perilous Position</h2>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that Russian President Vladimir Putin gained a strategic advantage from the recent summit in Anchorage, Alaska. Despite President Trump's goal of securing a ceasefire, he left empty-handed and instead appeared to accept Putin's position that a full peace agreement must precede any halt in fighting. Putin offered to freeze the front line in exchange for Ukraine ceding the entire Donbas region, a proposal that puts Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in a difficult position. The article suggests the summit sowed further mistrust between the U.S. and its European allies, strengthened Putin's diplomatic standing, and left Ukraine facing continued Russian aggression with diminished U.S. support.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Mayors Prepare for Potential Federal Overreach Amid Trump's Criticisms of Cities</h2>

          <p>Following President Trump's deployment of military assets in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles against the wishes of local officials, mayors of Democratic-run cities are preparing for potential federal intervention. City leaders state that while they welcome federal partnerships to address crime, they view Trump's actions as a politically motivated usurpation of local authority intended to create chaos. Mayors from cities like Seattle, Minneapolis, and Baltimore are coordinating with police chiefs and governors and preparing legal challenges should the administration attempt to deploy federal troops. They argue Trump's narrative of "liberal hellholes" is a distraction from his own failures and misrepresents the reality of declining crime rates in many urban areas.</p>

          <p>A transgender runner, Evie Parts, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Swarthmore College, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team due to her gender identity. The suit claims the NCAA, as a private organization, lacks the authority to issue its ban on transgender athletes, which she argues disregards federal Title IX protections and Pennsylvania state law. Parts was removed from the team on the same day the NCAA implemented its new policy in February. The complaint details the severe emotional distress she suffered as a result of being barred from team activities and alleges discriminatory treatment by athletic department officials.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from the South China Morning Post calls for Chinese authorities to strictly adhere to the law when investigating business figures, following a string of suspected suicides among prominent entrepreneurs. The article highlights the recent death of Hubei-based businessman Wang Zelin, who died just days after being released from detention by anti-corruption investigators. This and other similar incidents have sparked concern about the immense pressure faced by China's private sector leaders. The author argues that protecting entrepreneurs through lawful and transparent processes is crucial for supporting the country's beleaguered private sector and maintaining business confidence.</p>

          <p>Ronnie Rondell Jr., the Hollywood stuntman famously set on fire for the cover of Pink Floyd's 1975 album "Wish You Were Here," has died at the age of 88. Rondell had a prolific career spanning decades, performing stunts in numerous films and TV shows, including "Lethal Weapon," "Diamonds are Forever," and "Star Trek: First Contact."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell case, stating that the documents are not an "untapped mine lode" of new information and that the public would be "disappointed and misled." This decision has renewed questions about whether the Trump administration will release other, more substantial investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking network. Legal experts and victims' advocates argue that the Attorney General and FBI Director have the power to release these other documents, which are not protected by grand jury secrecy, but that political considerations may be preventing their disclosure.</p>
