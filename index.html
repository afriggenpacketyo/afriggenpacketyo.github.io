          <h2>Trump Suggests Possible Regime Change in Iran Following US Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 09:01:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump speculated about a potential regime change in Iran, questioning why it wouldn't occur if the current regime couldn't "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." This statement appeared to contrast with remarks from other top US officials who stated that the military action wasn't aimed at toppling Iran's leaders. The strikes followed escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with both countries accusing each other of pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. The UN's nuclear watchdog has called for a ceasefire to allow inspections, while Iran has vowed retaliation and approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route. The situation has prompted a global warning for US citizens and increased caution worldwide. </p>

          <p>ProCap Financial, led by Anthony Pompliano, has raised over $750 million and is going public through a SPAC, joining the growing trend of publicly traded bitcoin treasuries. The firm aims to hold up to $1 billion in bitcoin and generate revenue through a bitcoin-denominated financial services platform. Pompliano likened the rush into bitcoin treasuries to a bubble, stating that the trend works, despite potential risks. ProCap is among several ventures using reverse mergers to tap into public markets, indicating a surge in capital directed towards bitcoin-related investments (not investment advice). </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the US engages in military action against Iran, China's support for its ally Tehran appears to be measured, influenced by its limited influence over Israel and its strategic calculations regarding Washington's involvement. While China condemned Israel's initial actions, its rhetoric has shifted towards brokering dialogue and a ceasefire. China's economic interests lie in its access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz, but it remains cautious about direct involvement in the conflict. Some analysts suggest China might benefit from the chaos in the Middle East, as it could distract the US, while others note that China has not offered Iran material support. </p>

          <p>Despite promising to end "forever wars" overseas, President Trump has continued deploying troops in Los Angeles to address what he calls "the enemy within," referring to domestic political adversaries. The troops' presence has unnerved California's political leaders and raised concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement. Retired military officials have criticized the deployment, arguing that the military should defend the nation from foreign threats, not police American streets. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's remarks about "liberating the city from the socialists" and the arrest of elected officials have further heightened tensions, raising questions about the appropriate role of federal agencies in local governance. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Qatar has advised American citizens to shelter in place as a precautionary measure following escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. This advisory comes after the State Department issued a global warning urging U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution worldwide. Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs stated that the advisory from embassies does not reflect specific threats within the country and that the security situation is stable. The U.S. maintains a significant military presence in the Middle East, including the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which houses approximately 8,000 troops. </p>

          <p>Several tankers are reversing course away from the Strait of Hormuz due to concerns about potential closure of the vital trade route. Data indicates that at least six vessels diverted their courses, but three have since resumed heading towards the Strait. The moves follow a U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, leading to worries about electronic interference and GPS jamming. Some tanker owners may avoid the area due to increasing insurance costs and geopolitical instability. </p>

          <p>China has instructed all domestic shipping vessels traversing the Strait of Hormuz to submit daily reports with specific details, as Iran considers closing the key oil trade route. All shipping companies and ship-management firms must submit daily reports with specific details from vessels transiting not only the Hormuz but also the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. The notice was posted online by the China Shipownersâ€™ Association (CSA), which operates under the Ministry of Transport. The association said that information collected in these key regions is crucial to ensuring national interests. </p>
