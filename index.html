          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily lower U.S. drug prices, providing the company a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical tariffs in exchange for investments in domestic manufacturing. This deal has reassured the broader pharmaceutical industry, signaling a potential shift away from tariffs and setting a precedent for other companies to negotiate similar terms. As a result of the announcement, shares for Pfizer and other major drugmakers like Eli Lilly and AbbVie saw significant increases. The agreement focuses on applying 'most-favored-nation' pricing to Medicaid and new drugs, a move analysts believe is manageable for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This new offering combines the features of the $20-per-month Copilot Pro and the $12.99-per-month Microsoft 365 Family plan into a single, more integrated package. The company aims to capitalize on the growing consumer interest in generative AI tools by providing more value than standalone chat services. With 89 million consumer subscribers to Microsoft 365, this move is part of a broader strategy to accelerate revenue growth from its consumer products.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects, the Hudson River Tunnel and the Second Avenue Subway. According to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, the hold is intended to ensure that the funds are not allocated based on what the administration calls "unconstitutional DEI principles." The Department of Transportation has initiated an administrative review of the projects' contracting practices to investigate these concerns. While the funding freeze is not a direct result of the government shutdown, officials noted that the review process could be prolonged due to furloughed staff.</p>

          <p>The introduction of 'Tilly Norwood,' a fully AI-generated actor created by Dutch producer Eline Van der Velden, has triggered significant outrage within the Hollywood community. While its creator is seeking representation from talent agencies, actors and guilds like SAG-AFTRA have strongly protested, arguing that creativity should remain human-centered. Critics, including actor Sean Astin, contend that the AI character is not an actor but a computer program trained on the uncredited work of human performers. This controversy highlights the ongoing and heated debate over the role and ethical implementation of artificial intelligence in the film and entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a plan to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients, including certain artificial sweeteners and preservatives, from its private-label food brands by 2027. This initiative will impact approximately 1,000 products under brands like Great Value and is a response to consumer demand for simpler, more familiar ingredients. The move aligns with a broader industry trend, with other major companies like Kraft Heinz and General Mills also eliminating dyes. This change by the nation's largest grocer is expected to have a significant effect on the food market and reflects increasing scrutiny from both consumers and federal agencies on food additives.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident in Arerti, Ethiopia, resulted in the deaths of at least 36 people and injuries to over 200 others when makeshift scaffolding collapsed at a church during an annual religious festival. The collapse occurred while a group was visiting for the Virgin Mary festival, a significant local event. Local officials reported that some individuals remained trapped in the debris, and the most seriously injured were transported to hospitals in the capital, Addis Ababa. This event has drawn attention to the lack of stringent health and safety regulations in the country, where construction accidents are unfortunately common.</p>

Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, an investment that Buffett began building in 2022.

          <p>Over 550 celebrities, led by actor Jane Fonda, have relaunched the Committee for the First Amendment, a group originally formed in the 1940s to oppose the House Un-American Activities Committee. The new iteration aims to defend constitutional rights against what they describe as a modern campaign to silence critics in government, media, and the arts. Signatories include prominent figures like Spike Lee, Barbra Streisand, and Pedro Pascal. In a public letter, the group draws parallels between the McCarthy era's political repression and current challenges, asserting that defending free expression is a non-partisan issue requiring solidarity.</p>

          <p>England seamer Lauren Bell, 24, is set to make her 50-over World Cup debut as a key player in the team's bowling attack. In just three years, she has developed from a promising newcomer into one of the game's most in-form pace bowlers, known for her swing and strategic variations. Bell's rapid rise is a testament to her focus and mental approach, which she reinforces with homemade bracelets bearing the words "focus" and "reset." After being a traveling reserve for the 2022 tournament, she now embraces the responsibility of leading the attack as England begins its campaign against South Africa.</p>

Companies like Prevail Coffee Roasters are already testing payment apps that allow customers to pay with stablecoins, aiming to cut down on one of their most significant operational expenses. This emerging trend signals a potential disruption in the traditional payments industry, driven by the technology's promise of efficiency and lower costs.</p>

          <p>Eight months into President Trump's second term, his administration's aggressive campaign against "sanctuary" cities and states has yielded few tangible outcomes. Despite numerous lawsuits and threats of funding cuts, most targeted jurisdictions have maintained policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and court rulings have blocked attempts to withhold federal funds. The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against over a dozen Democratic-led localities, arguing their policies obstruct federal law, but only one city has reportedly altered its stance. This ongoing conflict highlights the deep political and legal divisions over immigration enforcement in the United States.</p>

While Microsoft will continue to use third-party chips that offer the best price-performance, it is actively developing its own silicon, such as the Azure Maia AI Accelerator. The strategy is part of a broader effort to optimize the entire data center system, including networking and cooling, for specific AI tasks.</p>

          <p>A recent case in Kerala involving a 16-year-old boy who was sexually assaulted by multiple men has brought attention to the taboo subject of sexual violence against male children in India. Experts and survivors state that societal pressures and traditional notions of masculinity often prevent boys and men from reporting abuse, leading to widespread underreporting. This culture of silence is compounded by a societal inability to perceive men as victims, which can lead to deep psychological challenges for survivors. Advocates are calling for greater awareness and stronger enforcement of gender-neutral laws like the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act to protect all children.</p>

          <p>A major oil workers' union in Nigeria, PENGASSAN, has called off its two-day strike at the Dangote refinery, Africa's largest, following a meeting with company management and government officials. The dispute began after the union accused the company of firing 800 workers for joining the union, a claim Dangote officials denied, stating the dismissals were part of a reorganization. Under the agreement, the strike will end while Dangote works to reassign the dismissed staff to other companies within its group without any loss of pay.

          <p>A sharp increase in mortgage rates to a three-week high caused a significant drop in mortgage application volume, which fell 12.7% last week. The decline was primarily driven by a 21% plunge in applications to refinance a home loan, as higher rates quickly erased the financial incentive for many homeowners. The average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.46%, reversing a recent trend of lower rates that had spurred a brief surge in refinancing activity.

A letter from the suspect contained a non-specific threat against the festival, prompting a thorough search of the grounds by explosives specialists.
