          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth canceled a Pentagon program promoting women's contributions to national security, despite its origin in a Trump-era law and bipartisan support.  Hegseth cited his opposition to "woke" initiatives.  The decision contradicts statements from other Trump administration officials who supported the program.
