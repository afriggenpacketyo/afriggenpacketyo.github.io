          <p>Meta's significant investments in AI, particularly the Llama models and Meta AI assistant, are under investor scrutiny as the company prepares for its first LlamaCon and quarterly earnings report. Analysts are keen to see the return on investment (ROI) from these substantial expenditures, especially with potential impacts from President Trump's tariff policies looming. While Meta is unlikely to cut its AI spending in the short term, long-term success hinges on generating sufficient revenue to justify the costs, especially as competition in the AI assistant market intensifies.

          <p>The FBI has issued a warning about hackers using a "time-traveling" technique to bypass security measures by manipulating a system's internal clock. This method involves altering the system date to a time when expired security certificates were still valid, allowing malicious software to be recognized as legitimate. The Medusa ransomware gang has notably used this technique, targeting critical infrastructure and prompting an FBI cybersecurity advisory. The FBI recommends using strong antivirus software, enabling two-factor authentication, using strong and unique passwords, monitoring for suspicious system time changes, and keeping systems updated to stay safe from Medusa malware.</p>

          <p>Tencent and Alibaba have reportedly purchased a significant number of Nvidia GPUs from ByteDance, which had previously stockpiled chips worth billions of yuan. Tencent acquired approximately 2 billion yuan worth of GPUs, primarily H20 chips, to support AI development, including its Yuanbao application. Alibaba also acquired GPUs for similar reasons, amid surging demand for computing power driven by AI adoption and tighter US export restrictions. ByteDance makes a small portion of its computing power available for sale, generating revenue for its cloud computing unit.</p>

Many lack proper training and personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling toxic debris, risking long-term health issues. Advocates fear workers are reluctant to speak out due to concerns about wage theft and potential deportation, amidst stepped-up immigration enforcement. The rush to rebuild before mega-events like the World Cup and Olympics exacerbates the problem, with some contractors bypassing formal processes and hiring day laborers without adequate protection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how countries like Japan, Chile, Mexico, and Canada have learned to live with earthquakes by implementing strategies that save lives. Japan uses early warning systems, strict building codes, and regular earthquake drills. Chile transformed its disaster policies after a devastating earthquake in 1960, focusing on building regulations and national disaster management. Mexico developed an early warning system after a tragedy in 1985, and Canada focuses on creating community response spaces. These countries demonstrate that preparation, innovation, and determination can significantly reduce the impact of earthquakes.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese economic official stated that China's food and energy security would not be compromised if it halted purchases from the US. China has diversified its food and energy imports to reduce dependence on the US, making the country less vulnerable to trade disruptions. Imports of sorghum, corn, and soybeans from the US accounted for a small share of China’s total grain consumption, and these products are highly replaceable with abundant supplies in the international market.</p>
