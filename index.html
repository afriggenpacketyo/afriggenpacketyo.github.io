          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy strongly criticized the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" at the Ryder Cup after his wife, Erica, was struck by a thrown drink from an American fan. The incident occurred on the 17th tee at Bethpage, amidst a hostile crowd that had been directing barbs at McIlroy throughout the event, leading him to "chirp back" at hecklers. Despite the challenging atmosphere, Europe secured a 15-13 victory over the United States, capping what McIlroy called "the best year of my career." He emphasized that golf should maintain higher standards of etiquette and respect, vowing to ensure such incidents are not replicated at the next Ryder Cup in Ireland.</p>

Sandu had warned of "massive Russian interference" and alleged plots of unrest, with bomb scares reported at polling stations internationally and three individuals arrested. The victory is critical for Moldova's future path towards EU integration, a sentiment echoed by many citizens concerned about the war in neighboring Ukraine and seeking stability and economic growth. This article underscores the significant geopolitical stakes and domestic tensions that characterized the electoral process, reinforcing the country's Western alignment despite opposition calls for protests.</p>

On a BBC podcast, Rooney described the club as "broken" and expressed that he now expects them to lose matches. Following a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, which left United 14th in the Premier League, Rooney called for significant changes in management and players, arguing that some players "don't deserve to wear the shirt." He also criticized the club's ownership, the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, for a lack of clear direction, indicating the club's culture has deteriorated.</p>

          <h2>US Ryder Cup Captain Keegan Bradley Demands Change to "Envelope Rule" After European Victory</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United States Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley has called for a change to the "envelope rule" before the 2027 contest, following Europe's 15-13 victory. This rule dictates that if a player withdraws due to injury, a designated opponent also sits out, with both teams awarded half a point for that match. The situation arose when Europe's Viktor Hovland was forced to pull out with a neck injury, automatically making the score 12-5 before the singles matches even began. Bradley argues the rule is unfair and needs revision, especially given the US team's desperate need for every possible point during their remarkable, though ultimately unsuccessful, comeback attempt.</p>

          <p>An opinion article critically reviews Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," asserting it exposes a politician focused on political machinery and presentation rather than substantive convictions or distinct values. The author suggests the book highlights a "formidable lack of self-awareness" within Harris and the Democratic establishment, failing to acknowledge deeper reasons for her campaign's struggles beyond external factors. The article contends that Harris's approach, prioritizing celebrity endorsements and continuity with an unpopular Joe Biden, was a "farce" that ultimately failed to connect with voters outside a political bubble. This critique suggests a persistent delusion within the party, hindering its ability to mount a meaningful challenge to Trump now and Trumpism in the future.</p>

This prediction comes as China's economic momentum slows, with year-on-year growth projected to fall sharply towards 4% from a high base last year. The People’s Bank of China recently maintained a dovish bias in its policy meeting, subtly shifting its economic outlook to a more cautious phrase, suggesting a more conservative view on the economy's health.

          <p>Regulators are struggling to keep pace with the rapid development of AI therapy apps, leading to a patchwork of state laws in the absence of stronger federal oversight. States like Illinois and Nevada have banned AI for mental health treatment, while Utah has set limits on chatbots, requiring disclosure that they are not human. Many laws, however, do not cover generic chatbots used for therapy, some of which have been linked to severe user harm and even suicide. Mental health advocates emphasize the critical need for comprehensive federal regulation to ensure safety, expert input, and human monitoring, especially given the nationwide shortage of mental health providers that these apps aim to address.</p>

This trend allows smaller enterprises to secure prime commercial spaces once out of reach, often with more favorable terms like flexible leases and rent-free periods, though rental rates are still rising, albeit slower.

Psychologist Suzy Reading identifies common signs as an excessive need for attention and reassurance, or subtly chipping away at one's mood through backhanded compliments. Author Radhika Sanghani suggests that how one feels after an interaction is a key indicator. The article provides three strategies for managing such friendships: honest communication about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries regarding time and topics, and changing shared activities like walks to reduce their tendency to dominate conversations.</p>
