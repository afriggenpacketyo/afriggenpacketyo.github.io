          <p>The UK government has signed an agreement with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence in public services like education, defense, and justice. This non-binding deal aims to boost productivity and economic growth, with OpenAI expanding its London office. The partnership will also focus on developing safeguards to protect public data and democratic values, though it has drawn criticism from groups concerned about the unlicensed use of creative works for training AI models.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with former minister Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a prominent role. The changes are described as part of the party's policy renewal and an effort to project unity. This move comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership, during which the party has struggled in opinion polls and faced poor local election results. A Labour source dismissed the reshuffle as a sign of panic, suggesting it involves the same figures from the previous government.</p>

          <p>An exhibition at the National Museum of Ireland is showcasing 1,300-year-old manuscripts featuring doodles and notes from early medieval Irish monks. These scribbles, found in the margins of a 6th-century grammar book, offer a rare glimpse into the monks' daily lives, including complaints about hangovers, bad weather, and poor-quality ink. The notes, written in Old Irish, also express anxieties about Viking raids, providing a humanizing look at monastic life. The exhibit, on loan from Switzerland's Abbey Library of St. Gall, highlights the personal and humorous side of these historical figures.</p>

With the current IMF program expiring in 2027, the new financing is crucial.

          <p>The UK government borrowed £20.7 billion in June, a figure higher than anticipated and £6.6 billion more than the same month last year. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase to higher public service spending and soaring debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation. This rise in borrowing is the second-highest for June on record, surpassed only by June 2020 during the pandemic. Analysts suggest this puts additional pressure on the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and makes tax increases in the upcoming autumn Budget increasingly likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of global film distribution highlights the common practice of altering Hollywood movies to comply with censorship rules in various countries. In India, for instance, a kiss in "Superman" was shortened, while in China, an alternate ending was created for "Minions: The Rise of Gru" to show the villain facing justice. Other countries like Russia and Egypt have removed scenes depicting homosexuality, while Turkey blurs alcohol and cigarettes. This censorship is sometimes done by local distributors or even by Hollywood studios themselves to gain access to lucrative but restrictive markets like China.</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Italy in the Euro 2025 semi-finals, analysis highlights Italy as a potential dark horse capable of causing an upset. Italy's impressive run to their first semi-final in 28 years has been led by captain Cristiana Girelli and supported by a tactically flexible approach under coach Andrea Soncin. Experts suggest Italy may target England's potential weaknesses in the wide defensive areas, a strategy that proved successful in their quarter-final win. While England are considered favorites, Italy's confidence and ability to capitalize on opponents' mistakes make them a dangerous adversary.</p>

This "tariff tango" approach, influenced by trade disputes of the 1980s, allows for rapid pressure but has been criticized for potentially stoking inflation and destabilizing global trade.

          <p>In a personal essay, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the tendency of Western publishers to seek out stories from Balkan authors that focus on political trauma, war, and regional tragedy. She recounts being advised by a U.S. publisher to write about themes "specific to your culture," implying a preference for stories with explanatory or didactic value about the region's troubled history. Schnabl argues this expectation limits Balkan writers to producing self-exoticizing work and reinforces stereotypes, preventing a wider range of universal human stories from the region from being told. She calls for publishers to embrace a greater diversity of voices beyond those that fit preconceived notions.</p>
