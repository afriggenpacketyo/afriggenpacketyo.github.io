        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's claims about declining egg prices are being challenged by food economists who state that retail egg prices have actually increased during his term. While wholesale egg prices have decreased, the benefit has not yet been fully passed on to consumers, according to experts. The average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, marking a 25% increase. Economists attribute the recent surge in retail egg prices to the avian flu outbreak, which has decimated the egg supply, and emphasize that a president exerts minimal influence over day-to-day egg costs.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is reportedly discouraging further Democrat trips to El Salvador related to the deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, signaling growing internal divisions over border security. Progressives have championed Abrego Garcia's case, while moderates express unease due to his alleged ties to the MS-13 gang. Concerns are rising that focusing on this case could politically backfire. Despite Jeffries' previous demands for Abrego Garcia's return, he has not publicly supported sending congressional delegations to El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Both the US and Ukraine have indicated they are close to finalizing a deal that would grant American firms access to Ukraine's mineral resources. The agreement involves the creation of a joint investment fund to search for minerals in Ukraine and outlines how revenues will be divided. However, last-minute negotiations are ongoing, with the US side seeking compliance with previously agreed-upon terms. Technical documents have already been signed by representatives from both countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that semaglutide, the active compound in the weight-loss drug Wegovy, may be effective in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a severe form of liver disease. A study involving 800 adults with MASH showed that nearly 63% of those receiving semaglutide injections experienced a clearing of fat and inflammation in their livers without worsening of liver scarring. Novo Nordisk, the drug's manufacturer, has sought FDA approval for Wegovy as a MASH treatment, with Eli Lilly also exploring similar applications for their drugs. There is only one medication currently approved to treat the condition, Rezdiffra, which the F.D.A. cleared last March.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering whether Oklahoma can use government funds to operate a Catholic charter school, raising questions about the separation of church and state. The case centers on St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which aims to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. Justices appear divided, with Republican appointees largely supportive and Democratic appointees wary. A ruling in favor of the school could lead to the expansion of religious charter schools nationwide.</p>

The federal government's debt is growing, leading to higher interest payments, and much of the attempted cost-cutting has focused on smaller targets outside of these major areas.</p>
