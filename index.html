          <p>President Trump met with conservative House members to garner support for the budget package, which contains his second-term agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson aims to hold a vote on the bill, which includes concessions to fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans, either Wednesday night or Thursday morning. The legislation faces opposition from both conservative members seeking steeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans concerned about the state and local tax deduction. The bill is estimated to add trillions to the deficit over the next decade, further complicating its path to passage.</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including the state's "EV mandate" requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could impact 16 other states and D.C. that have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>Southern California experienced a heat wave this week, with temperatures reaching the low 90s. The Weather Service's heat advisory expired Wednesday, and cooler temperatures are expected as a low-pressure system sweeps into the region, bringing back May gray. The return of onshore breezes will create persistent cloud cover, potentially affecting Memorial Day weekend beach weather. Despite the heat, recent rains have lowered the risk of widespread wildfires, though officials urge residents to prepare for the upcoming fire season.</p>
