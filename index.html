          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars is altering its U.S. strategy due to tariff impacts, announcing plans to produce its best-selling XC60 SUV at its South Carolina factory starting in 2026. Simultaneously, the company is reducing its offering of sedans and station wagons in the American market because of waning interest and unfavorable trade conditions. Despite reporting a significant year-on-year decline in second-quarter operating profit, the figures exceeded analyst predictions, causing the company's shares to rise. This strategic pivot aims to better utilize U.S. manufacturing assets and navigate the challenging economic environment.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party is formally assessing comments made by veteran MP Diane Abbott, who recently stated she does not regret a 2023 letter that led to her suspension. In the letter, she suggested that Jewish, Irish, and Traveller people experience a different form of prejudice than racism based on skin color, a position she reiterated in a new interview. The party, which had previously disciplined her for antisemitism, stated it takes the new remarks "incredibly seriously." Abbott maintains she was highlighting the different ways racism is experienced, not creating a hierarchy of suffering.</p>

          <p>A report from China's state-run Science and Technology Daily has raised concerns about a potential glut in the country's artificial intelligence infrastructure. The article highlights that while nearly 150 intelligent computing centers are operational and another 400 are planned, many existing facilities are already running idle. This trend of "blind investment" is leading to a significant waste of resources and market imbalances. The warning comes as China prepares for the return of Nvidia's H20 chip, suggesting the risk of underutilized computing power could worsen without better strategic planning.</p>

          <p>China is bracing for significant employment challenges as a record number of university students are scheduled to graduate and enter the labor market this season. Although the youth unemployment rate saw a slight decrease in June, it remains higher than the previous year, indicating persistent pressure. Officials from the national statistics bureau have acknowledged the increased employment strain on key demographics, including young people and migrant workers. This situation suggests a difficult job-hunting period ahead for new graduates, echoing the sharp rise in youth unemployment seen during the same period in 2024.</p>

          <p>For seven decades, since Disneyland first opened, The Walt Disney Company has successfully leveraged its vast portfolio of intellectual property to fuel its theme parks, a strategy that remains a core profit driver. The experiences division, which includes parks and resorts, consistently outperforms other segments, thanks to attractions based on stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. CEO Bob Iger's acquisitions have been central to this, allowing the company to create immersive lands like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. Disney plans to invest $60 billion in experiences over the next decade, focusing heavily on IP-driven attractions.</p>

          <p>Automaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced plans to cut up to 500 management jobs in the UK through a voluntary redundancy program. The company attributes the move to challenging global conditions, including pressure on sales and profits from U.S. trade tariffs. This decision follows a recent report of decreased sales, partly due to a pause in U.S. exports and the phasing out of older Jaguar models. While the UK government asserts that a recent trade deal saved jobs, industry experts suggest the increased tariff rates are a significant factor in JLR's decision to reduce its workforce.</p>

          <p>For decades, Russ Miller, known as the "River Cowboy," has led a grassroots effort to remove thousands of discarded tires from Kentucky's rivers, particularly the Red River Gorge. The article highlights the pervasive problem of illegal tire dumping, with an estimated one million tires going unaccounted for in the state each year. Miller and volunteer groups like Friends of Red River conduct grueling cleanups, pulling hundreds of tires from the scenic waterways. The piece explores the cultural and logistical reasons for the dumping and notes recent legislative action aimed at addressing the large-scale pollution.</p>

Wang Puzhong, head of Meituan's local commerce, stated the company felt compelled to join the fight against rivals Alibaba and JD.com to avoid appearing weak, even as the deep discounts disconnect from business fundamentals. The battle for market share has intensified, expanding from food to on-demand groceries, with all three companies offering massive subsidies to attract consumers, a strategy Wang believes will lead to significant losses for all competitors.</p>

This move is designed to create a more age-appropriate experience and retain older users on the platform.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of recent Supreme Court dissents argues that the three liberal justices—Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—are signaling that the conservative majority is no longer abiding by established legal principles. Their writings increasingly portray a majority unbound by precedent, reason, or facts, effectively abandoning the traditional game of constitutional law. The article suggests these dissents are not just routine disagreements but urgent warnings about the Court's legitimacy. By highlighting the majority's alleged lawlessness and complicity in wrongdoing, the liberal wing is screaming that a fundamental shift has occurred.</p>

          <p>Despite an apparent political resurgence on the international stage, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is on the verge of collapse internally. His coalition has lost its majority, now controlling just 50 of 120 parliamentary seats, after key partners from ultra-Orthodox and far-right factions have withdrawn support. The unraveling is due to deeply divisive issues, including military draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox and the far-right's opposition to ending the war in Gaza. Netanyahu is now leading a de facto minority government, likely heading towards new elections in early 2026.</p>

          <p>This article explores the rising appeal of foldable smartphones, suggesting they represent a meaningful evolution in a market dominated by static glass slabs for over a decade. Initially dismissed as clunky and expensive, newer models like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 offer improved functionality, adapting between a compact phone and a larger tablet-like screen. This form factor is seen as a bridge to future technologies, offering a practical alternative to still-developing AR glasses and AI pins. The trend, reminiscent of the old flip phone, suggests the smartphone will remain our primary gadget for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, even as the company experienced a decline in demand for its food and beverage products in North America. The company's worldwide volume for food fell by 1.5%, while its North American beverage volume dropped by 2%. Despite this, the company reiterated its full-year outlook, citing cost-cutting measures, improved efficiencies, and a strategic focus on multicultural products and the protein trend to boost domestic sales. The positive report led to a roughly 2% rise in the company's premarket stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the political and legal reasons behind the public controversy over the so-called "Epstein Files." Despite widespread calls for their release, a longstanding Department of Justice policy prevents the disclosure of closed investigative files, partly to protect uncharged individuals. Attorney General Pam Bondi's contradictory statements have fueled confusion, first suggesting a "client list" was on her desk and later supporting a memo stating no such list exists. The author suggests that neither Bondi nor President Trump is likely to release the full, unredacted files, despite political pressure from their own supporters.</p>
