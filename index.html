          <p>Tax returns for Illinois Governor JB Pritzker show he and his wife reported nearly $10.7 million in total income for 2024, which included over $1.4 million from gambling.

The governor, who is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, plans to donate the full amount of his winnings to charitable causes.

          <p>Democratic Senator Mark Kelly has called for President Donald Trump to engage directly in negotiations to end the ongoing government shutdown, now in its third week. Kelly argues that Republican leaders in the House and Senate seem to follow the president's lead, making his involvement essential for a resolution. The primary point of contention remains the Democratic demand to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are set to expire. Republicans have indicated a willingness to discuss the subsidies, but only after the government is reopened.</p>

          <p>An immigration barrister in the United Kingdom is facing a potential disciplinary investigation after a judge discovered he used an AI tool like ChatGPT for legal research. The barrister, Chowdhury Rahman, submitted an asylum appeal that cited multiple cases that were either entirely fictitious or irrelevant to the matter. The judge noted that Rahman seemed unfamiliar with the cases he cited and likely used generative AI to formulate his arguments. The judge is now considering reporting the barrister to the Bar Standards Board for misleading the court and wasting its time.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to present a criminal case against former national security adviser John Bolton to a grand jury. The case stems from an investigation into his handling of classified documents, which included an FBI search of his home and office in August. Bolton, who served under President Trump, has previously denied any wrongdoing regarding classified information, particularly in relation to his tell-all book, "The Room Where It Happened." The Biden administration had previously closed a similar investigation into Bolton without pressing charges.</p>

          <p>Japan endured its hottest summer ever recorded in 2025, with average temperatures 2.36 degrees Celsius above normal, fueling fears about the long-term impacts of global warming. Experts attribute the extreme heat to a combination of climate change, high ocean surface temperatures, and persistent high-pressure systems. The trend of increasingly hot summers poses serious risks to Japan's agriculture, fishing industry, and public health, with over 100,000 people hospitalized for heatstroke. Scientists warn that Japan's spring and autumn seasons are contracting and could disappear within 30 years if current warming trends continue.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are closely monitoring the congressional debate over Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, as their potential expiration after 2025 could significantly affect retirement tax planning. The expanded subsidies currently allow for larger Roth IRA conversions without losing eligibility for health insurance premium support. If these subsidies expire, the income threshold for support would be much lower, potentially forcing retirees to choose between smaller Roth conversions or paying much higher health insurance premiums. This uncertainty complicates long-term financial strategies for those nearing or in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the popularity of low-premium Medicare Advantage plans, many seniors continue to choose Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, for their healthcare coverage. The primary reasons for this preference include the freedom to see any doctor or specialist who accepts Medicare nationwide, without network restrictions or referral requirements. Medigap also offers more predictable out-of-pocket costs and fewer administrative hurdles like prior authorizations, which can be crucial for those with chronic conditions.

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in the U.S. that will allow its drivers and couriers to earn money by completing small online jobs directly through the app. These tasks, which can be done when not transporting passengers or food, include work like uploading photos or recording voice prompts to help train artificial intelligence models. The initiative is part of a series of updates based on feedback from workers. Pay for these tasks will vary based on their complexity and estimated completion time, offering drivers an additional way to generate income.</p>

          <p>Cardiff is set to become one of the first UK cities to charge drivers of heavier vehicles, such as SUVs, more for residential parking permits. The city council's cabinet approved a new 10-year parking plan that introduces a surcharge for vehicles weighing over 2.4 tonnes. The initiative aims to reduce congestion and air pollution by encouraging the use of smaller, less polluting vehicles. While the plan also creates new permits for carers and NHS workers, it has drawn mixed reactions, with some tradespeople and residents concerned about being unfairly penalized.</p>

          <p>The head of MI5, Sir Ken McCallum, has stated that Chinese state operatives pose a daily national security threat to the UK and expressed frustration over the recent collapse of a high-profile espionage case. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case against two men accused of spying for China, leading to questions about the government's handling of the matter. McCallum affirmed that MI5 had operationally disrupted the alleged activity. The incident has sparked a political row, with the Conservative opposition accusing the government of appeasing China to protect economic relations.</p>

A spokesman for the Indian government stated he was "not aware" of any such conversation taking place between the two leaders. The U.S. has been pressuring India to cease its Russian oil imports to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin over the war in Ukraine. India, which buys Russian crude at a discount, has become a critical energy customer for Moscow since the 2022 invasion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from JPMorgan suggests that the common goal of saving $1 million for retirement is unrealistic for most Americans and that a more tailored approach is needed. The bank's analysis indicates that retirement savings targets should be based on a household's income, with the goal of replacing a certain percentage of pre-retirement earnings. For example, a household earning $90,000 annually would need around $700,000 by age 65 to maintain their lifestyle. This income-replacement model offers more achievable benchmarks compared to an arbitrary seven-figure target. (not investment advice)</p>

The new technology reportedly overcomes this significant challenge.
