          <p>Broadcom's stock value increased by over 9% after the company announced a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips. While the customer was not officially named, multiple financial analysts believe it to be the AI startup OpenAI, based on previous reports and the scale of the deal. This significant order has prompted Broadcom to raise its AI revenue forecast for the upcoming year, when shipments are set to begin. The news underscores the company's growing prominence alongside Nvidia in the competitive AI hardware market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The sudden resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has raised questions, particularly as it coincides with the Trump administration's campaign against her former colleague, Lisa Cook. A review of Kugler's real estate records reveals inconsistencies regarding her primary residence, though she attributes this to a county clerical error. The vacancy created by her departure allows President Trump to appoint a successor, furthering his goal of gaining more influence over the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching EU competition laws by abusing its dominance in the online advertising technology sector. Regulators found that Google unfairly favored its own ad exchange, AdX, over rivals, leading to higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers. Google has called the decision "wrong" and plans to appeal, while the Trump administration criticized the fine as "very unfair" to an American company. The EU has given Google 60 days to detail how it will change its practices.</p>

          <p>The large, three-dimensional "LAX" sign at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport is being temporarily dismantled to accommodate a major roadway reconstruction project. The initiative aims to improve traffic flow and accessibility by creating elevated roadways and more direct access to parking, reducing congestion on Sepulveda Boulevard. The iconic letters will be stored and later relocated upon completion of the project, which is part of a broader modernization effort ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Summer Olympics.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock price dropped by 20% after the company significantly lowered its full-year earnings forecast, attributing a large part of the revision to the financial impact of tariffs. The athletic apparel retailer now projects a $240 million hit to its profits for the year. The company's CEO also acknowledged that its product offerings, particularly in casual wear, have become "stale" and are not resonating with customers in the U.S. market. To address these issues, Lululemon plans to refresh its product lines and increase the proportion of new styles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again suggested he is considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of actress and longtime critic Rosie O'Donnell. In a post on his social media platform, Trump called her "not a Great American" and shared a doctored photo of her. This repeats a similar threat he made earlier in the summer. O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland citing the political climate in the U.S., responded on Instagram by referencing the TV show "Succession." The feud between the two public figures dates back many years.</p>

          <p>President Trump has raised the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states, was controversially capped in the 2017 tax law to offset other tax cuts. Proponents argued the move helps reduce double taxation for residents in states like New York and California. However, budget analysts estimate that raising the cap will significantly increase the national debt by over $142 billion over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public health experts are raising alarms as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. systematically dismantles the nation's vaccine infrastructure, leading to a breakdown in decades of synchronized health policy. By dismissing the entire CDC advisory panel (ACIP) and replacing it with anti-vaccine figures, Kennedy has eroded trust in federal guidance. In response, several states are forming their own coalitions to issue independent vaccine recommendations. This fragmentation threatens to create a patchwork of conflicting health policies, weaken national defense against disease, and could take generations to repair.</p>

          <p>President Trump is planning to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," arguing the original name sounds stronger and reflects a time when the U.S. "used to win wars." The name change would require congressional approval to be official, but the move signals a symbolic shift in the administration's posture. Historians note the department was named "Defense" in 1947 to reflect a post-WWII focus on deterring major conflicts in the nuclear age, not just waging them. Critics worry the change implies a more bellicose foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Investigators have identified a deceased Navy diver, Sean Patrick McNulty, as the perpetrator in at least six cold case home invasion and sexual assault incidents from the 1980s and 90s. The breakthrough came after DNA from two 1980s Ventura County cases was matched and then linked through a genealogical investigation to other cases in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. McNulty died by suicide in 1997 after becoming a suspect in one of the cases. Authorities confirmed the DNA match using a biological sample collected before his death, bringing closure to some victims.</p>
