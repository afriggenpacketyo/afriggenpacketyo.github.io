        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing surged to £20.2 billion in September, the highest for that month in five years, according to official figures. This significant increase, £1.6 billion more than the previous year, is largely driven by escalating debt interest payments and inflation-linked rises in state benefits and government operational costs. These challenging financial statistics place considerable pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is anticipated to implement tax increases in the forthcoming November Budget to meet her self-imposed fiscal targets. With public sector debt now at 95.3% of gross domestic product, a level not observed since the early 1960s, the government is reiterating its commitment to bring down borrowing.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's co-author, Amy Wallace, conveyed that Giuffre would perceive Prince Andrew's voluntary decision to cease using his titles as a significant victory. Giuffre's posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," details her allegations of sexual assault by Prince Andrew, claims he has consistently denied. Wallace, who collaborated with Giuffre for four years before her passing, highlighted that Andrew could still assist investigators by disclosing information about his time within Jeffrey Epstein's network. This relinquishment of titles, including Duke of York, is considered a symbolic yet crucial step towards holding powerful individuals accountable for their past actions related to sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Two survivors of grooming gangs, Fiona Goddard and Ellie-Ann Reynolds, have resigned from the national inquiry's victims' liaison panel, raising serious concerns about the process. Goddard specifically criticized the shortlisted chairs, a former police chief and a social worker, arguing they represent a conflict of interest given past institutional failures in addressing such abuse. She also cited "condescending and controlling language" directed at survivors. The Home Office has committed to a thorough inquiry, denying any attempt to water it down and pledging to collect ethnicity data on perpetrators. Critics, including shadow ministers, are now advocating for a senior judge to lead the investigation to ensure impartiality and restore public trust.</p>

          <p>A collaborative research effort between scientists from South China University of Technology and Flinders University in Australia has identified a crucial cellular weakness in prostate cancer. The team discovered two specific protein enzymes that are essential for the growth, survival, and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. This groundbreaking research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, sheds light on a key mechanism that regulates the androgen receptor protein, which is known to fuel the disease. This discovery offers a promising pathway for developing new therapeutic strategies to combat prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>Australian scientists exploring the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia have unveiled approximately 20 new deep-sea species, with an estimated 600 more awaiting formal description. Notable discoveries include the West Australian Lantern Shark, a bioluminescent creature up to 40cm long with a distinctive glowing belly, found over 600 meters beneath the ocean's surface. Another intriguing find is a new type of porcelain crab, measuring about 1.5cm, which utilizes specialized hairs for filter feeding instead of traditional claws, dwelling at around 122 meters below sea level. These ongoing discoveries underscore the immense and largely unexplored biodiversity within Australia's vast marine environments.</p>

          <p>Liverpool faces significant challenges under manager Arne Slot, having suffered four consecutive defeats and falling to fourth in the Premier League. The article highlights concerns about the team's vulnerability in defense, lethargic midfield, and toothless attack, despite substantial investment in new players. Key issues include Mohamed Salah's uncharacteristic goal drought and diminished confidence, as well as the struggles of expensive signings like Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz to integrate effectively. Defensive frailties, particularly with full-backs and set-pieces, have led to a sharp increase in goals conceded, prompting questions about Slot's best starting XI and tactical approach to regain stability.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight was forced to divert to Salt Lake City after an unidentified object struck its windshield at 36,000 feet, causing it to crack and injure the pilot. WindBorne Systems, a weather balloon company, has indicated that the object might have been one of their balloons and is collaborating with authorities on the investigation. The company has swiftly implemented operational adjustments to reduce high-altitude flight time and is developing new hardware to mitigate potential impact forces. Aviation experts consider such an incident at this altitude highly unusual, ruling out common occurrences like bird strikes.

          <p>Brazil's government has granted state-run oil giant Petrobras a license to commence oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River, a decision that has drawn immediate and fierce criticism from environmental activists. This approval comes after a five-year dispute, with the environmental agency IBAMA having previously rejected a similar application. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva supports the project, arguing that the oil revenue will help fund Brazil's climate transition efforts. However, environmental groups denounce the move as "sabotage" to the upcoming COP30 climate talks and a dangerous expansion of fossil fuel extraction, warning of potential ecological impacts on the Amazon rainforest and indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>New court documents filed by James Comey's legal team have identified "Person 3" in the Department of Justice's charges against the former FBI director as Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and close associate. Comey faces charges of making false statements during a 2020 Senate hearing regarding his authorization of leaks. His attorneys contend that the prosecution is "vindictive," fueled by President Trump's animosity, and that the indictment misrepresents the scope of Senator Ted Cruz's original questioning, which primarily concerned Andrew McCabe. Comey plans to argue for dismissal based on a "literal truth" defense, asserting the indictment misquotes him.</p>

The article highlights Collins's journey from childhood aspiration to achieving her groundbreaking career, emphasizing her dedication to establishing a strong reputation for women in aviation. She humorously noted that being a parent was more challenging than commanding a Space Shuttle, preparing her for leadership. The article also touches on her resilience in leading the mission following the Columbia disaster, including a risky 360-degree flip maneuver in space to inspect her craft for damage.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a US fugitive who faked his own death and escaped to Scotland, has been sentenced to a minimum of five years in prison for sexual assault in Utah. The 38-year-old was convicted in two separate trials for sexually assaulting two women in 2008. Judge Barry G Lawrence characterized Rossi as a "serial abuser of women" and a significant "flight risk" due to his past actions. Rossi, who had assumed the alias Arthur Knight and consistently denied his identity, was apprehended in a Glasgow hospital in 2021 and subsequently extradited to the United States in January 2024 to face justice.</p>
