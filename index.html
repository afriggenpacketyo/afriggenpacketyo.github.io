          <p>Actress Mandy Moore publicly condemned a driver who allegedly rear-ended her family's vehicle and then fled the scene, an incident she detailed on social media. While Moore confirmed that everyone was thankfully unharmed, she expressed fury over the driver's actions, questioning what kind of human behaves that way. This hit-and-run adds to a series of recent challenges for Moore and her family, including their home being damaged in California wildfires and subsequent frustrations with bureaucratic delays in rebuilding. The article notes this event is the latest in a string of difficulties for the actress.</p>

          <p>Over three decades after the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, leaving a lasting scar on the community. The investigation saw multiple suspects and even two convictions that were later overturned on constitutional grounds after a new DNA test did not match the accused. One of the men had confessed to sexually assaulting a victim, a confession he later said was coerced. Despite the passage of time and the emotional toll on everyone involved, investigators and families hold onto hope that advancements in DNA technology may finally bring closure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a method for drone swarms to conduct sophisticated electronic warfare. By coordinating their signals, the drones can jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating an "eye of the storm," a protected area where friendly signals are unaffected. This targeted approach represents a significant advancement over traditional, indiscriminate jamming techniques that disrupt all signals in an area. The technology aims to provide a strategic advantage by disabling adversaries without causing friendly fire in the electromagnetic spectrum, enhancing the PLA's capabilities.</p>

          <p>Singer Justin Timberlake has announced that he was diagnosed with Lyme disease, an illness he described as potentially "implacably debilitating, both mentally and physically." In a social media post, he shared that he considered ending his recent tour but decided the joy of performing outweighed the physical stress he was experiencing. While the future of his stage career is uncertain, he expressed deep gratitude for his family's unconditional love and support. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that can cause a range of symptoms, and while often treatable, it can lead to persistent health issues for some individuals.</p>

          <p>Shayna Glassman, whose late father was terrorized by his neighbor David Berkowitz, the "Son of Sam" serial killer, has been visiting and corresponding with the infamous murderer in prison. Her father, Craig Glassman, had reported Berkowitz for harassment just before his 1977 arrest and was even mentioned in the killer's threatening letters. Shayna, who was only four when her father died, says that connecting with Berkowitz is her way of processing her father's legacy and the story he left behind. She describes their relationship as complex but not romantic, finding a strange connection to the man who once targeted her family.</p>

          <p>Recent films depicting the Nanking Massacre have renewed reflection in China, particularly among younger generations, about the historical trauma that continues to shape the nation's identity and foreign policy. The author argues that for many Chinese citizens, the 1937 atrocity is more than a historical event; it is a profound moral wound that has never been adequately acknowledged or atoned for by the Japanese government. This legacy of suffering and remembrance is deeply embedded in the cultural consciousness, explaining its potent symbolism. The article reflects on the personal and collective pain associated with the event.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly rejected a potential deal with Senate Democrats, telling Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to "go to hell" on social media. The negotiations aimed to confirm a slate of Trump's nominees in exchange for concessions, including the release of certain federal funds and an agreement not to pursue further budget cuts. The breakdown in talks occurred after Trump characterized the Democrats' demands as "egregious," urging Republicans to reject the offer. As a result, the Senate was expected to enter its August recess without a broad agreement on the stalled nominations, highlighting ongoing political gridlock.</p>

Her case drew attention due to her husband's military service and an old, unknown deportation order issued against her and her estranged mother.

While co-founder Vitalik Buterin celebrates its success, he also cautions against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption grows.

The court agreed that factors like ethnicity, language, or location alone do not constitute grounds for a stop, as they violate the Fourth Amendment.

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million. This development comes as the club continues to show interest in signing RB Leipzig's forward Benjamin Sesko. Although Hojlund recently expressed his desire to stay at United, the potential arrival of another striker would likely marginalize his role. Selling Hojlund would represent a book loss for the club, but sources indicate that player exits would be necessary to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules, especially after significant summer spending on other players.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more careful with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts sharply with China, where a vibrant and competitive open-source AI ecosystem is rapidly advancing, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI recently releasing powerful new models. Stanford professor Andrew Ng has praised China's "Darwinian" environment, suggesting it could be the path for the country to surpass the U.S. in AI development. The divergence highlights a strategic split in how the world's tech giants are approaching AI's future.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, offering them a personal commitment from himself and President Trump to work for their release. The meeting in Tel Aviv occurred amid growing fears for the captives' survival, nearly 22 months into the war, and recent Hamas propaganda videos showing hostages in poor condition. Witkoff reportedly told the families they would work to get their children home and hold Hamas accountable. The meeting took place as families protested to urge the Israeli government to push harder for a deal to free their loved ones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II died en route to the UK. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943, but perished in the final days of its voyage. While wartime rumors blamed the animal's death on shell-shock from a nearby German U-boat, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Logbooks from the platypus's attendant show that as the ship crossed the equator, water and air temperatures soared well above the safe threshold for the species, indicating the creature likely died from heat stress.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of large-scale theme parks to stimulate its economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest addition to a rapidly growing attractions industry, which is forecast to expand by 19% annually over the next three years. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, these attractions act as significant economic drivers for local economies. The trend reflects a broader strategy to encourage domestic tourism and consumption as a pillar of economic growth in the post-pandemic era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carol Mason's new book, "From the Clinics to the Capitol: How Opposing Abortion Became Insurrectionary," traces the evolution of the anti-abortion movement and its increasing links to far-right extremism. In an interview, Mason discusses how the tactics and ideologies developed in the decades-long fight against abortion have converged with broader insurrectionary politics. The book argues that the movement's history of direct action, confrontational rhetoric, and challenges to state authority provided a blueprint for other forms of political extremism. It examines how this single-issue cause became intertwined with a wider anti-government and nationalist agenda.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise or facilitate illegal Channel crossings. The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could lead to up to five years in prison for those creating online material that promotes illegal immigration services, such as selling fake documents or promising passage on small boats. Home Office analysis suggests that around 80% of migrants arriving by boat used social media to contact smugglers. The measure aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt the business models of criminal gangs.</p>

Criminal organizations are cashing in on the craze by quickly producing cheap, low-quality knock-offs that may also contain toxic materials. The high demand and limited supply of genuine dolls, which are often bought in bulk by resellers, have created a fertile ground for the illicit counterfeit trade.</p>
