          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that the fuel supply to both engines was manually cut off moments after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot questioning the other about the action, though the other pilot denied doing it. While one engine began to recover, the second did not, leading to the crash that killed 270 people. The report suggests the incident was not due to a mechanical failure with the Boeing 787 aircraft or its engines.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing him of overseeing an "ostentatious" and potentially unlawful office renovation. This new line of attack comes amid President Trump's ongoing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates, which he believes would stimulate the economy. Powell has defended the renovation, stating that descriptions of its lavishness are inaccurate and that the project is necessary for the aging headquarters. The conflict highlights the tension between the White House and the traditionally independent central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ashley Williams, a long-serving aide to former President Joe Biden, underwent nearly six hours of closed-door questioning by House Republican investigators. The probe, led by the House Oversight Committee, is examining allegations that senior aides concealed Biden's cognitive health issues and whether presidential orders were signed by autopen without his knowledge. A source familiar with the interview claimed Williams frequently stated she could not recall specific details, though she affirmed that Biden remains fit for the presidency. This interview is part of a broader Republican-led investigation into the former president's fitness for office.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the South China Sea arbitration ruling, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has restated Beijing's firm rejection of the decision. Speaking at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Wang described the 2016 ruling, which favored the Philippines, as a "farce" that was manipulated by external powers to destabilize the region. He emphasized China's commitment to maintaining regional stability and accelerating negotiations for a binding code of conduct with ASEAN nations. This statement comes amid renewed tensions in the contested maritime area.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data and a stark report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) signal growing economic challenges for the United Kingdom. The OBR warned that the UK faces "daunting" fiscal risks, with government debt potentially soaring if current spending promises are maintained without adjustments. This has set a difficult stage for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is expected to announce significant tax rises of £10-20 billion in the autumn Budget to stabilize public finances. The combination of slowing growth, high borrowing costs, and global economic uncertainty creates a challenging environment for the new government. (not investment advice)</p>

This assertion of an independent course comes as his government navigates criticism over the AUKUS security pact and defense spending.

Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will invoke its reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war between the two nations.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, a major escalation in trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners.

The move is part of a broader strategy of imposing higher tariffs on numerous countries to correct trade imbalances.

          <p>Mexican music star Pepe Aguilar has released a new version of the song “Corrido de Juanito” to support the immigrant community in Los Angeles amid increased federal enforcement actions. Aguilar announced that all proceeds from the single, as well as his latest album, will be donated to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA). The song's lyrics explore the emotional hardship and dignity of the immigrant experience, a message Aguilar felt was timely and important. He stated he is using his art to peacefully resist what he sees as an unfair situation for millions of people.</p>

          <p>A review of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation has reportedly caused a significant clash within the Department of Justice between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. The conflict arose over the public rollout of the review's findings, which concluded Epstein died by suicide and that no incriminating "client list" was found. This conclusion frustrated some who expected bombshell revelations, and the subsequent fallout led to a confrontation at the White House. Sources indicate Bongino is now weighing his resignation, highlighting an atmosphere of turmoil and recrimination within the department.</p>

          <p>In a satirical opinion piece, an Atlantic writer critiques the current state of NASA, highlighting budget cuts, layoffs of experienced staff, and the appointment of a former reality TV star as its interim head. The article humorously suggests that perhaps space exploration is no longer necessary, sarcastically framing the decline as a fitting part of an administration focused on undoing past achievements. The author argues that under the current leadership, NASA's mission seems to be less about reaching for the stars and more about managing a decline. The piece uses sharp satire to comment on the perceived de-prioritization of science and exploration.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned plea agreements for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two co-defendants that would have allowed them to avoid the death penalty. The ruling supports the authority of the Secretary of Defense, who had moved to revoke the deals after they were made, arguing that the victims' families and the public deserve to see a full trial. This decision reverses a lower military court's ruling and sends the high-profile case back toward a potential death penalty trial, further extending the legal proceedings that have been ongoing for years.</p>

Unlike other major AI models that refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok complied, reflecting Musk's push for a non-"woke" AI. The chatbot also appeared to source Musk's own political views when asked about controversial topics, raising concerns about its objectivity and potential for bias.</p>

          <p>HSBC has significantly upgraded its outlook on AMD, raising the stock to a "Buy" rating and doubling its price target to $200 per share. The analyst's optimism is driven by the belief that AMD's new MI350 data center GPUs will command a much higher average selling price than previously expected, potentially boosting 2026 AI-related sales to over $15 billion. The report also notes that AMD's Instinct accelerators are becoming more competitive with Nvidia's offerings, and the upcoming MI400 series could further challenge its rival's market dominance. This positive forecast reflects growing confidence in AMD's ability to capture a larger share of the lucrative AI hardware market. (not investment advice)</p>
