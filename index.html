          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to visit the White House amid tensions over the U.S. granting refugee status to Afrikaners, White South Africans of Dutch descent. The visit aims to "reset the strategic relationship" between the two countries, following criticism from the Trump administration regarding the treatment of Afrikaners, claiming they face racial discrimination. Ramaphosa has dismissed these claims, criticizing those leaving for the U.S. as "cowardly." The controversy stems from a new law allowing the state to seize land without compensation, leading some Afrikaners to seek refugee status, fearing they are being targeted.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, Walmart's former U.S. CEO, suggests the company can absorb tariff costs without raising prices, criticizing its "doom and gloom" commentary. He points to Walmart's increased gross profit margin and price deflation in general merchandise categories as evidence of its financial strength. Simon believes consumers can handle potential price increases due to a strong job market and lower fuel prices, but he warns that negative commentary from corporate executives could erode consumer confidence. Simon is now on the Darden Restaurants board and is the chairman at Hanesbrands.</p>

          <p>Doctors at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia successfully treated a 9Â½-month-old boy, KJ Muldoon, with a rare genetic disorder called CPS1 deficiency using a custom gene-editing treatment, making him the first patient of any age to receive such therapy. The treatment, presented at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, involves correcting a single mutation in KJ's DNA using CRISPR technology to enable his body to rid itself of ammonia. This breakthrough offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for thousands of other rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare by making these therapies more accessible and affordable. The experimental treatment was the result of decades of federally funded research.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler voiced his disagreement with the PGA of America's decision not to implement "lift, clean, place" for the first round of the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club, citing the impact of mud on the ball.

Despite the setback on the 16th hole, Scheffler finished the day 2-under par, while Ryan Gerard led the leaderboard. Scheffler acknowledged the position "a golf purist" would likely take.</p>

          <p>PG&E plans to reactivate a lithium battery plant near Monterey County, four months after a fire at an adjacent facility released toxic gases, sparking concerns from county officials. The Elkhorn Battery Energy Storage Facility, which did not burn, is set to restart by June to meet summer energy demands, despite objections from officials who want both facilities offline until the cause of the fire is determined. The Elkhorn facility was vacuum-cleaned and inspected following the fire. The Vistra owned facility burned after a fire, prompting the evacuation of 1,500 people.</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated Covid and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation. The Food and Drug Administration has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its Covid vaccine, and officials are questioning the use of the vaccine in children under 12. Experts express concern that these changes could undermine the use of all vaccines by raising doubts about their safety.</p>

          <h2>Political Divide Emerges Over 'Debanking' Practices</h2>

          <p>A political debate is brewing in Washington over "debanking," the practice of financial institutions closing accounts or denying services based on political positions. While conservatives argue that debanking constitutes politically motivated discrimination, banks maintain they are simply managing risk and running a profitable business. The Trump administration has expressed concerns, with President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent raising the issue. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also spoken out on behalf of individuals and businesses whose A.T.M. cards are shut off without warning. Despite the bipartisan attention, a clear solution remains elusive.</p>

          <p>A mega-bill encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda faces potential derailment as Republican hard-liners express opposition, citing concerns about the national debt. With a narrow margin in the House Budget Committee, the GOP can only afford to lose one vote to advance the bill. Key sticking points include Medicaid and tax reform, particularly the SALT cap, which has divided moderates and conservatives. House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to unify his conference and claims Republicans are aiming to pass the package in a "deficit-neutral way."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deals to sell advanced AI chips to the UAE and Saudi Arabia have created divisions within the government over whether they could lead to outsourcing the AI industry and benefiting China.

The deals involve the sale of advanced chips from Nvidia and AMD, with the UAE planning to build a large data center hub.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's request to roll back injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship, potentially limiting citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. The case addresses the legality of district court judges issuing nationwide injunctions, with the government arguing that such orders create an unfair legal playing field. Justices questioned the potential impact on the court system and the rights of individuals. Several justices expressed skepticism about the administration's arguments, citing potential violations of Supreme Court precedent.</p>
