          <p>The U.S. military conducted an airstrike in the Caribbean targeting an alleged drug vessel, marking the first time survivors have been reported from such an operation. This strike is at least the sixth of its kind under the Trump administration, which labels targeted vessels as operated by narcoterrorists, though public evidence for these assertions remains unreleased. The development of survivors contrasts with previous similar strikes where no survivors were claimed.

          <p>President Trump's unusual public admission of authorizing CIA covert operations in Venezuela grants the agency broad leeway for potential actions, including lethal strikes or efforts to destabilize the Maduro regime. This authorization, known as a presidential finding, does not require congressional approval, raising concerns about its scope and historical precedents of US interventions in Latin America. Former officials cited in the article warn of a 'slippery slope' given the CIA's mixed track record in the region. The article highlights that the specific nature and targets of these potential operations remain unclear, but could include sabotage or influence campaigns.</p>
