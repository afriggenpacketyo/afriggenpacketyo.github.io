          <p>A preliminary investigation into last month's Lisbon funicular crash, which tragically killed 16 people, has uncovered a series of critical failings. The report highlights that a defective underground cable, acting as a counterweight, was not certified for passenger transport and was technically unsuitable. Additionally, the emergency brake system failed to function properly and had never been tested, despite a third-party company having given the funicular an all-clear on the day of the disaster. Further tests are pending, but all Lisbon cable cars are now out of service for safety checks.</p>

          <p>Demolition work has commenced on a section of the White House East Wing to facilitate the construction of President Donald Trump's proposed $250 million ballroom. The project, described by Trump as "much-needed" and privately funded by "generous Patriots," has drawn significant criticism from lawmakers and on social media, with one former Congressman calling it an "utter desecration." The new 90,000 sq ft space is designed to accommodate large events and is expected to be completed before the end of Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv has announced it will not accept any ticket allocation from Aston Villa for their upcoming Europa League match, even if a ban on away supporters is lifted. This decision stems from paramount safety concerns, despite efforts by the UK government to fund necessary policing for fan attendance. Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group initially classified the fixture as "high risk" following previous violent clashes and hate crime incidents involving Maccabi Tel Aviv fans. The club maintains its fans are not to blame for the situation.</p>

          <p>Trump administration agencies are collaborating through the Interagency Weaponization Working Group (IWWG) to uncover what they describe as the Biden administration's "prolific and dangerous weaponization of government." Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard initiated the group, comprising officials from various intelligence and law enforcement bodies, to streamline information sharing and ensure accountability. Officials assert the IWWG aims to depoliticize government and restore equal justice, countering claims that it targets political opponents. They emphasize that the focus is on actions and individuals who illegally weaponized government powers.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old Rhode Island man who faked his death and fled to Scotland to avoid sexual assault charges, has been sentenced to five years in prison in Utah. This is the first of two sentences for convictions related to sexually assaulting two women in 2008, identified through a decade-old DNA sexual assault kit. Rossi was arrested in Scotland in 2021 after hospital staff recognized his tattoos from an Interpol notice, despite his claims of being an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight. He faces further sentencing in November for the second conviction.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the West's current framework for viewing China, which often projects a narrative of inevitable aggression, is a conceptual trap that could lead to conflict. Drawing parallels to historical cases where a rising power challenged a ruling one, the article suggests that applying Western historical conquest and rivalry onto China is like gazing into a mirror. Instead, it posits that China's 5,000-year history, deeply shaped by its land-bound geography and defensive cultural DNA, tells a different story. To avert war, the West must shatter this mirror and reconsider its perspective on China's rise.</p>

          <p>More than a third of new recruits at the ICE training academy are failing the personal-fitness test, impeding President Donald Trump's goal to double the agency's workforce. The test, requiring 15 push-ups, 32 sit-ups, and a 1.5-mile run in 14 minutes, has proven challenging, especially the run. Senior officials express concern over the quality of new hires, with standards already eased and fitness tests moved earlier in training to improve efficiency. Despite a $50,000 hiring bonus and other incentives, the high failure rate suggests a significant hurdle in meeting recruitment targets.</p>

          <p>As Americans consume less alcohol, cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC and sometimes CBD, are experiencing a surge in demand. These drinks, including seltzers, juices, and teas, are projected to grow from $1.1 billion to nearly $5.6 billion in sales by 2035. While many brands market them as nonalcoholic, zero-calorie alternatives, doctors caution about potential side effects like anxiety, paranoia, and impaired coordination. The patchwork of state regulations allows legal sales in 44 states, with major retailers like Target now testing the market. This trend is particularly appealing to women in their 30s and 40s seeking healthier alternatives to alcoholic drinks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Halloween Price Hikes Threaten to Make Holiday Scarier for Wallets</h2>

          <p>Halloween celebrations this year are projected to hit a record $13.1 billion in consumer spending, but price hikes, particularly for candy, may make the holiday more expensive. Cocoa prices have more than doubled due to extreme weather in West Africa, leading to a significant increase in chocolate bar costs. Additionally, a 15% tariff on imported spirits and a 30% tariff on Chinese-made costumes and decorations contribute to higher prices. Despite these costs, most Americans plan to celebrate, with many turning to budget-friendly options like DIY décor, generic candy, and early shopping to manage expenses.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth companies climbed as investors reacted to Chinese export restrictions and new U.S. strategies to secure a domestic supply chain. Prime Minister Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement to invest in joint ventures for critical minerals, aiming to reduce reliance on China. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also indicated plans for price floors in industries like rare earths to combat market manipulation. Companies like NioCorp, Energy Fuels, and USA Rare Earth saw significant gains, with William Blair initiating coverage on USA Rare Earth, anticipating a material stake from the Trump administration.

China's dominance in the global rare earths supply chain and recent export controls have spurred U.S. efforts to establish domestic sources, with the Defense Department already striking a deal with MP Materials.

Spears has vehemently denied substance abuse and accused Federline of profiting from their past, calling the book "extremely hurtful and exhausting."

The new film will showcase American landscapes and cityscapes, reflecting a potential shift towards an "America First" agenda, as seen in President Trump's policies.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced it will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, allowing officers to concentrate on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations. This policy change follows the dropping of a probe into Father Ted creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence in posts on X. The Crown Prosecution Service decided no further action was needed in Linehan's case, prompting the Met to clarify its stance on policing "toxic culture war debates." This move aims to provide clearer direction for officers and reduce ambiguity in handling perceived hostile acts that don't constitute a criminal offense.</p>
