          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team has formally requested his placement at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, to serve his four-year, two-month sentence. They emphasized the facility's residential drug treatment program as crucial for addressing his drug abuse issues and maximizing rehabilitative efforts, alongside available educational and occupational programs. Combs was convicted under the Mann Act for transporting individuals across state lines for sexual encounters, concluding a federal case that exposed disturbing aspects of his private life and influence in music. This request follows his sentencing, where he expressed a commitment to a drug-free, non-violent future, with his current detention time potentially reducing his sentence to three years. Judges often recommend placements, but the Bureau of Prisons makes the final decision based on various factors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second week as the Senate once again rejected competing funding proposals from both Democrats and Republicans. Neither measure garnered the necessary 60 votes, with both parties engaged in a blame game over the stalemate. President Trump urged Democrats to reopen the government, while Democrats maintained their demand for an extension of Affordable Care Act health subsidies. This ongoing impasse has resulted in critical food aid programs facing funding shortages and widespread federal worker furloughs. Essential services, including air traffic control at major airports like Hollywood Burbank, Las Vegas, and Denver, are experiencing severe staffing issues and delays, underscoring the immediate impact on public safety and daily life.</p>

          <p>Indirect talks aimed at a U.S. peace plan to end the Gaza war are continuing in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, focusing on conditions for a hostage-prisoner exchange. President Trump expressed strong optimism for a lasting deal, while Hamas has partially agreed to proposals but not to disarmament or relinquishing governance of Gaza. These discussions coincide with the two-year anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, which initiated the conflict. The 20-point plan, supported by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, proposes an immediate ceasefire and the release of 48 Israeli hostages for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, alongside full aid to Gaza and a potential path to a Palestinian state, despite Netanyahu's stated opposition to statehood.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump on Monday evening vehemently criticized Democratic lawmakers for the ongoing government shutdown, urging them to reopen the government immediately amidst what he described as a highly successful economy. Trump asserted that Democrats are responsible for the shutdown, which has impacted numerous essential programs and services. His remarks followed Senate Democrats again blocking Republican efforts to pass a funding bill, with Democrats insisting on extending expiring ObamaCare subsidies as a condition for their support. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reiterated that negotiations require the President's involvement, while Trump indicated a willingness to discuss healthcare, though Schumer denied any direct outreach.</p>

This expiration creates significant economic uncertainty for countries like Kenya, South Africa, Lesotho, and Madagascar, whose textile and apparel industries heavily rely on the U.S. market. The lack of renewal is expected to push African nations further into China's economic orbit, as they seek alternative trade partners and markets. Despite reported White House support for a one-year extension, no formal legislation was introduced to prevent the lapse, highlighting a critical shift in trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a record high for the second consecutive day, fueled by a tech sector rally on Wall Street following a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD. Chip stocks, including Advantest and Tokyo Electron, were among the top performers on the index. This surge also coincided with the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Meanwhile, Japanese Government Bond yields rose to all-time highs, with the 10-year JGB reaching its highest level since 2008, and the yen weakened against the dollar. The global tech momentum, particularly AMD's nearly 24% surge after its OpenAI deal, significantly contributed to these market gains.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker accused the Trump administration of a "military-style invasion" in Chicago, alleging the deployment of Black Hawk helicopters and over 100 tactical agents during an immigration raid. Pritzker claimed these actions were designed to sow fear and create a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act, which President Trump stated he would consider if courts or local leaders obstructed federal actions. The state and City of Chicago filed a lawsuit to block military deployment, arguing against the federalization of the National Guard without state consent. The Department of Homeland Security refuted Pritzker's claims, asserting the need to address violence and crime in Chicago.</p>

Supporters argue the road is vital for accessing over $7 billion worth of copper and other minerals crucial for national defense and economic competitiveness against China.

With approximately 70% of Hong Kong's merchandise trade and nearly half of its service trade already conducted with RCEP members, joining the bloc is expected to deepen existing economic ties and enhance its attractiveness as a market. The RCEP aims to eliminate 90% of tariffs over two decades, which would substantially lower trade barriers and reduce overhead costs for Hong Kong's small and medium-sized enterprises.

However, the trend is mixed, with developing countries like China leading clean energy expansion, while richer nations such as the U.S. and EU increased reliance on fossil fuels due to demand outpacing clean energy or weak renewable performance.

          <p>Multiple Massachusetts areas, including Boston, experienced large-scale vehicle takeovers and public disturbances over the weekend. In Boston's South End, over 100 people were involved in an incident where fireworks and objects were thrown at police cruisers. Two Rhode Island teens, Julian Bowers and William Cantwell, faced charges including assault and battery on a police officer. Similar, though less violent, incidents occurred in Dedham, Middleborough, and Randolph, with State Police reporting stolen plates and attempts to hit officers. Authorities are investigating potential connections between these events, which Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden condemned as "dangerous, intolerable assaults" on police and neighborhoods, vowing accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmacies in England are encountering significant issues with patients booking Covid-19 booster appointments only to discover they are no longer eligible due to tightened criteria. Eligibility now primarily includes those aged 75 and older, or younger patients with weakened immune systems. Community Pharmacy England reports that between a third and half of scheduled patients are being turned away, leading to widespread upset, frustration, and instances of abuse towards staff. Pharmacists attribute this confusion to insufficient public awareness regarding the changes, especially given last year's overlapping flu and Covid vaccine programs. NHS England has since updated its website to clarify the eligibility requirements.</p>

          <p>New research suggests a link between long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant from fossil fuel mining and combustion, and an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, prompted by a higher incidence of ALS in New Brunswick, Canada, compared 304 ALS patients to 1,207 healthy individuals, analyzing estimated pollution levels at their residences. Researchers found subjects had a 23% higher chance of an ALS diagnosis, though the study establishes association, not causation. This finding, even within Canada's clean air guidelines, highlights potential environmental factors in neurodegenerative diseases and calls for improved regulatory intervention and a shift away from combustion-based energy.</p>

          <p>Modeling scams are resurfacing, now increasingly targeting older individuals, as highlighted by the experience of 79-year-old Judy Corker. These schemes, which have historically exploited young people, lure victims with promises of modeling careers and then charge hundreds for fake portfolios and non-existent jobs. Scammers often pressure victims to pay via PayPal's "friends and family" option, which lacks buyer protection. Judy Corker lost money to such a scam after being promised a cruise company job, while Roland Parker lost around £1,000. Authorities and genuine studios are warning the public about this "scam on a big scale," urging caution and the use of protected payment methods for any goods or services.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its efforts to deploy National Guard troops to cities like Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, despite strong opposition from state and local leaders. Up to 400 Texas National Guard troops are reportedly en route to Chicago, despite an Illinois judge declining an immediate block. Earlier, a federal judge in Oregon rejected two attempts by President Trump to send National Guard troops to Portland, a city he falsely described as "war ravaged." The administration justifies these deployments by citing protests at ICE facilities, which local leaders argue are exaggerated to create a pretext for federal intervention and military training in Democratic-led cities.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed bullish sentiment on Take-Two Interactive, citing its newfound "scarcity value" in the video game industry following major competitors going private. With Activision acquired by Microsoft and Electronic Arts recently taken private, Take-Two stands as the sole major publicly-traded American pure-play video game company. Cramer highlighted the company's strong performance, including beating Wall Street estimates and raising its full-year forecast, driven by successful franchises like Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K. He anticipates significant success for the upcoming "Grand Theft Auto VI," suggesting any stock dip due to delays could be a buying opportunity for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has instructed its members to continue working during the U.S. government shutdown, warning that job actions could lead to termination. This directive comes as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reported a slight increase in sick calls among air traffic controllers since the shutdown began, impacting air travel safety and efficiency. Controllers, deemed essential workers, are required to work without pay and face missing their first paycheck, creating significant financial hardship and morale issues. NATCA emphasized the importance of maintaining professionalism to protect public safety and the union's credibility, despite the "uncertainty and hardships" faced by its members.</p>

These changes, the first rate increase in over a decade, aim to encourage vehicle turnover, support businesses by freeing up spaces, and generate revenue for the financially struggling city.

Immergut's ruling emphasized that the President's determination for military intervention must be "tethered to the facts," not exaggerated claims of unrest.

The new plan is expected to outline development goals for the coming half-decade, with entrepreneurs hoping for a lifeline, particularly in securing financing compared to state-owned competitors.
