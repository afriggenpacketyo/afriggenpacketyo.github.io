          <p>The BBC accompanied injured children from Gaza as they were evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment after 19 months of war. The evacuees, including children with severe injuries and illnesses, traveled by ambulance and helicopter to Amman, where they will receive specialized care. One mother expressed relief at leaving Gaza, describing the situation there as "horrible" and impossible to describe due to hunger, death, and constant bombing. Jordan aims to bring 2,000 sick children from Gaza for treatment, but the process has been impeded by delays and restrictions.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its disbandment after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a move welcomed by Turkish government and opposition politicians alike. This decision could significantly alter the political landscape in Turkey, particularly for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM). The dissolution raises questions about the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to emerge. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan emphasized that merely laying down arms is insufficient, requiring the elimination of illegal structures and the development of an accountable organizational model.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei issued a decree to curb immigration, drawing parallels to the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration. The executive order tightens citizenship requirements, mandating immigrants spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment to secure a passport. It also requires immigrants seeking permanent residency to demonstrate proof of income and a clean criminal record. The decree also facilitates the deportation of migrants who enter the country illegally or commit minor crimes, and charges foreigners for access to public healthcare and education.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is booming due to pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications like Wegovy and Ozempic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate but notes that potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, contracting manufacturers in other countries to produce and ship products. The IMF projects medium-term growth at around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

Japan faces a rice shortage due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption at restaurants driven by a surge in foreign tourists.

The ISC expects a reduction in pupils applying for private schools due to the increased costs.

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a tax bill to cut billions in climate-related funding, reduce regulations, and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump's tax cuts. The legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, impacting renewable energy, manufacturing, and electric vehicles. Concurrently, the proposal streamlines permitting for fossil fuels and rescinds Clean Air Act pollution funding. Some Republican senators have cautioned against a full-scale repeal of tax credits, citing potential disruptions to businesses and higher energy costs.</p>

Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a new round of ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul, but European leaders rebuffed the offer without an unconditional ceasefire. The conflict has seen several short-term agreements repeatedly breached, with both sides accusing each other of violations.
