          <p>Observers suggest that the failure of President Marcos to undermine the Duterte political dynasty could lead to improved relations between China and the Philippines, especially if Vice-President Duterte succeeds in the 2028 presidential election. Duterte, facing impeachment trials, needs Senate support to avoid conviction and maintain her eligibility for the race. Preliminary results indicate that Marcos' allies secured fewer Senate seats than expected, potentially shielding Duterte from conviction. This article highlights the ongoing political dynamics in the Philippines and their potential impact on foreign relations with China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri's near-complete abortion ban could potentially return if a new ballot measure advanced by the Republican-controlled legislature gains voter approval. This amendment seeks to repeal the earlier Amendment 3, which enshrined abortion protections in the state's constitution, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Democrats attempted to filibuster the move, but Republicans bypassed it using procedural rules, and Governor Kehoe could call a special election on the issue. If passed, the new measure would include exceptions for sexual assault and incest.</p>

          <p>Smartmatic has accused Fox News and Fox Corp executives, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, of orchestrating the destruction of text messages related to the 2020 election claims, creating an "evidentiary void." The voting machine company alleges that this action was intentional and aimed at concealing evidence of what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts. Fox News denies the allegations, calling them a "desperate attempt to distract" from a recent ruling granting Fox access to documents related to a Department of Justice investigation into Smartmatic executives.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. This decision, driven by higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty, will not affect those already enrolled, but new applications will be frozen. Additionally, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will have to pay a monthly premium starting in 2027, aiming to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>
