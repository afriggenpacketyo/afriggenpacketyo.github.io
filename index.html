          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher as investors react to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points. The move, which places the rate between 4.00% and 4.25%, was described by Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a "risk management" measure, tempering expectations for a long series of cuts. Global markets showed mixed reactions, with Japan's Nikkei reaching a new record, while traders in Europe also await the Bank of England's upcoming interest rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

While campus police stated there is no evidence of foul play and no ongoing threat, the student's family has hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump to conduct an independent investigation. The family and community are pressing for transparency, particularly regarding any available video footage, as officials call for patience amid high emotions and historical sensitivities.</p>

          <p>Edward Enninful, the former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, has expressed concern that the fashion industry is at risk of reverting to older, less inclusive beauty standards. He noted that a cultural "anti-woke" movement is contributing to a resurgence where being super-thin and European is again seen as the norm. Enninful, who recently launched a new inclusive media platform, emphasized that true beauty is not confined to one type and that the industry must decide what values it stands for in this period of flux.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered his best performance of the season, pitching seven scoreless innings and striking out a season-high 12 batters in a 5-0 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies. Manager Dave Roberts showed confidence in Snell by leaving him in the game during a tense seventh inning, a decision that paid off as Snell struck out the final batter. The strong start provided much-needed relief for the team's struggling bullpen, with Shohei Ohtani also contributing by hitting his 51st home run of the season.</p>

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship is set to arrive at the International Space Station after its initial rendezvous was delayed by two premature engine shutdowns. NASA confirmed the issue was resolved, explaining that a conservative software safeguard caused the shutdowns, and the spacecraft is now operating as intended. Astronauts Jonny Kim and Zena Cardman will use the station's robotic arm to capture the vessel, which is carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, spare parts, and research materials for the crew.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Plan to Designate Antifa as a Terrorist Organization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 22:14:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to designate the decentralized, far-left activist movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The move raises legal and practical questions, as the U.S. does not have a domestic terrorism statute equivalent to the one for foreign groups, largely due to First Amendment protections. The announcement came shortly after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's show over comments related to the killing of Charlie Kirk, with Trump praising the network's decision amid a broader clash over political speech.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has announced a partnership with over 40 conservative organizations, including the America First Policy Institute and Turning Point USA, to develop "patriotic" civics programming. The initiative, named the America 250 Civics Education Coalition, aims to renew patriotism and promote understanding of America's founding principles ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. This move comes as the Trump administration works to reduce the department's federal oversight and return more control over education to the states.</p>

          <p>This article explores how music serves as a crucial element in setting the tone and conveying the narrative of collections at New York Fashion Week. Designers used carefully curated soundtracks to evoke specific emotions, from nostalgia and arousal to disorientation, transforming runway presentations into immersive experiences. Examples include Campillo's use of a whispered poem as a mantra, Eckhaus Latta's Nuyorican-inspired beats, and Collina Strada's chaotic collage reflecting the concept of the shadow self, demonstrating that sound is as vital as the clothing itself.</p>
