            <p>A Russian ballistic missile strike on the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of at least 31 people, including two children, and injuries to 84 others. The attack, which occurred on Palm Sunday, targeted residential buildings in the city center. Ukrainian officials condemned the strike as a deliberate act of terror against civilians, with President Zelenskyy calling for a strong international response and increased pressure on Russia to end the war.

            <p>The article argues that a dangerous new ideology, "end times fascism," is gaining traction among the far-right, blending corporate libertarianism with apocalyptic survivalism. This ideology envisions a future of fortressed nations and high-tech enclaves for the elite, while advocating for the expulsion of unwanted populations and the exploitation of resources. The author connects this trend to Christian fundamentalist interpretations of the Rapture and criticizes the lack of a hopeful vision for the future, urging resistance against this "monstrous, supremacist survivalism" and a commitment to collective survival and planetary stewardship.</p>

            <p>An outgoing US vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, has criticized Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for offering "false hope" to families regarding the cause of autism. Marks disputes Kennedy's claim that the Trump administration will identify the cause of autism by September, emphasizing the complexity of the condition and refuting any link to vaccines. Marks resigned from the FDA, citing Kennedy's misinformation regarding vaccines. The criticism comes amidst a measles outbreak in under-vaccinated communities and concerns over Kennedy's skepticism toward established vaccines.</p>

            <p>Autoworkers and small business owners in Flint, Michigan, are expressing mixed reactions to President Trump's proposed tariffs, fearing potential economic consequences. While some supporters believe tariffs could revitalize the local economy, others worry about rising prices on everyday goods and the impact on middle-class families. Small business owners, particularly those relying on imports, are concerned about the potential for significant financial strain. The debate highlights the tension between the promise of industrial revival and the risk of economic hardship for working-class communities. </p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering pathways to deport American citizens, raising concerns about due process and the rule of law. This potential move follows a pattern of increasingly aggressive immigration policies, including the deportation of immigrants with limited or no due process, targeting individuals for their protected speech, and deporting them to foreign prisons. Critics argue that these actions undermine fundamental rights and create a dangerous precedent for the treatment of all citizens. The Supreme Court's inaction on lower court orders has further enabled the administration's agenda.</p>

            <p>President Trump abruptly reversed course on his sweeping tariff policies, announcing a 90-day pause for most countries after initially vowing no retreat. The decision followed mounting economic and political pressure, including market instability and criticism from Republicans and business leaders. While the White House attempted to portray the move as a strategic masterstroke, the reversal damaged America's standing as a reliable ally and raised concerns about Trump's economic leadership.

            <p>The US has quietly exempted smartphones, including iPhones, from the 125% tariff on goods from China, a significant retreat from the Trump administration's trade war rhetoric. This decision avoids a potential price surge for iPhones in the US and suggests a possible softening of the administration's stance on Chinese imports. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who maintains strong relationships with both President Trump and President Xi, may play a key role in mediating future trade negotiations. The exemption highlights the complex interplay between trade policy, economic interests, and global supply chains.</p>

While some experts believe Americans' love for cheap goods will persist, others see an opportunity for more sustainable and domestic options to gain traction.

            <p>California farmers are bracing for the potential consequences of President Trump's tariff policies, which have already begun to disrupt international trade and create economic uncertainty. While Trump paused the larger tariffs for 90 days, the existing tariffs on goods from Canada and China, key markets for California's agricultural products, are causing concern. Farmers fear retaliatory tariffs from other countries could lead to significant losses and long-lasting damage to the industry. Many farmers are hoping for swift resolution to avoid a deeper crisis. </p>

            <p>The article posits that the Trump administration is waging a war on the professional managerial class (PMC), aiming to dismantle their institutional power and authority. This campaign involves mass firings, undermining institutions like universities and law firms, and stigmatizing expertise. Drawing parallels to Maoism, the author argues that Trump's actions represent a cultural revolution against the intelligentsia, with potentially detrimental consequences for the economy and society. The piece explores the historical roots of this animosity toward the PMC and its implications for the future of American politics.</p>

            <p>The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has declined to guarantee that British Steel's blast furnaces in Scunthorpe will remain operational following the government's takeover of the Chinese-owned plant. Despite emergency legislation passed to prevent the furnaces' closure, Reynolds would not confirm whether sufficient raw material supplies could be secured in time. He emphasized that the takeover was essential for maintaining steel production in the UK, but the situation remains "difficult and challenging." The uncertainty raises concerns about the long-term viability of steel production in the region.</p>

            <p>General Motors is temporarily halting production of BrightDrop electric delivery vans at its CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario, leading to temporary layoffs for hundreds of workers. The decision comes as GM faces challenges with excess inventory and struggles to compete in the electric van market.

            <p>A retrial of Sarah Palin's defamation case against *The New York Times* is set to begin, stemming from a 2017 editorial that falsely linked her to a mass shooting. The initial trial resulted in a loss for Palin, but a judge's error opened the door for a retrial. The case has implications for press freedoms and the legal standards for defamation claims by public figures. This legal battle is not seeking financial compensation for Palin, but rather aims to challenge the current protections afforded to the press.</p>

            <p>Comedian Stewart Lee uses Sam Peckinpah's film "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" as a metaphor for the Trump era, where American freedoms are under attack by big business and those in power must choose between doing the right thing or bending the knee to tyranny. He sees parallels between the film's themes and the current political landscape, where everything is nakedly transactional. The essay also touches on the challenges of creating political satire in a world where reality often surpasses the absurdities of comedy. The article provides a satirical commentary.</p>

            <p>Legal experts are debating the potential impact of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act on married women's voting rights, particularly those who have changed their last names. The Act's requirement to prove U.S. citizenship before registering to vote could disproportionately affect married women whose birth certificates no longer match their current names. While supporters claim the Act allows states to determine additional acceptable documents, critics worry about inconsistent enforcement and potential disenfranchisement. Obtaining marriage certificates may pose challenges for some, potentially creating barriers to voting.</p>
