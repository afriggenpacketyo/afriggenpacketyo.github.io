          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that withholding state tax payments to the federal government would constitute "criminal tax evasion." The warning came after Newsom threatened to cut tax payments in response to potential federal funding cuts targeting California. Bessent described Newsom's comments as "extremely reckless" and advised him to focus on tax-cutting plans. The exchange highlights escalating tensions between the California government and the Trump administration over federal funding and state policies.</p>

Unlike Jude, who plays as a number 10, Jobe can play as a defensive or box-to-box midfielder, showcasing versatility. After a season with Sunderland, where he played 43 times, scoring four goals, Jobe's move to Germany is seen as a positive step in his career. The Bundesliga offers a stepping stone between the Championship and the Premier League, providing a less pressured environment for his development.</p>

          <p>The Major League Soccer Playersâ€™ Association (MLSPA) has criticized MLS's proposal for Club World Cup bonuses, deeming the 20% payout "below the international standard." MLS proposed that players receive 20% of a teamâ€™s performance-based prize money at each stage of the tournament, with no cap on maximum payout. The MLSPA said the league attempted to "strong-arm" players into CBA waivers unrelated to the Club World Cup. The dispute arose after the Seattle Sounders protested the original prize money structure, highlighting tensions between players and the league over financial compensation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles to confront immigration protests is criticized as an assault on democracy and an attempt to provoke public violence. By militarizing the situation, Trump aims to divert attention from his failures and reestablish his image as a strongman. The move is seen as an effort to radicalize citizen-soldiers and create a national emergency to justify authoritarian control. Critics urge restraint and caution against confronting the military, emphasizing the importance of legal and political resistance to thwart Trump's agenda.</p>
