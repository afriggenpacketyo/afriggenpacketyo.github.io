        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea, once an economic marvel, is on the brink of a demographic crisis, with its birth rate currently at 0.748, far below the 2.1 replacement level. Studies from the Bank of Korea and Korea Development Institute project a prolonged economic downturn, potentially contracting by the 2040s, as a shrinking workforce impacts productivity and the pension system. Despite significant government spending on incentives, efforts to boost childbirth have largely failed, raising concerns about defense implications due to a smaller draft pool. However, some analysts remain optimistic, suggesting the economy can adapt through technological innovation and immigration policies, highlighting humanity's historical adaptability to overcome challenges.</p>

          <p>Startup founders share their experiences bouncing back from business failures, highlighting the immense pressure and emotional toll involved. Serial entrepreneur Ismael Dainehine and others discuss the challenges of admitting failure, disappointing investors, and laying off employees, which can lead to an identity crisis for those deeply invested in their ventures. A Rutgers Business School study even found an "entrepreneurship penalty," where recruiters are less likely to hire former business owners. However, many find that the diverse skills gained from running a business, like multitasking and time management, make founders excellent employees. Redefining success and focusing on a deep sense of purpose are crucial for resilience and moving forward after setbacks.</p>

          <p>China is actively relaxing its visa-free entry rules to significantly boost its tourism sector and attract more foreign visitors. Passport holders from 55 nations, including Australia, Russia, Indonesia, the United States, and several European countries, can now enjoy stays of up to 10 days when transiting through international airports. Furthermore, an expanding list of foreign nationals is permitted to remain for up to 30 days without needing a visa. This initiative, exemplified by the recent announcement allowing Russian citizens a 30-day visa-free stay, aims to streamline entry processes and signals a deliberate effort to enhance international engagement and economic activity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced the revocation of Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa, citing his "reckless and incendiary actions" during a pro-Palestinian protest in New York. Petro, while in New York for the UN General Assembly, urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders from President Trump and incite violence. This incident follows Petro's earlier strong criticisms of the Trump administration, including a call for a criminal inquiry into U.S. strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, which he claimed killed unarmed young people. The move further strains the historical alliance between the two countries, which has deteriorated under Colombia's first leftist leader.</p>

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party maintains dominance over traditional media and heavily invests in online political advertising, fostering a cult of personality and targeting opponents. Critics, including the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, accuse Wagenknecht's movement of fueling hatred, while others hope the debate on compulsory military service could mobilize more people for peace.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is poised to reimpose extensive economic and military sanctions on Iran, a decade after they were lifted under the landmark nuclear deal. This decision follows accusations from the UK, France, and Germany that Iran failed to uphold its commitments, triggering a 30-day diplomatic window that has now closed. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the move as "unfair, unjust, and illegal," despite his country having stepped up banned nuclear activities since the US withdrew from the deal in 2016. The sanctions, which include an arms embargo and bans on uranium enrichment, add significant strain to an already tense international situation, with Iran seeking reassurances against attacks on its nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada is more than a championship match; it's a critical moment for the future of women's Test rugby. England, the top-ranked team, benefits from substantial funding, including 32 full-time professional contracts and the world's best domestic league, leading to a dominant win record. In stark contrast, Canada, ranked second, operates on a fraction of England's budget, with players earning significantly less and relying on crowdfunding for World Cup preparation. This disparity raises questions about whether Canada's success could encourage other cash-strapped unions to pursue more nimble, targeted preparation, potentially undermining the argument for full-time professionalism across the sport.</p>

          <p>NPR has filed a lawsuit against the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), seeking to block a $57.9 million grant to a new consortium for operating the public radio satellite system. This legal action reveals escalating tensions within public media following Congressional Republicans' decision, at President Trump's insistence, to strip all federal funding for public broadcasting for the next two years. NPR alleges that CPB reversed an earlier agreement to extend NPR's contract, bowing to the Trump administration's pressure and its accusations of bias against NPR. The lawsuit highlights NPR's concern for the integrity and stability of the public radio system, arguing that CPB's actions contravene First Amendment protections and the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.</p>

          <p>Michele Beckwith, the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, claims she was fired after informing the Border Patrol chief that agents could not conduct indiscriminate immigration raids in California's Central Valley due to a court injunction. Beckwith, a career prosecutor, emphasized the necessity of complying with court orders and the Constitution, particularly after a federal judge ruled that earlier Border Patrol tactics likely violated protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Her termination, just before Border Patrol proceeded with a raid in Sacramento, highlights the Trump administration's aggressive push for its immigration policies and the pressure on Justice Department officials who challenge them.</p>

          <p>A California man faces a murder charge after allegedly conducting a targeted, vigilante-style killing of a registered child sexual offender in the San Francisco Bay Area. Varun Suresh, 29, researched registered sexual offenders using Megan’s Law and deliberately targeted 71-year-old David Brimmer, posing as a CPA to lure him out. Suresh reportedly told police the killing was "honestly really fun" and that he "didn’t feel sad at all," having waited years to commit such an act due to the pain sexual offenders cause children. This tragic event underscores the severe consequences of vigilantism and the complex issues surrounding public access to offender registries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue its freeze of over $4 billion in foreign aid, which was previously approved by Congress. The 6-3 conservative majority ruled that the "asserted harms" to Trump's foreign affairs conduct "appear to outweigh the potential harm" to aid recipients, though it's not a final determination. Liberal justices dissented, with Kagan arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over spending. The Trump administration, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has drastically downsized foreign aid, even merging USAID programs, prompting warnings from humanitarian groups about dire global health consequences.

          <p>A federal judge in Minnesota has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent ally of President Trump, defamed election technology company Smartmatic with false statements about the 2020 presidential election. The judge found 51 instances where Lindell falsely claimed Smartmatic's machines rigged the election, but deferred on whether he acted with "actual malice," which Smartmatic needs to prove for damages. Lindell maintains an "unwavering belief" in his claims, despite previous legal setbacks, including a $2.3 million defamation award to a Dominion Voting Systems employee. Smartmatic seeks "nine-figure damages" and continues its legal actions against other outlets that spread similar misinformation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he expects more of his political enemies to face criminal charges, a day after the Justice Department indicted former FBI Director James Comey. Trump's remarks underscore concerns about his administration's use of the justice system for retribution, particularly given the perceived weakness of the Comey case. The indictment, filed by a newly appointed US attorney with no prosecutorial experience, accused Comey of misleading lawmakers, a charge that had previously been deemed insufficient for prosecution by other officials. This development intensifies fears that political appointees will pursue cases against Trump's critics, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Senator Adam Schiff.</p>

The judge noted that one document implied a failure to concur on all three counts, while Comey was ultimately indicted on two. This procedural irregularity, combined with the late hour of the session and the fact that a majority of grand jurors barely met the threshold for indictment, raises further questions about the politicization of the Justice Department under the current administration.</p>
