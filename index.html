          <p>Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its nearly three-decade run as a public company. The acquisition price represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current valuation, a move occurring during a challenging period for the retail industry due to trade wars and discretionary spending concerns. Skechers' CEO, Robert Greenberg, will remain in his role, and 3G Capital believes in the long-term growth potential of Skechers, the world's third-largest footwear company.

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to continued disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which has seen hundreds of flights delayed or canceled. Schumer attributes the issues to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, DOGE cuts at the FAA, and outdated technology. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area." U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to release a plan to revamp the air traffic control system this week.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over repealing Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are vital for some constituents, particularly in rural Alaska where energy costs are exorbitant due to reliance on flown-in diesel. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 offered a chance for villages like Noatak to expand local solar energy sources, but Trump's move to defund the law and hard-right Republican demands for repeal have jeopardized these projects. Senator Lisa Murkowski is a vocal proponent of keeping the tax credits, arguing their termination would create uncertainty and harm job creation in the energy sector, especially impacting isolated communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to reopen Alcatraz as a substantially enlarged maximum-security prison for America's most violent offenders. The move aims to symbolize law, order, and justice, but faces significant hurdles, including high construction and operating costs. Alcatraz was closed in 1963 due to being too expensive to operate, as everything needed to be brought to the island by boat. Currently, Alcatraz is a museum administered by the National Park Service.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans, ending a nearly five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent analysis shows that delinquency rates among student loan borrowers are at an all-time high, with roughly 20% at risk of defaulting. Those in default could face wage garnishment, portions of Social Security benefits being withheld, and a tanked credit score. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies.</p>

The study indicates a growing preference among European consumers to avoid U.S. products and brands altogether, regardless of cost, driven by anguish over Trump's treatment of America's allies and trade policies. This shift is evident in grass-roots boycotts, app development to identify American products, and declining sales of U.S. brands like Tesla and McDonald's.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute is hosting the "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style" exhibition and gala, spotlighting Black male style during a time of increased scrutiny of race and diversity. With the federal government targeting diversity initiatives, the Met's show, devoted to designers of color and the use of fashion as a tool of self-actualization, has taken on new relevance. The event, co-chaired by ASAP Rocky, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, and Pharrell Williams, aims to center Black fashion in an institution that has historically excluded it.</p>

          <p>The Australian election results suggest that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation no longer holds the power to sway voters, having consistently supported the Coalition without discernible impact since 2010. The decline of News Corporation's influence is part of a wider trend of waning influence for mainstream media, with audiences increasingly accessing news from diverse sources. The article suggests that the key to media success is reporting with objectivity and integrity, rather than relying on opinionated content.</p>

These events are poised to generate millions for Trump and reflect a policy shift in Washington towards crypto, credited to Trump-aligned appointees.</p>

These talks are part of a broader effort to convince nations to receive deportees, including migrants whose home countries won't take them back.
