          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, marking the largest upward adjustment since January. This significant move follows a dovish pivot by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole conference, where he signaled a potential interest rate cut in September, departing from his earlier more hawkish stance. Consequently, the offshore yuan climbed to its strongest level since late July, reflecting strong market expectations for Fed easing. Economists are now closely watching the scale and pace of these anticipated rate cuts throughout the year, which are expected to have a continued impact on global financial markets and currency valuations.

The 38-year-old Serb, aiming for a record 25th major title, acknowledged his lack of match practice but praised his ability to win crucial points. Meanwhile, American hopes Ben Shelton and Taylor Fritz also advanced to the second round, with Fritz being the last American man to reach a major final at Flushing Meadows. Their strong start highlights a promising period for American men's tennis, with two players seeded in the top eight for the first time since 2007.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has developed over the Atlantic Ocean, slowly gaining strength and projected to move north-northeast for the next couple of days. Located approximately 320 miles east of Bermuda, the storm has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate Fernand will strengthen through Monday before gradually weakening late Monday or Tuesday, remaining over open waters. NOAA had predicted an above-normal hurricane season this year, with Fernand following Hurricane Erin, which previously reached Category 5 intensity without making landfall.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's re-election, a growing number of Americans are relocating to Europe, citing a desire to escape increasing polarization and policies targeting immigrants, diversity, and political opponents. Relocation firms in European cities like London, Lisbon, and Madrid report a surge in inquiries, with US applications for Irish passports reaching a decade-high. Celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres have also publicly shared their moves abroad, further galvanizing the trend. European institutions, such as France's Aix-Marseille University, are capitalizing on this exodus by offering programs like 'scientific asylum' to attract US talent, reflecting a broader sentiment of unease among some American citizens.</p>

          <p>China is preparing for the test flight of a 1MW floating wind power generation system, which resembles an airship and is touted as a solution for remote and disaster-stricken areas.

An earlier, smaller-scale iteration successfully ascended to 1,000 meters in January, demonstrating the feasibility of transmitting electricity to the ground. This development signifies a potential leap in turbine technology, offering a flexible and deployable energy source for challenging environments.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) announced that director Ryan Coogler and artist Mary Corse will be honored at its 14th annual Art+Film Gala on November 1. This event, co-chaired by Eva Chow and Leonardo DiCaprio, will be the last before the museum's new Peter Zumthor-designed building opens next spring. Coogler, known for films like 'Black Panther' and the recent hit 'Sinners,' is celebrated for his masterful storytelling. Corse, a Topanga-based painter, is recognized for her experimental approach to art, particularly her 'White Light' series, which explores perception through innovative material use. The gala aims to strengthen the ties between film and visual art, raising millions for LACMA's programming and acquisitions.</p>

          <p>The airline industry is on the cusp of a major transformation in its booking systems, moving towards modern digital retail models akin to Amazon and Spotify. Travel tech companies like Flyr are developing next-generation 'offer and order management' systems to replace outdated passenger service systems (PSS). These new systems will enable features like shopping carts, allowing for simultaneous booking of different flights, varied seat classes, and additional services within a single transaction. Riyadh Air, launching later this year, will be the first 'digitally native' airline to operate without legacy PSS technology, setting a precedent for personalized and flexible booking experiences aimed at increasing airline revenue and competitiveness against online travel agents.</p>

Chávez, who has struggled with addiction and faced prior arrests, was initially detained in the U.S. for visa overstay and then deported, leading to his transfer to Mexican authorities who have been investigating him since 2019.</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market after more than 15 years, marking a grim milestone in its spectacular fall from grace. Once China's largest real estate firm with a $50bn valuation, Evergrande collapsed under $300bn of debt, becoming a symbol of the country's ongoing property crisis. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined and banned from China's capital market for overstating revenue. The liquidation order, issued in January 2024, came after the company failed to offer a viable plan to shed its overseas liabilities, wiping over 99% from its stock market valuation. Experts believe the property slump remains a major drag on China's economy, with no clear end in sight.</p>

The French ministry firmly refuted these claims, emphasizing its full mobilization against such acts and citing the Vienna Convention's prohibition against interfering in internal affairs.

Prior to acting, he was a stage manager, supervisor, and director for more than 50 Broadway productions, working with stars like Julie Andrews and Richard Burton. Adler, who published a memoir last year, embraced acting later in life, famously stating, 'I think retirement is a road to nowhere,' and continued to work consistently.</p>

Separately, Fox News, facing a defamation suit from Smartmatic, claims LA County Registrar-Recorder Dean Logan may have received unreported gifts from the company, including travel and meals. Smartmatic denies wrongdoing by the company, asserting ethical operations, while Logan maintains contract compliance and denies gift reporting requirements for personal interactions.

Trump doubled down on his claims of an 'out of control, crime ridden' Baltimore, despite local police data showing significant reductions in gun violence.

          <p>Russian state-backed media outlets, RT and Sputnik, are significantly expanding their international presence, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, coinciding with bans in Western countries. This strategic expansion leverages anti-Western sentiments and fills voids left by downsizing Western media. RT, for instance, has launched new services in Serbian and Amharic, while offering training to journalists from the Global South. Critics argue this expansion involves careful manipulation of narratives, such as portraying Russia's actions as self-defense and denying war crimes, though audiences often perceive RT as a legitimate broadcaster.

          <p>Victims of violent cartels in Ecuador are seeking asylum in the US, but face increasing challenges under President Trump's stricter immigration policies. Gabriela, whose family experienced kidnapping and murder, exemplifies those fleeing escalating cartel violence. US asylum law, which recognizes five grounds for protection, does not neatly fit cartel-related persecution, making cases difficult to prove. Trump's administration previously made it harder to claim asylum from gang violence, and his recent executive orders expanding deportations and designating cartels as terrorist organizations create an environment where victims fear being accused of 'material support' to the very groups they are escaping. A significant backlog of asylum cases further complicates their quest for safety.</p>
