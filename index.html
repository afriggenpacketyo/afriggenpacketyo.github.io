          <p>A man in Bradford, UK, has received a life sentence with a minimum of 28 years for the murder of his estranged wife, Kulsuma Akter. He stabbed her 26 times in broad daylight as she was pushing their infant son in a pram. The judge described the attack as "vicious and merciless," noting the deliberate and fatal nature of the wounds. Masum, originally from Bangladesh, faces a high likelihood of deportation after serving his minimum term.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street predictions, largely driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment. However, the company saw a 1% decline in global unit case volume, indicating weakening consumer demand in markets like North America and Asia Pacific. Despite the mixed volume results, Coke narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast to the upper end of its previous range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is expanding immigrant detention capacity by utilizing military bases in New Jersey and Indiana, a move enabled by a national emergency declaration.

In separate news, Israeli ground forces have entered central Gaza for the first time in the 21-month conflict, ordering evacuations in an area that houses many international aid organizations. This military operation aims to pressure Hamas into a ceasefire deal but intensifies the humanitarian crisis for displaced Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A council leader in Epping, England, has warned of a "powder keg" situation following large protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers. The demonstrations, which attracted over 1,000 people and involved far-right activist Tommy Robinson, were sparked by the arrest of an asylum seeker for alleged sexual assaults. The council leader has urged the Home Office to close the hotel as a housing location, citing its unsuitability and the need to maintain peace in the community. Six arrests have been made in connection with the recent protests.</p>

          <p>The Harvard Education Publishing Group has abruptly canceled an entire special issue of the Harvard Educational Review focused on Palestine, just before its scheduled publication. The move has shocked contributors and editors, who accuse the publisher of censorship and caving to political pressure amid a climate of repression surrounding pro-Palestinian scholarship. The publisher cited a lack of "internal alignment" and process issues, but authors and editors contend the decision was an unprecedented act of institutional censorship, highlighting the "Palestine exception" to academic freedom. The cancellation occurred after the publisher demanded an unusual, late-stage legal review of the articles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has proposed to rewrite or repeal over 60 workplace regulations, aiming to reduce what it calls burdensome rules from previous administrations. The changes would impact millions, potentially lowering wages for home health care workers, rescinding safety protections for migrant farmworkers, and weakening safety standards for construction sites and mines. While the department claims the move will spur economic growth, critics and labor advocates argue the proposals would significantly increase risks for workers, particularly women and minorities, and could lead to more on-the-job injuries and fatalities.</p>

The author contends that unlike past federal interventions that protected civil rights against state opposition, the current administration is using federal power to undermine state laws and individual rights.

          <p>The death toll from a military training jet crash into a Dhaka school has risen to 31, including 25 students, prompting widespread grief and anger in Bangladesh. Hundreds of students have protested, demanding accountability and an end to training flights over populated areas. The Chinese-made F-7BGI aircraft reportedly experienced a technical malfunction during the pilot's first solo flight. The crash, which left the school in flames and injured dozens more, is one of the deadliest in the capital's recent history and has led to a national day of mourning.</p>

          <p>According to tech pundits, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has become a more influential political figure in Washington than counterparts like Apple's Tim Cook or Tesla's Elon Musk. His influence is attributed to the critical role of Nvidia's AI chips in the global technology landscape and his successful lobbying efforts. A key example cited is the recent reversal of a U.S. restriction on exporting certain AI chips to China, a move that followed meetings between Huang and President Trump. This demonstrates his growing ability to navigate and shape policy in the high-stakes tech trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from the Center for Working-Class Politics argues that a specific segment of Donald Trump's voters can be won over by Democrats. The research indicates that while working-class voters are often more socially moderate than the Democratic base, they are also broadly supportive of an "economic egalitarian" agenda. The study identifies that about 11% of Trump's working-class supporters hold these socially moderate and economically progressive views. The author suggests that a "social populist" platform, combining worker-focused economic policies with more moderate cultural messaging, could be key to rebuilding a Democratic majority.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace could face sharp premium increases in 2026 if Congress does not extend pandemic-era subsidies. The enhanced premium tax credits, which expanded eligibility and lowered costs, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Without an extension, many enrollees, particularly those with incomes just over the original threshold, will hit a "subsidy cliff," potentially causing their monthly costs to rise by hundreds of dollars. Financial experts advise those affected to begin planning now by projecting their income and exploring ways to reduce it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling in a case now before the Supreme Court threatens to nullify the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by stripping private individuals and groups of the ability to sue under it. If upheld, enforcement of the landmark civil rights law would fall solely to the Justice Department, which has historically brought only a small fraction of successful VRA cases. The legal theory, originating with Justice Neil Gorsuch, argues there is no "implied cause of action" for private litigants.

          <p>This contributor argues that the recent $150-billion increase to the Pentagon budget, pushing it over $1 trillion, will primarily enrich military contractors rather than enhance national security. The piece cites a report showing over half the Pentagon's budget goes to private companies, a figure that has grown significantly. The author contends this spending subsidizes overpriced weapons and fuels an arms race, while military personnel and veterans face cuts and financial hardship. The article calls for a strategic shift toward diplomacy and better support for troops over excessive spending on high-tech weaponry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that federal courts should recognize a legal privilege for patient-physician communications to shield transgender and reproductive healthcare information from government intrusion. The author notes that recent subpoenas from the Justice Department targeting providers of trans youth care aim to chill the provision of medical services, even if prosecutions are unlikely. While HIPAA offers some privacy, it has exceptions for legal demands like subpoenas. The contributor proposes that extending a court-created privilege, similar to attorney-client privilege, is a necessary step to protect patients' intimate medical data from political weaponization.</p>

Researchers measured two major stress pathways and found that while people with their dogs had lower levels of the long-term stress hormone cortisol, they also had a healthy spike in the short-term "fight or flight" enzyme alpha-amylase. This indicates a more balanced and effective physiological response to stress, keeping a person alert but not overwhelmed. The findings suggest dogs help keep their owners in an optimal zone for handling stressful situations.</p>
