          <p>Generative AI is set to fundamentally alter the online shopping landscape by integrating checkout capabilities directly into chat platforms like ChatGPT. This shift could allow consumers to search for and purchase items without ever leaving the AI interface, streamlining the sales cycle significantly. While this presents a potential disruption to established payment processors and e-commerce giants, many industry leaders are already partnering with AI firms to adapt. The new model emphasizes control over the 'pre-sale' phase, where AI guides consumer discovery and decision-making, shifting value from the final transaction to initial user attention.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a public safety emergency in Washington, D.C., placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to combat what he described as widespread crime and squalor. The move puts Attorney General Pam Bondi in command of the local police force as part of a broader initiative to "rescue our nation's capital." This action follows Trump's criticism of Mayor Muriel Bowser's handling of the city, although official police data indicates a year-to-date decrease in both overall and violent crime. The administration's plan also includes addressing homelessness and the general beautification of the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The program that compensates private attorneys appointed to represent indigent defendants in federal cases is facing a severe financial crisis after running out of congressionally approved funds. This shortfall means that thousands of these lawyers, known as CJA panel attorneys, are not being paid for their constitutionally mandated work, threatening the public defense system's viability. The funding gap is already causing trial delays and concerns that attorneys may be forced to decline cases, potentially creating a "justice gap" and violating defendants' rights. Without a congressional appropriation to cover an estimated $116 million deficit, the system's ability to function is at risk.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has announced that Anas Al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera journalist killed in an airstrike in Gaza, was the leader of a Hamas terrorist cell. According to the IDF, Al-Sharif was responsible for planning rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and troops, and his affiliation was proven by intelligence and documents found in the region. Al Jazeera condemned the killing as a "targeted assassination" and a premeditated attack on press freedom, stating that Al-Sharif was one of the last journalists providing on-the-ground coverage from within Gaza. The network and the journalist had previously denied any affiliation with Hamas.</p>

In the 1960s, she founded a software company, Freelance Programmers, that almost exclusively hired women and championed flexible, home-based work, revolutionizing opportunities for women in technology. Adopting the name "Steve" to navigate the male-dominated business world, she built a successful company and later dedicated her life to philanthropy. She donated most of her fortune, nearly £70 million, to autism research and IT projects, inspired by her late autistic son, Giles.</p>

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from sales of specific AI chips to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal, confirmed by the White House, allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export controls, to the crucial Chinese market. Analysts view the move as a transactional approach by the Trump administration and a net positive for the chipmakers, as receiving 85% of revenue is better than being shut out of the market entirely. The agreement raises questions about future U.S. policy and China's reaction to this new form of economic leverage.</p>

Forecasters indicate that the storm has the potential to strengthen and could become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season. Current models project the storm moving westward with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, though it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. This development aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season, with an expected 13 to 18 named storms, of which five to nine could intensify into hurricanes.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, financial experts are advising on the best placement for savings, specifically comparing high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) and certificates of deposit (CDs). HYSAs are recommended for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer easy access to cash without penalties. Conversely, CDs are better for maximizing returns, as they typically offer higher, fixed interest rates, which is advantageous if market rates are expected to fall. For those with larger sums, a strategy of splitting funds between both or using a CD ladder can balance the need for liquidity with the goal of higher earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

The research, which examined provision at the county level, found higher rates of pill requests in poorer counties and those farther from physical clinics.

          <p>Ford has announced plans for a new family of affordable electric vehicles, set to launch in 2027 with a midsize pickup truck targeted at a starting price of $30,000. The company is investing nearly $2 billion in its Louisville, Kentucky, plant to produce the new line, aiming to compete with the cost efficiency of Chinese EV makers like BYD. This initiative is being developed by a specialized "skunkworks" team and is central to Ford's strategy of making EVs profitable. The move addresses a key consumer concern about affordability and heats up the competition among automakers to deliver lower-priced electric models to the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Renowned venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly defended Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan after President Donald Trump called for his resignation, labeling the attack as "artless bullying" with "no modern precedent." In a Financial Times piece, Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, praised the CEO's track record and stated there is "no one better equipped to transform Intel's fortunes." Trump and other Republicans had raised concerns over Tan's ties to Chinese companies, which Tan addressed as "misinformation." The Intel board's defiance and Tan's scheduled visit to the White House signal an attempt to resolve the politically charged situation.</p>

          <p>The Spanish Football Federation has parted ways with women's national team head coach Montse Tome and appointed Sonia Bermudez as her successor. Tome, who led the team to a Women's Nations League victory but finished as runner-up in the Euros, will leave when her contract expires. The change is part of a broader effort by the federation's new leadership to create a fresh culture following past controversies. Bermudez, a former national team captain with an extensive playing career, moves up from her role as head coach of the U23s, though some question her level of experience for the senior role.</p>

          <p>Gary Grant, the founder of the UK's largest independent toy retailer, The Entertainer, is transferring 100% ownership of the multi-million pound business to his 1,900 employees. The move establishes an employee ownership trust, which will give staff a share of future profits and a say in how the company is run. Grant, who started the business with his wife in 1981, said the decision was made to preserve the company's family-oriented values and legacy, which a sale to another business might have compromised. The transition ensures the company's Christian ethos, including Sunday closures and charitable donations, will be maintained.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices have surged, with bitcoin retaking the $120,000 level and nearing its all-time high, while ether reached its highest point since 2021. The rally is attributed in part to significant buying during Asian trading hours, which some analysts link to the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, driving investment into hard assets. The recent launch of ether ETFs has also fueled its rise, with inflows recently surpassing those of bitcoin ETFs. This upward momentum in the crypto market has also boosted the stock prices of related companies, including Coinbase and various crypto miners. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new executive order from President Donald Trump grants political appointees broad authority over federal research grant funding, a move critics say threatens scientific independence. The order allows appointees to overrule scientific peer review and terminate grants based on political criteria, explicitly targeting research on topics like critical race theory and DEI. Scientists and research advocates have condemned the order as a "Soviet-style politicization of American science" that will replace merit with ideological loyalty. The move is the latest in a series of actions by the administration that have been viewed as hostile to the scientific community and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>In a notable shift in Malawi's political landscape, several presidential candidates for the upcoming election have nominated women as their running mates. This trend is occurring in a nation where women constitute over 57% of registered voters and follows advocacy campaigns for greater female representation in politics. However, analysts are cautiously optimistic, noting that most of these women are on the tickets of smaller parties, suggesting the move may be more symbolic than a genuine transfer of power. While the development is seen as a step toward gender inclusion, voters' decisions are still expected to be driven primarily by pressing issues like food shortages and the economy.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned President Trump that he will lead an effort to redraw his state's congressional maps if Republican-led states like Texas proceed with their own partisan redistricting. In a letter, Newsom proposed a cease-fire, offering to stand down if red states do the same, framing it as a way to protect American democracy from gerrymandering. The move escalates a national political battle over redistricting that could determine control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Newsom's plan would involve a special election where voters could approve new maps designed to make GOP seats in California more competitive.</p>

A Polish research team found his remains and over 200 personal items, which were identified through DNA analysis, bringing an unexpected closure to his family after 66 years.

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been rescued from the British Columbia wilderness after being missing for nine days. Andrew Barber survived his ordeal by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a makeshift shelter after his truck broke down on a remote forest road. A police helicopter located him after spotting his truck and then seeing "help" etched on a rock and "SOS" drawn in the mud nearby. Severely dehydrated and with a leg injury, he was taken to a hospital for treatment and has since been released, with rescuers noting he likely would not have survived another day.</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that men convicted of rape "probably forfeit the right to be the gender of their choice," a significant shift in her public stance. The comment was made in reference to the 2023 controversy over transgender offender Isla Bryson, who was convicted of two counts of rape and initially placed in a women's prison. In an interview for her new memoir, Sturgeon also admitted she was partly to blame for the debate over gender recognition laws losing rationality and that she should have paused the legislation. Her remarks have drawn criticism for being too late.</p>
