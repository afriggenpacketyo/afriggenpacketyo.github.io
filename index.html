          <p>The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies to temporarily suspend scheduling new student visa appointments as the Trump administration expands social media screenings for applicants, marking the latest restriction on international students. This pause will last until further guidance is issued, affecting all student visa applicants who may now be subject to social media checks. The expanded vetting process is expected to have significant operational implications for embassies and consulates. The administration cites concerns over national security and potential antisemitic activity as reasons for the enhanced scrutiny, raising concerns about academic freedom and international collaboration in education.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. The Chrisleys, known for their series "Chrisley Knows Best," were found guilty of conspiring to defraud Atlanta-area community banks to obtain over $36 million in personal loans and conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Trump communicated his decision to the couple's daughter, Savannah Chrisley, expressing hope for a swift execution of the pardon. The White House stated that the President is pleased to offer deserving Americans a second chance, particularly those unfairly targeted by the justice system.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but was lost during reentry due to a propellant leak that caused it to spin out of control. The upper-stage vehicle broke up as it fell back into the atmosphere, with debris landing in the Indian Ocean. While the ascent phase showed improvements over previous test flights, the loss of control during reentry highlights the challenges SpaceX faces in developing a reusable spacecraft for interplanetary travel. Elon Musk acknowledged the loss of the main tank pressure during the coast and reentry phase, but noted progress in other areas of the flight. The next three test flights are planned at a faster pace.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding employment, with their unemployment rate nearing 6%, surpassing the national average. This is attributed to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech industry. The report suggests that automation and artificial intelligence are impacting lower-level computer science jobs, leading to fewer opportunities for new graduates. Economic uncertainty and aggressive tariff policies are also contributing to the slowdown in hiring, potentially causing further increases in unemployment among recent graduates.

          <p>The CDC will no longer advise routine COVID shots for healthy children or pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing a lack of supporting data. This decision marks a significant shift from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone six months and older. While many agree the initial vaccination course offered protection against serious illness, the need for annual vaccines against new variants is debated. The change raises concerns among public health experts about the risk to vulnerable populations, especially infants and pregnant women.</p>

          <p>A judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting WilmerHale, an elite law firm, marking another legal victory for firms resisting the administration's pressure. The judge deemed the order unconstitutional, stating that Trump intended to impose severe sanctions to force the firm into negotiations. This decision supports the strategy of fighting back against the administration's actions, as other firms have also successfully challenged similar orders in court. The ruling emphasizes the importance of an independent judiciary and bar willing to tackle unpopular cases.</p>

          <p>Families in Northumberland, England, are facing distress as their homes, acquired for a road widening project that was later cancelled, have been left empty and deteriorating. National Highways spent over ¬£4 million purchasing properties for the A1 scheme, which was approved and then scrapped, leaving the homes vacant and in disrepair. The affected families express heartache over losing their homes and witnessing their deterioration, while authorities are criticized for the waste of resources and lack of a clear strategy for the unneeded properties. The Crichel Down rules dictate the properties should be offered back to their original owners, however, all three families said they do not wish to go back to the homes, which have been empty for several years.</p>

          <p>Maya Lau, a former Los Angeles Times reporter, has filed a federal lawsuit against Los Angeles County and former Sheriff Alex Villanueva, alleging a violation of her First Amendment rights. The lawsuit claims that a criminal investigation into her reporting on a leaked list of deputies with misconduct records was designed to intimidate and punish her. Lau seeks damages for violations of her dignity, privacy, and the anxiety she has faced since the investigation was revealed. The Sheriff's Department, under new leadership, has stated its commitment to upholding the Constitution and respecting the role of journalists.</p>
