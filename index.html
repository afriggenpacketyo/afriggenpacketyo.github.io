          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, his former lawyer, as acting librarian of Congress, leading to a staff revolt. Library staff refused access to Justice Department officials chosen for key roles, leading to a standoff. Democrats criticized the move as a "power-hungry assault" on the legislative branch. The Library of Congress houses important research services and the Copyright Office, and this action has raised concerns about executive overreach and political control over a nonpartisan institution, as the White House accused the previous librarian of placing 'inappropriate books in the library for children'.</p>

          <p>A group of white South Africans arrived in the US after being granted refugee status under a plan supported by President Trump, who claimed they were victims of "racial discrimination". This move has drawn criticism, with accusations of hypocrisy due to the suspension of other refugee admissions. The South African government denies any persecution meriting refugee status. Critics argue Trump's administration is pushing a racially charged narrative. The US has criticized South African policies regarding land redistribution from white farmers, and the country's ambassador to the US was expelled after accusing President Trump of using "white victimhood as a dog whistle".</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's attempt to fire Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) board members, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sought to review CPB's operations.

The CPB is challenging Trump's removal of board members in court, arguing that it would lack a quorum to conduct business, and the organization is saying that without a quorum, the board would also be unable to enact Trump's executive order allegedly seeking to defund PBS and NPR.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is under fire for blurring the lines between public office and personal enrichment, exemplified by the plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar. This follows instances like raking in money from wealthy business interests hoping to curry his favor and launching a meme cryptocurrency that enriches his family. Additionally, the administration has disbanded a Justice Department unit investigating cryptocurrency crimes and suspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These actions have raised concerns about the erosion of ethical norms and the exploitation of public office for private gain, which is further exacerbated by Trump pressuring law firms to donate to his causes and extracting money from tech companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, solidifying his position in the upcoming primary. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has openly courted Trump's support after initially distancing himself. The endorsement could be a liability in the general election, as New Jersey leans left and Trump remains a polarizing figure in the state. Democrats are also engaged in a competitive primary, and the race is expected to be closely contested, given Trump's improved performance in New Jersey in the November election.</p>

Some conservatives argue this gives parents a choice, while Democrats criticize resistance to policies that support working mothers. Studies are unclear whether children fare better in day care or at home, and many American families need two incomes to survive, making the debate complex and multifaceted.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is considering accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One, raising ethical and national security concerns. Critics argue this could be seen as bribery and a violation of the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause. The plan is that the plane would ultimately belong not to the U.S. government but to Trump, and that after he leaves office, it would reportedly “be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation no later than Jan. 1, 2029, and any costs relating to its transfer will be paid for by the U.S. Air Force”. Accepting an aircraft from a foreign country, even an ally, raises many questions about national security, and the Qataris would presumably not give Trump such a plane out of the goodness and generosity of their hearts.</p>

In the United States, an estimated 10,000 additives are allowed in the food we eat, but the FDA allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior approval. The food industry is often vetting the safety of the ingredients in our food, not federal regulators. Researchers estimate that there are roughly1,000 chemicalsin the food supply whose identities are unknown to regulators, and most safety studies examine single chemicals in isolation, not how the hundreds or thousands of chemicals we consume might interact with one another or affect our long-term health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs for 90 days, leading to a surge in stock prices. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both saw significant gains, with tech companies particularly benefiting. Starting May 14, both countries will lower tariffs, bringing the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% and China's rate on American goods down to 10%. While investors cheered the agreement, they also warned that the market rally could falter as the end of the tariff pause approaches in August, and the value of the dollar climbed against other major currencies.</p>

The Tulsa County District Attorney sought a life sentence, but the judge ordered Babudar's sentence to run concurrently with his federal sentence.

The letter calls for Trump to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill, which they argue would make America more competitive and bring jobs back to the country.

          <p>President Trump invoked the golfing great Sam Snead to justify his plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar to use as Air Force One. Trump compared accepting the plane to taking a "gimme" putt in golf, saying that only a fool would turn down such an offer. This justification follows criticism of the ethical and legal concerns surrounding the acceptance of the plane from a foreign government. Trump said that he’d be a “stupid person” to turn down the Qatari plane, and that it was an echo back to one of his earlier ethical snafus.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices, but its details and long-term effects are unclear. Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US, claiming prices would fall almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. Experts are highly skeptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect. The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status – meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.</p>
