          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-03 09:19:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Charity Commission will investigate Sentebale, a charity co-founded by Prince Harry, following allegations of bullying, harassment, and financial mismanagement.  The investigation stems from a dispute between the charity's chair, Sophie Chandauka, and the former trustees, including Prince Harry, who resigned amidst accusations of an abuse of power.  The inquiry will examine compliance with charity law and assess various financial concerns, including the reported expenditure of £500,000 on US consultants.  The outcome of this investigation is highly anticipated, particularly given the public profile of Prince Harry and the charity's mission.</p>

          <p>The UK government approved plans to expand Luton Airport, increasing its capacity to 32 million passengers annually by 2043.  This decision comes despite the Planning Inspectorate's recommendation to reject the proposals due to environmental concerns.  The expansion project includes a new terminal and taxiways, promising significant economic and employment benefits for Luton.  However, environmental groups are likely to challenge the decision, raising concerns about increased carbon emissions and noise pollution.</p>

          <p>Carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious, often fatal, hazard resulting from the inhalation of odorless, colorless gas produced by burning fossil fuels.  The CDC reports hundreds of annual deaths and thousands of hospitalizations, highlighting the importance of prevention.  Key safety measures include installing carbon monoxide detectors on each floor, regular servicing of fuel-burning appliances, and safe generator use.  Travelers should also be aware of potential risks and consider using portable detectors, especially in less regulated accommodations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports, impacting nearly all U.S. trading partners.  The tariffs, ranging from a 10% baseline to significantly higher rates for specific countries, have drawn strong criticism from global leaders.  While many expressed concerns about the economic consequences and potential for a trade war, there's also a recognition of the importance of maintaining trade relations with the U.S.  The long-term effects of these tariffs on global markets and economies remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam is expected to significantly impact major U.S. retailers and brands that heavily rely on Vietnamese manufacturing. Companies like Nike, Adidas, Deckers Brands, and VF Corporation, which source significant portions of their products from Vietnam, face increased costs.  The furniture and toy industries are also vulnerable.
