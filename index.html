          <p>A Maryland judge refused to grant the Trump administration another delay in providing information regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order preventing it. Judge Paula Xinis criticized the administration's "bad faith refusal" to answer questions and ordered expedited discovery, accusing the government of obstructing the process with unsubstantiated claims of privilege. Senator Chris Van Hollen has also been vocal, urging recognition of Abrego Garcia's constitutional right to due process and warning against unchecked presidential power. The Trump administration defends its actions, citing Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and claiming he is not under U.S. control, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserted executive branch authority over foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge found Apple in contempt of court for willfully violating an injunction in an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple continued to impede developers' ability to communicate with users and levy new commissions on off-app purchases, despite a 2021 order to lower barriers protecting its exclusive payment system. The judge accused Apple executives of lying under oath and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for investigation of potential criminal contempt proceedings. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has proposed a peace proposal to Apple if the court's framework is extended worldwide.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly holding back on engaging in serious trade negotiations with the United States, awaiting clarity on which of President Trump's advisors will ultimately influence trade policy. Sources indicate that China perceives the Trump administration as "too divided" on trade matters, with conflicting views among key advisors like Peter Navarro, Robert Lighthizer, and Scott Bessent. Beijing is hesitant to reveal its negotiating position without knowing who its primary counterpart will be, and what the ultimate US strategy will be. Meanwhile, Yuyuan Tantian, a social media account linked to Chinese state media, suggested that the U.S. has recently sought to contact China to initiate trade talks.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a top trade advisor to President Trump, stated that the White House is pursuing a trade deal with India with urgency. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed this sentiment, suggesting a deal is near. These comments come as skepticism grows regarding Trump's ability to execute bilateral trade agreements amid concerns about the impact of tariffs on American businesses and economic growth. U.S. gross domestic product experienced a decline in the first quarter, attributed to policy uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed that one trade deal had already been finalized, but he did not disclose the country involved.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board members have reportedly contacted executive search firms to identify a successor for CEO Elon Musk, prompted by his heavy involvement with the Trump administration. Musk has faced criticism for his work at the Department of Government Efficiency, leading to investor concerns. His embrace of far-right politics has also sparked protests and vandalism at Tesla showrooms. The board has met with Musk, urging him to publicly commit to spending more time at Tesla.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared divided over the effort to create the nation's first religious charter school in Oklahoma, which could open the door to public funds flowing directly to religious schools. Justices Alito and Kavanaugh expressed sympathy for the school's argument that excluding it from the charter system is unconstitutional discrimination. Liberal justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson voiced concerns about weakening the separation between church and state. The decision hinges on Chief Justice Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in charter schools during arguments.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert, Qi Xiangdong, warned that excessive reliance on artificial intelligence for decision-making could pose a security risk, exposing users to hackers. He stated that large AI models bring security challenges, as hackers can exploit vulnerabilities or manipulate the model's decisions. Qi also cautioned that erroneous information introduced during knowledge base updates could contaminate the model's learning environment. His warning comes amid a nationwide AI frenzy over China's home-grown chatbot DeepSeek, which authorities have backed as a success for the country's innovation drive.</p>

The preliminary vote supports increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent for two-year leases. Tenant advocates expressed concern that the increases would harm lower-income residents, while landlords argued that the increases were insufficient.
