          <p>The UK government aims to eliminate the significant backlog of driving tests by next summer.  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced plans to increase the number of available tests by 10,000 per month.  This initiative seeks to reduce average waiting times to seven weeks by summer 2026, though this is eight months behind the original target. The measures include doubling training capacity for examiners and reintroducing overtime pay incentives.</p>
