          <p>President Vladimir Putin led Russia's Victory Day commemorations in Moscow, joined by China's Xi Jinping, underscoring the strengthening ties between the two nations amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Putin used his speech to link the war in Ukraine to the lessons of World War II, emphasizing Russia's role as a barrier against Nazism and Russophobia, while Xi's presence highlighted China's increasing significance on the global stage. The parade featured military hardware and contingents from North Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia, signaling Russia's pivot towards the East and its defiance of Western isolation efforts. Ukraine rejected Russia's unilateral ceasefire offer, labeling it a theatrical show.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 06:08:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite tariffs imposed on imported aluminum by the U.S. government, domestic aluminum production is not reviving, primarily due to soaring electricity prices, which render U.S. smelters uncompetitive. The tariffs have led to higher costs for American consumers, as the regional delivery premiums reflect the tariff cost, while European premiums are significantly lower. Major U.S. producers like Alcoa and Century Aluminum have been forced to close or idle smelters due to the high cost of power, with energy costs for U.S. smelters significantly higher than those in Canada. The rise of artificial intelligence and data centers is further exacerbating the problem by increasing demand for electricity.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have agreed to a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the two countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum, though this is not a comprehensive trade agreement. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped, though quotas will be imposed. Pharmaceuticals remain a key area of negotiation, and the UK's digital services tax remains a point of contention, with the US expressing disappointment over the UK's unwillingness to fully address the tax.

          <p>Democratic leaders have strongly criticized President Trump's abrupt firing of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, through an email notification. Hayden's tenure was praised for modernizing the Library and increasing accessibility, but she had faced criticism from conservative groups for promoting certain children's books and literary material. Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer condemned the firing as unjust and part of Trump's effort to ban books and whitewash American history. The Library of Congress holds a vast collection of books, historical documents, and artifacts.</p>

          <p>A hawkish lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shoji Nishida, has apologized and retracted controversial remarks he made about exhibits at a war memorial in Okinawa. Nishida had suggested that the exhibits rewrote the history of the Battle of Okinawa, implying that Japanese soldiers were responsible for the deaths of the Himeyuri student corps. His comments sparked criticism from people in Okinawa and fellow lawmakers, leading to his apology and retraction. The Himeyuri student corps refers to over 200 female students and teachers who died during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is holding a bail hearing for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate detained by immigration authorities after the Trump administration revoked her student visa due to alleged criticism of Israel and participation in pro-Palestinian protests. Ozturk's attorneys argue her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, and Tufts president Sunil Kumar has defended her, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her. Ozturk alleges she has suffered multiple asthma attacks in ICE detention and received limited medical attention. A federal appeals court ruled the Trump administration must comply with a district court's order to transfer Ozturk to immigration custody in Vermont.</p>

While lifestyle changes like exercise and a healthy diet are crucial, many face challenges due to lack of education and access to healthy options.

He emphasizes that behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning experiences, rather than being solely determined by DNA. The article explores how seemingly instinctive behaviors, such as nest-building in birds, are influenced by the animal's body, environment, and past experiences. The neuroscientist also highlights the importance of understanding the systems in which animals function, rather than focusing solely on their minds.</p>

          <p>Despite distancing himself during the campaign, President Trump's policies closely align with Project 2025, an ultraconservative playbook, prompting criticism and warnings. The Trump administration has pursued aggressive immigration enforcement, downsized the federal workforce, restricted voting, defunded public media, and targeted transgender people. Experts suggest this reflects a coordinated effort to implement a conservative agenda, while the White House maintains Trump acts in the best interests of Americans. Critics argue these policies threaten democracy and push the nation toward an authoritarian, Christian nationalist regime.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are expressing concern over President Trump's cuts to federal funding for addiction treatment programs, which threaten to undermine progress in combating the fentanyl crisis in Los Angeles. While fatal opioid overdoses have decreased, experts attribute this to harm reduction strategies like increased naloxone availability, which are now at risk due to funding cuts. Local authorities are also re-embracing a traditional approach to fighting drug crime, including stricter penalties, which some fear will lead to mass incarceration and further marginalize vulnerable communities. The experts emphasize the importance of continuing harm reduction efforts and treating substance use as a chronic condition rather than a crime.</p>

A renewed expansion of the child tax credit would also help alleviate the financial burden on families and drastically cut the child poverty rate.
