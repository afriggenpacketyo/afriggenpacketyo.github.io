          <p>A Pew Research Center analysis of federal data reveals that two-thirds of Americans who get divorced eventually remarry, with men being slightly more likely to do so than women. The study highlights significant economic benefits for those who remarry, as their median household wealth is comparable to those in their first marriage and substantially higher than that of divorced, single adults. While remarriage often brings renewed clarity and foresight, some experts caution that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among those over 50.</p>

          <p>Dr. Corey Miller, a Christian apologetics organization leader, suggests that a form of cultural Marxism taught in universities is fostering ideological intolerance and contributing to a hostile political climate. He connects this educational trend to recent violent events, arguing that it devalues human life and frames inequality as injustice, thereby motivating extreme actions. The article notes that several studies support the claim of declining academic freedom and increased difficulty in discussing politics on campus, with Miller advocating for more open debate rather than censorship.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has confirmed that team captain and England defender Marc Guehi will not sign a new contract and intends to leave the club next year. The 25-year-old's current deal is set to expire at the end of the season, and he has declined an offer to extend his stay. This decision leaves Crystal Palace with the option of selling Guehi during the January transfer window to receive a fee or allowing him to leave as a free agent next summer.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that it is no longer constrained by the restrictions of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark nuclear deal with world powers has officially expired. The agreement, which had capped Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, faced jeopardy for years, notably after the U.S. withdrawal in 2018. Despite the expiration and stalled negotiations to revive the deal, Tehran stated its firm commitment to diplomacy, even as European powers recently triggered the reinstatement of international sanctions over Iran's violations.</p>

          <p>Players from Oviedo and Espanyol conducted a 15-second on-field protest by refusing to play at the start of their match, opposing La Liga's decision to schedule a game in Miami. The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) coordinated the symbolic action, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league regarding the plan to move a Villarreal vs. Barcelona fixture to the U.S. This protest is part of a wider discontent among players and some clubs in Spain, with the AFE demanding the creation of a negotiating table to address their concerns.</p>

          <p>The first T20 cricket match between England and New Zealand in Christchurch was washed out by rain, preventing New Zealand from beginning their chase.

Curran scored an unbeaten 49 from 35 balls, rescuing the team from a difficult position of 81-5 and helping them reach a competitive total on a challenging pitch.

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump called for Kyiv and Moscow to end the war and "stop where they are," suggesting both sides could claim victory. This position marks a shift, implying Russia could keep the territory it has seized, and came after Trump also signaled hesitation in providing Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a key request from Kyiv. Zelenskyy acknowledged the need to stop the fighting and begin negotiations but sidestepped questions about conceding territory, highlighting the complex diplomatic path ahead.</p>

          <p>Johnathan Walton, a podcaster whose work was instrumental in the conviction of international con artist Marianne "Mair" Smyth, has expressed disappointment with her four-year prison sentence in Northern Ireland. Smyth was convicted of defrauding four people of over $155,000 while working as a mortgage adviser before fleeing to the U.S., where she also scammed Walton. Walton, who chronicled his experience in the "Queen of the Con" podcast, believes the sentence is too lenient for a serial fraudster who he says will never change her ways.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's opposition Christian Democrats (CDU), has firmly rejected any cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), labeling them the party's "main opponent" in upcoming elections. Amid calls from some within his party to reconsider the "firewall" against the AfD, Merz stated that the far-right party's goal is to destroy the CDU. His comments come as the AfD continues to show strength in polls, a rise Merz attributes partly to the migration policies of former Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that the current high tariff rates on Chinese goods are "not sustainable," even as he defended his administration's tough stance on trade. The statement comes as the U.S. and China prepare for a new round of trade negotiations next week, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia. The talks aim to de-escalate the ongoing trade war and find a path forward before a current tariff truce agreement is set to expire in November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test could significantly accelerate cancer diagnosis by detecting over 50 different types of cancer, many of which currently lack screening programs. The trial, conducted in North America, found that the test successfully identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with more than half of these cases being caught at an early, more treatable stage. The test works by identifying fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, and if results from an ongoing NHS trial are also successful, it could be rolled out more widely.</p>
