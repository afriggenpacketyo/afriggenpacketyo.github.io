          <p>Amid a national trend towards stricter policies, Los Angeles County is embracing harm reduction with its new Skid Row Care Campus. The facility provides clean syringes, naloxone, and addiction treatment, aiming to save lives without requiring immediate sobriety. This strategy contrasts with calls for more punitive measures and is part of a broader, taxpayer-funded campaign to combat the county's significant homeless crisis, despite facing political debate and opposition.</p>

          <p>The debate over the health effects of seed oils like canola and soybean has intensified, with some public figures claiming they are harmful. However, many nutrition scientists argue these claims are overstated, pointing to studies showing that replacing saturated fats with plant oils improves health outcomes. While seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, research does not consistently show this promotes inflammation in the body. Experts generally agree that reducing consumption of ultra-processed foods is more important than avoiding the oils themselves.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to spend the holiday weekend at his New Jersey golf club has drawn sharp criticism on social media amid the deadly flooding in Texas. Many critics contrasted his recreational activities with the ongoing tragedy, where at least 81 people, including children, have died. While the President did issue a statement and sign a disaster declaration for the affected area, his actions were seen by some as insensitive and out of touch with the national crisis.</p>

          <p>The trial of Erin Patterson, convicted of murdering three family members, hinged on key evidence that dismantled her claim of an accidental poisoning. The prosecution highlighted her false claim of having cancer to lure the guests, her use of a different plate, and her disposal of a food dehydrator containing mushroom traces. Despite the defense arguing a lack of motive, the jury was convinced by a pattern of lies and concealment that pointed to a deliberate and calculated act.</p>

          <p>A federal trial is underway in Boston to address a lawsuit claiming the Trump administration has unconstitutionally targeted noncitizen students and faculty for arrest and deportation due to their pro-Palestinian activism. University associations allege this policy violates First Amendment rights and has created a chilling effect on free speech. The government denies the existence of a formal policy, arguing that its actions fall within its legal immigration enforcement powers.</p>

          <p>Recent videos show French police wading into the water to slash inflatable boats carrying migrants, including women and children, attempting to cross the English Channel to the UK. This aggressive tactic comes as France is under pressure from the UK to toughen its approach to stop the record pace of crossings. While the French Interior Ministry states there are no orders to systematically slash boats, rights groups warn that such actions could endanger lives and lead to more desperate measures by migrants.</p>

          <h2>Cautious Optimism Surrounds Gaza Ceasefire Talks as Israeli PM Netanyahu Visits Washington</h2>

          <p>As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with President Trump, there is cautious optimism for a breakthrough in Gaza ceasefire negotiations. A US-sponsored proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release is on the table, though key differences between Israel and Hamas remain. The recent war between Israel and Iran is seen as having shifted regional dynamics, potentially creating more favorable circumstances for a deal, but Palestinians and Israeli hostage families remain wary after previous talks failed.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old grandmother from Aylesbury is at risk of losing her home after withholding approximately £5,000 in council tax for over three years. Jane McCarthy's protest is aimed at pressuring Buckinghamshire Council to divest its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. A court has granted the council a Final Charging Order on her property, which could be used to force a sale to recoup the owed amount, highlighting a clash between civic duty and climate activism.</p>

          <p>On the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, the city remembers the 52 people killed and over 770 injured in the coordinated terrorist attacks on its public transport system.
