        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier owner Richemont announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by robust demand for jewelry. Revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, totaling 5.17 billion euros, exceeding analysts' forecasts, with the Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, leading the growth. However, sales in specialist watchmakers experienced a decline, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, with full-year sales rising 4% to 21.4 billion euros. Richemont's chairman cautioned about ongoing global uncertainties requiring agility and discipline, while BofA Global Research noted potential headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is actively debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, a move that has seen significant revisions since its initial passage. The debate, broadcast live by the BBC, includes discussions on amendments ensuring no obligation for medical staff to participate and preventing doctors from discussing assisted death with under-18s unless initiated by the patient. A government impact assessment, quietly corrected, projects NHS savings but faces criticism for its "chaotic" process. With strong opinions on both sides, the bill has split Parliament, with a final approval vote unlikely before June 13, highlighting the complex ethical and societal implications of assisted dying.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to a framework that would allow the UAE to purchase advanced AI semiconductors from American companies, according to U.S. President Donald Trump. This agreement could involve the import of 500,000 Nvidia H100 chips annually, which would significantly boost the UAE's AI development capabilities. The move comes as the Trump administration plans to potentially rescind a Biden-era rule that imposed strict export controls on AI chips, raising concerns about the technology ending up in the hands of rivals like China. The UAE has been investing heavily in AI infrastructure, aiming to become a global technology hub.</p>

          <p>Japan's equities and long-term bonds saw record foreign inflows in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets amidst trade tensions initiated by President Donald Trump. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of Japanese assets, marking the largest net inflows since 1996, according to Morningstar. This shift was attributed to changing global investor outlook on the U.S. economy due to tariff shocks. With the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact future inflows into Japanese markets. The inflows were largely driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers.</p>

This move comes as the UK's trade relationship with China is under scrutiny, particularly regarding supply chain security.

While headline tariffs were reduced, these cuts largely reversed measures that were non-compliant with WTO rules, indicating that no true bilateral deal was struck.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7% annualized contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in a year, according to government data. This contraction was attributed to sluggish domestic demand and increased import costs, even before the full impact of higher U.S. tariffs. Private consumption saw a slight increase, but inflation outpaced wage hikes, while exports fell due to a decline in intellectual property rights and R&D services. Economists anticipate further slowdowns, contingent on trade negotiations with the U.S. aimed at reducing tariffs.</p>

This contrasts sharply with his domestic policies, where he is pursuing investigations into political opponents and using executive power against critics. Trump has lifted sanctions on Syria and met with Ahmed al-Shara, a former rebel leader with ties to Al Qaeda, signaling a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, while maintaining a hard line against perceived enemies within the United States.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly collapse of a Bangkok high-rise during the March 28 earthquake, construction magnate Premchai Karnasuta and others surrendered to police on criminal negligence charges. The collapse, which resulted in 92 confirmed deaths, prompted an investigation that revealed the building plan did not meet standards and codes, citing structural flaws and substandard materials. Premchai, already convicted of wildlife poaching in 2019, faces further legal scrutiny. The case has also highlighted the involvement of a Chinese joint venture partner and allegations of irregular documentation.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has declared victory in its recent military clash with India, which has boosted public confidence in the state and military. Despite analysts suggesting the conflict was closer to a draw, the perception of holding its own against India has temporarily overshadowed Pakistan's political, economic, and security challenges. The military, led by Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has seen a rehabilitation of its image, though this support could wane if the military is perceived as overreaching in politics. Challenges remain in addressing internal security threats and economic struggles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is investigating James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, for an Instagram post that officials claim amounted to a call for President Trump’s assassination. The post, which showed seashells forming the numbers “86 47,” was interpreted as a reference to removing Trump from office. Comey took down the post and said he did not intend it as a call for violence. High-level Trump administration officials denounced the post, and the F.B.I. is supporting the investigation.</p>
