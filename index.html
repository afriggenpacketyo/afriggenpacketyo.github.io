          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a contentious Republican-backed bill to redraw the state's congressional maps, sending it to Governor Greg Abbott who has promised to sign it swiftly. The legislation, which followed a weeks-long standoff with House Democrats who fled the state in protest, aims to create five new GOP-leaning districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In response to this move, which critics argue dilutes minority voting power, California has initiated its own counter-plan to flip Republican seats.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, who have been incarcerated for decades for the 1989 murder of their parents, were both denied parole this week. Parole commissioners cited the brothers' behavior in prison, rather than the murders themselves, as the primary reason for the denial. The hearings revealed issues such as involvement in fights, drug use, and repeated violations involving prohibited mobile phones, which officials said demonstrated a continued struggle with anti-social traits like deception and rule-breaking.</p>

          <p>Despite its policies against hate speech, the popular gaming platform Roblox is struggling to contain extremist content, a CBS News investigation found. In the game "Spray Paint!", users are able to bypass moderation by painting swastikas and racist slurs on virtual surfaces, exposing the platform's large youth user base to harmful messages. The issue is part of a broader problem for Roblox, which faces numerous lawsuits over inappropriate content and accusations that it prioritizes growth over child safety.</p>

          <p>Multiple national postal services across Europe, including those in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, are suspending most merchandise shipments to the United States. The halt is a response to a new Trump administration decree that subjects goods previously exempt from U.S. tariffs to new import duties starting August 29. European postal operators cite a lack of clarity on the new rules and insufficient time to update their systems to ensure compliance before the deadline.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has fulfilled a lifelong goal by receiving his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by the severe abuse he suffered at Florida's notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne attended the brutal reform school in the 1960s and later dropped out of high school to support his family. He was able to earn his diploma through a state compensation program for victims of abuse at Dozier, and he hopes his story inspires others to overcome obstacles and never give up.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a recent survey found that Americans believe the ideal retirement age is 58, this is significantly younger than the current average and comes with substantial financial risks. Financial advisors caution that retiring this early could mean needing to fund a 30 to 40-year period without work, making individuals vulnerable to outliving their savings, especially during economic downturns. Additionally, early retirees must account for the years before Medicare eligibility at age 65, highlighting the need for aggressive saving and careful planning to make such a goal feasible.

He suggests that while space exploration with robots is valuable for science, the focus on colonization is a delusion, and humanity's efforts should be directed at making our own planet a better place.</p>

Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions involving dark patches on the skin that are more common in people of color. The key ingredient is iron oxide, which gives the sunscreen its tint and blocks this type of radiation, making it a more effective choice for individuals concerned with these specific skin issues.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, resumed its eruption on Friday, with its north vent shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air. The activity, which is the 31st such display since December, is currently contained within the summit crater and poses no threat to homes. The eruption provides a spectacular show for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, with scientists explaining that the dramatic fountains are caused by gas-rich magma rising rapidly through narrow vents.</p>

          <p>Utility bills are rising across the U.S., with electricity costs up 5.5% over the last year, largely due to a surge in demand after decades of flat growth. This increased demand is driven by power-intensive technologies like AI data centers, oil and gas drilling, and electrified transportation, coupled with a shortage of transmission infrastructure to connect new energy sources to the grid. While President Trump has blamed renewables, analysts point to these demand factors and administration policies that curtail cheaper clean energy projects as key drivers of the rising costs.
