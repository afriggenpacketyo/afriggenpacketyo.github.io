          <p>Solar stocks experienced a sharp decline after the U.S. Senate's version of President Trump's tax bill maintained cuts to renewable energy incentives. The bill proposes phasing out solar and wind power tax incentives by 2028 while preserving incentives for nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy for a longer period. This move is seen as a setback for renewable energy investments, despite being considered an improvement over the House-passed version, which was even more unfavorable to the Inflation Reduction Act's tax incentives. Raymond James analysts noted that wind and solar eligibility continue to face pressure under the Senate proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

Katz also claimed that Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúreplacement chief of staff‚Äù was killed in recent Israeli strikes on Iran overnight.

          <p>President Trump has stated that he seeks a "real end" to Iran's nuclear program, insisting on the complete cessation of its enrichment activities, rather than just a ceasefire with Israel. Trump suggested Israel would continue its assault on Iran, which has reportedly decimated Iran's military command and significantly damaged its nuclear program. He also warned Tehran to avoid targeting U.S. forces, promising a severe response if they do so. Trump indicated he might send envoys to meet with Iranian negotiators, though he expressed reluctance to negotiate at this time.</p>

They cite the lack of local manufacturing capabilities and the impracticality of designing a phone from scratch in the U.S. Francisco Jeronimo from International Data Corporation stated that it is "completely impossible" for the phone to be assembled or completely manufactured in the U.S.</p>

About 10% of Kraft Heinz's U.S. items use these synthetic additives, which include brands like Crystal Light, Kool-Aid, MiO, Jell-O, and Jet-Puffed. This decision follows pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to reduce artificial dyes in food, aligning with the 'Make America Healthy Again' platform. The FDA plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year, replacing them with natural alternatives.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a class of targeted cancer therapies, could eventually replace chemotherapy and its harsh side effects. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs. While it may take years for ADCs to fully replace chemotherapy, some companies believe they have already demonstrated the ability to do so in certain settings, with AstraZeneca leading the way towards establishing ADCs as a precision-based approach.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's promise of "the largest deportation program in American history," his administration has not reached the deportation numbers of President Barack Obama. Obama's administration deported 438,421 people in 2013, a record Trump has yet to surpass. Obama's strategy included increasing penalties for unauthorized border crossings and deputizing local law enforcement to target immigrants with criminal records. Trump faces challenges in replicating Obama's strategy due to fewer border crossings and increased opposition in liberal areas to cooperating with federal immigration authorities, despite his efforts to implement workplace raids and mobilize federal resources.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted a mass missile and drone attack on Kyiv, Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 people and injuries to over 100 others. A drone struck an apartment block, destroying numerous flats, and Ukrainian officials reported that the country was hit by hundreds of drones and missiles. The attack, one of the largest on the capital since the start of the war, prompted residents to seek shelter underground. Ukraine's interior minister stated that residential, critical infrastructure, and educational facilities were targeted in the strikes.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company," explores how Apple's relationship with China transformed the country into a manufacturing powerhouse. The book details how Apple's demand for meticulous manufacturing and cutting-edge designs led to significant investments and training for the Chinese workforce. By 2012, Apple's investment in machinery in China reached $7.3 billion, and the company estimates it has trained at least 28 million workers since 2008. This transformation has raised questions about whether Apple inadvertently contributed to the geopolitical rise of one of America's biggest adversaries.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump departed the G7 summit in Canada early to address the situation in the Middle East, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to reduce the pace of its government bond-buying beyond next year while maintaining interest rates, signaling a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid trade and economic uncertainties. Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concern about the outlook for Japan's economy, citing U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes as a downside risk. The BOJ will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026, down from the current 400 billion yen.
