        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has unilaterally terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, a decision he announced on social media. The move was prompted by a Canadian government-sponsored advertisement that featured a 1987 clip of former President Ronald Reagan speaking out against trade tariffs. Trump's action comes as he continues to impose a 35% levy on many Canadian imports and as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule on the legality of his global tariffs. The Ronald Reagan Foundation has criticized the ad, stating it misrepresents the former president's remarks.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing significant challenges in establishing its inquiry into grooming gangs, as finding a willing and suitable chairperson proves to be exceptionally difficult. Even highly experienced candidates, such as former child protection chief Jim Gamble, have declined the role, highlighting its complexity and controversial nature. The government acknowledges that any appointee with the necessary expertise will likely face criticism from some victim groups. This difficulty is compounded by disagreements among abuse survivors regarding the role of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, underscoring the deep mistrust and pain surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed the Department of Justice that she believes there is insufficient evidence to proceed with a mortgage fraud case against Senator Adam Schiff. This development comes after President Donald Trump publicly called for the California Democrat, a prominent critic, to be criminally charged. According to MSNBC, Hayes conveyed her assessment to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, although Blanche has since denied that the meeting took place. Schiff’s legal team has condemned the investigation as a baseless and politically motivated effort to intimidate a political opponent.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines grounded all its flights nationwide on Thursday night following a significant, system-wide IT outage that affected its operations. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the temporary ground stop at the airline's request, which also impacted its regional carrier, Horizon Air. The technical failure led to numerous cancellations and delays, with at least 39 flights canceled and over 240 delayed by late evening. While the airline stated it was actively working to restore its systems, the ongoing outage was expected to cause further disruptions into the following day.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has finalized its plan to open the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration, reigniting a contentious environmental debate. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the decision, which fulfills a key promise by President Trump to allow lease sales in the 1.5 million-acre area. The move is praised by some Alaskan officials for its economic potential but is fiercely opposed by environmental groups and the Indigenous Gwich'in people, who consider the land sacred and vital to the caribou herds they depend on. Conservation groups have vowed to challenge the decision in court.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to host a summit in London with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and over 20 allied nations to advocate for increased military support for Ukraine. Starmer will press allies to provide more long-range missiles, enabling Ukrainian forces to strike strategic targets deep within Russian-held territory. The push for advanced weaponry follows a successful Ukrainian strike on a Russian chemical plant using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. The summit aims to build on recent diplomatic momentum, including new U.S. sanctions against Russia, to pressure Moscow towards negotiating an end to the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned 'surge' operation by federal agents in San Francisco, following a direct appeal from Mayor Daniel Lurie and prominent tech executives. The president stated that the mayor asked for a chance to demonstrate the city's progress in addressing public safety issues, which Lurie supported with new data showing a nearly 30% drop in crime. The decision marks a reversal of the administration's plan to expand its nationwide immigration crackdown to the Bay Area. While San Francisco officials expressed relief, leaders in nearby Oakland remained wary, as they had not received similar assurances from the White House.</p>

          <p>Germany's commitment to close a legal loophole that complicates the prosecution of smugglers trafficking migrants to the UK may be delayed beyond its 2025 target. The proposed law would make it explicitly illegal to facilitate smuggling to a third country, a necessary clarification after Brexit. However, the German interior ministry has only committed to introducing the bill by the year's end, without guaranteeing its passage, leading to concern among some British officials. This potential setback could frustrate the UK government, which has been pressing Berlin to toughen its laws as part of a broader international strategy to stop small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is threatening to halt the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially cutting off food aid for nearly 42 million Americans by November 1. This disruption could trigger the most severe hunger crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression, impacting children, seniors, veterans, and working families. While the USDA has some contingency funds, advocates argue the department is legally obligated to continue funding the entitlement program.

The trend, dubbed 'Operation Inflation,' began in Portland and uses humor to undermine claims that cities are 'war zones' requiring federal intervention.

          <p>Attorneys for New York Attorney General Letitia James are moving to dismiss the bank fraud indictment against her, arguing that the prosecutor overseeing the case was unlawfully appointed. Her legal team contends that interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment violates federal law regarding term limits for such positions. Additionally, James's lawyers have accused Halligan of improper conduct for sending unsolicited text messages to a journalist criticizing her coverage of the case. They argue this action violated Justice Department rules and could prejudice James's right to a fair trial ahead of her scheduled arraignment.</p>

          <p>The FBI has launched an investigation after a driver in Arizona allegedly rammed a vehicle carrying two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. The incident occurred when the officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop, but the suspect reportedly fled the scene. Authorities allege the driver then returned to a residence and intentionally drove his vehicle into the occupied ICE vehicle. The FBI will lead the investigation and refer its findings to the U.S. Attorney’s Office to determine if federal charges will be filed.

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has issued a direct warning to Russia over a significant increase in submarine activity, stating that Russian naval presence in UK waters has risen by 30%. Healey declared, 'We're hunting your submarines,' emphasizing that the RAF and Royal Navy have intensified surveillance missions in the North Atlantic, where Russian activity has returned to Cold War levels. The warning comes amid growing concerns that Russia may attempt to sever critical undersea communication cables as a form of hybrid warfare. The UK is deepening its defense cooperation with Germany to counter these threats.</p>

          <p>In a rare and politically charged move, several states including Texas, California, Missouri, and North Carolina are redrawing their congressional maps mid-decade to secure partisan advantages ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The effort, initiated by President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more GOP-friendly seats, has prompted a retaliatory push by California Democrats. These gerrymandering efforts are already facing legal challenges, with civil rights groups suing over alleged racial bias in Texas and other lawsuits filed in Missouri. This aggressive redistricting gambit aims to manipulate district boundaries to bolster the parties' respective majorities in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, the man accused of starting the devastating Palisades fire, has pleaded not guilty to three federal arson charges in a Los Angeles court. The fire, which occurred earlier this year, resulted in 12 deaths and the destruction of over 6,800 structures. Prosecutors allege that Rinderknecht started a smaller fire on January 1 that smoldered underground for days before erupting into the massive blaze. Investigators have cited geolocation data from his phone and his online search history as evidence. If convicted, the 29-year-old Florida man faces a prison sentence of five to 45 years.</p>

The jury found the operating company, LaSalle Management Co., and three guards liable for negligence, battery, and excessive force. Security footage showed guards forcefully taking Moore down and later dropping him on his head. Moore, who was experiencing a mental health crisis, was then held in a camera-less area for two hours without medical attention before being found unresponsive.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's rapid transition to clean energy is a direct result of its long-term strategic vision, enabled by a political system that ensures policy continuity. Unlike the partisan shifts seen in the U.S., where support for renewables can change with administrations, China has consistently pursued decarbonization goals, such as its west-to-east power transmission program. Since committing in 2021 to peak carbon emissions by 2030, China has aggressively expanded its renewable energy capacity. The author suggests this consistent, state-driven approach has allowed China to become a dominant force in the global green energy landscape.</p>

The burglars stole eight pieces of historic jewelry valued at an estimated €88 million after scaling a balcony and breaking into the Apollo Gallery.
