          <p>President Trump has requested congressional funding for a comprehensive missile defense system for the United States, dubbed the "Golden Dome," inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles strategically placed throughout Israel, which has successfully intercepted thousands of rockets. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to America's larger size and the different types of missiles it would need to defend against, likening the difference to that between a kayak and a battleship. This initiative aims to enhance national security by providing a robust defense against potential missile attacks. The prospect of enhanced protection contributes to a sense of security. </p>

          <p>Overnight Russian strikes on Kyiv have resulted in at least 14 deaths and dozens of injuries, marking one of the largest bombardments of the capital since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukraine's interior minister reported that a total of 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched at the country, while Russia claims to have intercepted 147 Ukrainian drones. The strikes, lasting over nine hours, targeted residential areas, including a nine-story apartment building, leading to extensive damage and trapping residents under rubble as rescue teams continue their efforts amidst ongoing sirens. The recent intensification of Russian air attacks employs tactics designed to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, underscoring the failure of direct talks to secure a ceasefire. The sheer destruction and loss of life cast a pall over the situation.</p>

          <p>China displayed a scale model of its J-35A, a land-based variant of its fifth-generation fighter jet, at the Paris Air Show, marking its first overseas showcase. Developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), the J-35A is China's second fifth-generation fighter jet after the J-20, which is not available for export. While the original J-35 is intended for use on Chinese aircraft carriers, the J-35A is designed for the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Air Force and reportedly first flew in September 2023. China aims to boost export sales of its fighter aircraft, particularly in developing countries in the Middle East and South Asia, despite limited sales in the European market due to political and military relations with the US. The demonstration of advanced military technology highlights China's growing influence in the global arms market.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Options for Addressing the Israel-Iran Conflict</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been marked by ambiguity, ranging from strong support for Israel's strikes to distancing himself from them, further complicated by his early departure from the G7 summit. As the conflict escalates, Trump faces several options, including escalating military involvement under pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining the current course of limited involvement, or pulling back based on "America First" principles advocated by some of his supporters. Netanyahu has consistently pushed for military action, while some advisors caution against escalating the conflict, and voices within the MAGA movement question the risk of U.S. involvement in another Middle East war. The decision hinges on balancing international pressures, domestic support, and his own objectives regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. The array of possibilities contributes to uncertainty surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>G7 leaders have called for a de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza, but stopped short of demanding a ceasefire between Israel and Iran during their summit in Canada. The joint statement, signed by President Trump before his early departure, affirmed Israel's right to self-defense and condemned Iran as a source of terror that should not possess nuclear weapons. Trump's early departure, attributed to events in the Middle East, fueled speculation about potential U.S. involvement in the conflict, though American officials denied any immediate plans to join Israel's offensive. Despite divisions, the G7 leaders agreed on a statement that preserved unity while addressing the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. The call for resolution and de-escalation reflects a cautious approach to a volatile situation.</p>

          <p>A joint United Nations and World Food Programme report warns that Haiti is among 13 global hot spots facing a worsening hunger crisis, with a potential famine without urgent intervention. The report attributes the crisis to conflict, economic shocks, and climate risks, highlighting that gang violence in Haiti has displaced thousands and left over 8,000 people facing severe hunger. Residents in Port-au-Prince report going without food for days and receiving no government support, with one woman describing the famine as so severe that she and her children are on the brink of death. The report predicts further food crises in the next five months, noting that insecurity and funding gaps are undermining aid delivery.

          <p>President Trump has signaled a potential escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict by leaving the G7 summit early, stating that he had "much bigger" things to address than planning a ceasefire, and urging Iranians to "immediately evacuate Tehran." G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel while calling for de-escalation in the Middle East and condemning Iran as a source of regional instability. Trump's remarks followed French President Macron's suggestion that Trump had offered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which Trump denied. Meanwhile, Israel claimed to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander, further intensifying the conflict. The early departure and strong rhetoric suggest a potentially more assertive U.S. role in the escalating crisis.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to further reduce its monthly government bond purchases beyond April of next year, but at a slower pace, while maintaining its interest rate at 0.5 percent. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen ($1.4 billion) per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, with the total amount of purchases declining to about 2 trillion yen in early 2027. Amid uncertainties stemming from President Trump's higher tariffs, the BOJ is taking a prudent approach to normalizing monetary policy. This decision follows the BOJ's earlier moves to end a decade of unorthodox monetary easing and introduce a quantitative tightening program.

          <h2>Shipping Companies Avoid Strait of Hormuz Amid Israel-Iran Conflict</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, some shipowners are choosing to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, a critical gateway for the world's oil industry and container ships. Bimco, representing global shipowners, notes a "modest drop" in ships sailing through the area due to increasing concerns and uncertainty. The Strait of Hormuz is vital for oil flows, accounting for about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption, and is also key for global container trade, serving as a transshipment hub for ports in the region. The conflict has led to a jump in freight rates, with Mideast Gulf tanker freight rates to China surging 24%, reflecting the perceived risk in the area. The decision to reroute highlights the significant impact of geopolitical instability on global trade and energy markets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed between the two countries last month. The order will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year, and also removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. While the deal does not address the removal of charges on steel imports, the UK government stated it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed". Prime Minister Starmer hailed the move as a "very important day" for both countries, and a "sign of strength" between Britain and America. The implementation of the tariff reductions is seen as a positive step for UK businesses.</p>

          <p>President Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, returning to Washington, D.C., citing "what's going on in the Middle East." He denied that his early return was related to any ceasefire talks between Israel and Iran, despite French President Macron's earlier comments. Trump stated that he had "spoken to everybody" regarding Israel and Iran and believed a deal would be signed, while also urging Iran to negotiate before it was too late. The U.S. has stated that it is not joining Israel's military offensive, though it has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles.

Without dramatic action, England will face a daily shortage of more than six billion liters by 2055, requiring customers to cut their water use from an average of 140 to 110 liters per person per day. The EA emphasizes the need for water companies to reduce leaks, invest in new infrastructure, and switch customers to smart meters with variable pricing. The report highlights the growing population and climate change as key drivers of the deficit. The call for action underscores the importance of water conservation.</p>
