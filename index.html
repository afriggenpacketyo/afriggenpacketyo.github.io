          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Greenland is seen as a show of European unity and a response to President Trump's attempts to acquire the island.  The visit includes meetings with Greenland's and Denmark's prime ministers and focuses on security, climate change, and critical minerals.  The move is interpreted as a signal of support for Greenland and a counter to US pressure.  Tensions between the US and Denmark remain high.</p>
