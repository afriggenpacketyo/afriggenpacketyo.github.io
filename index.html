          <p>A decorated Marine combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient, Nigel Edge, has been charged with killing three people and wounding five others at a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina. Authorities allege the 40-year-old opened fire with an assault rifle from a boat in what they describe as a "highly premeditated" attack. The suspect, who reportedly suffers from PTSD and has a history of filing lawsuits, was arrested shortly after the incident and allegedly confessed to law enforcement. This event has prompted North Carolina's governor to call for improvements to the state's mental health care system, highlighting the challenges faced by some veterans.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the 33-year-old founder of the student financial aid platform Frank, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for fraud. Javice was found guilty of grossly inflating her startup's user base to secure a $175 million acquisition by JPMorgan Chase in 2021. The bank later discovered that Frank had fewer than 300,000 real customers, not the more than 5 million that were claimed, with the rest being fabricated data. The case serves as a cautionary tale for the banking giant, which pursued the acquisition amid a competitive push into the fintech sector without fully verifying the startup's customer numbers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to intensify into a hurricane but is projected to move away from the southeastern United States. As of Monday, the storm was bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the northwestern Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center predicts Imelda will turn east-northeastward, approaching Bermuda by mid-week but sparing the U.S. mainland from a direct hit. Despite its path away from the coast, swells generated by the storm are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast, prompting safety warnings for coastal areas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has announced it will delay the release of economic data if a federal government shutdown occurs, casting doubt on the publication of this Friday's highly anticipated jobs report. According to the department's contingency plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection and the issuance of economic reports. This development creates uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, which relies on such data to make crucial decisions regarding interest rates. A lack of timely information on the labor market could complicate the Fed's ability to gauge economic health and influence its upcoming policy meeting.</p>

          <p>The White House is warning that several Veterans' Affairs (VA) programs are at risk of expiring if Senate Democrats block a short-term government funding bill passed by House Republicans. The memo highlights critical services such as nursing home care, suicide prevention grants, and mental health services that could be halted. Democrats have stated they will not support the bill unless it includes extensions for expiring Obamacare premium subsidies, creating a partisan impasse.

          <p>President Trump stated that a government shutdown is probable unless Democrats concede on their demands, expressing confidence that the public will support his position. In an interview, he framed the issue around spending cuts and border security, criticizing Democrats for not being interested in addressing "fraud, waste and abuse." The president is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders from both parties to negotiate a spending bill ahead of the October 1 deadline. However, his remarks suggest a firm negotiating stance and a willingness to allow government funding to lapse if his administration's terms for further spending cuts are not met.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a critical meeting with President Trump, Democratic congressional leaders have reiterated they will not support a government funding bill without concessions on healthcare. Their primary demand is the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which are set to expire. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated that his party will not back a "partisan Republican spending bill" that he argues harms the healthcare of Americans. This firm stance sets the stage for a contentious negotiation, with both sides deeply entrenched in their positions as the shutdown deadline approaches, making a compromise appear increasingly difficult.</p>

Health officials attribute the resurgence of this highly contagious disease to declining vaccination rates, with kindergartener vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold needed for community immunity.

This move comes as coal's share of U.S. electricity generation has fallen to about 15%, displaced by natural gas and renewable energy.

          <p>DoorDash is significantly expanding its partnership with Kroger, the nation's largest grocery chain, to offer delivery from over 2,700 U.S. locations. Previously limited to sushi and flowers from select stores, the collaboration will now include Kroger's full range of fresh food, household essentials, and other items. This development makes Kroger the largest grocer available on the DoorDash app and reflects the delivery company's growing focus on the grocery sector. The move aims to provide more convenience for existing Kroger customers while potentially attracting new households through DoorDash's extensive user base of 42 million monthly active users.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals America's National Flood Insurance Program is Financially Unsustainable</h2>

          <p>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides essential coverage for millions of homeowners, is facing a severe financial crisis as climate change increases the frequency and cost of flooding. The program is over $22.5 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury, and its structure creates a moral hazard by subsidizing insurance in high-risk areas, which can encourage development in floodplains. Experts argue the system is unsustainable, as it is caught between the conflicting mandates of keeping rates affordable and remaining fiscally sound. This growing problem points to a difficult future reckoning over who should bear the rising costs of climate-related disasters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, dropping from nearly 35 million this year to a projected 34 million in 2026. Health insurers are cutting back on unprofitable plans and exiting some markets after facing shrinking profits due to higher-than-expected medical costs and new regulations. As a result, seniors may face higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for 2026 plans. Insurers are also reducing or eliminating broker commissions on many plans, which could make it harder for seniors to find and enroll in certain types of coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

He delivered in the clutch moment, sparking euphoric celebrations and cementing his place in Ryder Cup history. The performance was a moment of redemption for Lowry, who was part of the European team that suffered a record defeat in 2021, and highlighted his importance to the team's chemistry and success.</p>

          <p>In a rare address to the United Nations General Assembly, a high-ranking North Korean official unequivocally stated that Pyongyang will never surrender its nuclear weapons. Kim Son Gyong, the vice minister of foreign affairs, asserted that demanding denuclearization is equivalent to demanding a surrender of the nation's sovereignty and right to exist. This defiant statement reinforces North Korea's official policy, which constitutionally enshrines its status as a nuclear state. While the speech closed the door on denuclearization, it follows recent comments from leader Kim Jong Un suggesting a potential openness to talks with the U.S. under certain conditions.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks even if the federal government shuts down on October 1. Because the program is funded through mandatory spending, payments to the 74 million Americans who rely on them are not subject to the annual appropriations process. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is at risk, which could disrupt customer services. According to the agency's contingency plan, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards could be temporarily halted until funding is restored, potentially causing delays and inconvenience for many beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced new tariffs of 30% on imported upholstered furniture and 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, set to take effect on October 1. Industry analysts predict that these levies will lead to higher prices for consumers, potentially deterring home renovation projects. The tariffs are expected to disproportionately affect low-income consumers, as lower-cost furniture is often imported. Retailers and manufacturers may be forced to pass on the increased costs, and the policy creates uncertainty that could hinder business investment and expansion plans within the home goods industry.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey offered blunt advice to a caller who had amassed a $1.1 million portfolio by investing in just a few successful stocks. Ramsey called her strategy "unsustainable" and warned of the significant risk associated with having a fortune concentrated in only four companies. He strongly recommended that she sell the stock, pay the associated capital gains taxes, and reinvest the proceeds into a diversified portfolio of mutual funds. This approach, he argued, would spread the risk across many different investments, providing greater stability and protection against a catastrophic loss if one of the individual companies were to falter.
