          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring who said she was abused as a teenager, has died at 41 by suicide. Her family described her as a fierce warrior against sexual abuse and sex trafficking, a light for many survivors. Giuffre had accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault, reaching a settlement in 2022 with no admission of liability. In March, she posted that she was days away from dying of renal failure after a car crash with a school bus, though authorities disputed the severity of the crash. Her death highlights the long-lasting impact of sexual abuse and trafficking on survivors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced a third round of nuclear negotiations in Muscat, Oman, aiming to revive a landmark agreement and de-escalate regional tensions. The talks focus on Iran's nuclear program and the potential easing of sanctions, with expert-level discussions addressing technical issues like monitoring facilities and uranium enrichment. Conflicting signals from US officials and deep mistrust persist, but Iran has signaled a willingness to return to enrichment levels consistent with the 2015 accord. A successful agreement could curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, lower the risk of Middle East conflict, and potentially transform Iran's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at the Rajaei port in southern Iran has resulted in multiple fatalities and hundreds of injuries, with authorities investigating the cause.

Simultaneously, Iran and the United States are engaged in nuclear negotiations in Oman, addressing concerns over Tehran's nuclear program.

          <p>A parenting coach warns against using the phrase “You’re okay” when children are upset, arguing that it can invalidate their emotions and hinder their ability to process feelings. The phrase can teach children to doubt their own emotions, dismiss their experiences, and short-circuit emotional processing. It can also lead children to believe that love is conditional upon suppressing emotions, potentially rewiring a child’s stress response. Instead, parents should acknowledge and validate their child's feelings to promote emotional safety and resilience.</p>

          <p>Russia's military claims that all Ukrainian troops have been forced out of the Kursk region, a statement unconfirmed by Ukrainian officials. Russian Chief of General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov reported the news to President Vladimir Putin, who congratulated the soldiers. Ukraine launched an offensive into the border region in August of last year, taking control of an estimated 500 square miles of land. Also, Gerasimov confirmed that North Korean soldiers fought against Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region, taking part in "combat missions shoulder to shoulder with Russian servicemen during the repelling of the Ukrainian incursion".</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump met inside St Peter's Basilica ahead of Pope Francis' funeral. The White House described the 15-minute meeting as "very productive" and Zelensky later called it "very symbolic" with the "potential to become historic". The meeting came a day after Trump said Russia and Ukraine were "very close to a deal", following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday. Two images of the men showed Trump in a blue suit, Zelensky wearing a black top and trousers - with the two men sitting opposite each other having an intense conversation and holding serious expressions.</p>

          <p>Upcoming local elections in England are poised to reveal a fragmented political landscape with multiple parties vying for power.

The elections will test the campaign strategies of each party and highlight the increasing volatility of voter allegiances. The results could also lead to more councils with no overall control, requiring parties to collaborate and potentially forcing the Conservatives to consider working with Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress face a challenging task in uniting behind President Trump's request for a "big, beautiful bill" that would enact his campaign promises. The bill's proposed tax cuts, border defenses, and spending reductions have exposed divisions within the GOP, particularly regarding social safety net programs. Experts predict the bill could significantly increase the federal deficit, testing the resolve of lawmakers who prioritize fiscal responsibility. The budget framework has separate targets for the House and Senate, further highlighting the challenges of reaching a consensus.</p>

The changes are linked to a goal of prioritizing funding for chronic disease programs, but some experts warn that dismantling vaccine infrastructure will negatively affect efforts to improve public health overall.
