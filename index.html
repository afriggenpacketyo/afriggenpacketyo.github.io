          <p>China has successfully launched the Shenzhou-20 spacecraft, carrying a three-person crew to the Tiangong space station for a six-month mission. The crew, including commander Chen Dong and first-time astronauts Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie, will conduct experiments on superconducting materials and biochips for brain organoids. Additionally, they will deploy and retrieve payloads and install devices to protect the station from space debris, aiming to enhance space station safety and contribute to advancements in space-based research and technology. This mission underscores China's commitment to expanding its presence and capabilities in space exploration. The research could have implications for regenerative medicine and understanding human health issues in space. </p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is launching an investigation into the Trump administration's plans to downsize the Department of Education, expressing concern over the potential impact on students, parents, and teachers. Warren sent letters to education and civil rights groups, including the NAACP and NEA, seeking information on how abolishing the department would affect access to affordable, high-quality public education. She argues that the department plays a crucial role in protecting civil rights, funding programs for students with disabilities, and distributing financial aid. The investigation aims to gather stories from those affected and defend public education through oversight, storytelling, and potential lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Norway's sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management, reported a first-quarter loss of $40 billion, primarily attributed to weakness in the technology sector. CEO Nicolai Tangen cited significant market fluctuations as the cause of the negative return on equity investments. The fund's value decreased by 1.215 trillion kroner due to adverse currency movements, with the krone strengthening against major currencies. While equities experienced losses, fixed income investments showed a positive return of 1.6%, and unlisted real estate yielded gains of 2.4%.</p>

          <p>A trade policy expert at the Brookings Institution suggests that unpredictable US trade policies could incentivize countries to forge stronger relationships with China as a buffer against instability. Joshua Meltzer notes that countries are seeking alternative partnerships to mitigate the risks associated with US trade uncertainty. China is poised to capitalize on this situation by positioning itself as a reliable alternative partner. The extent of this trend will depend on whether the Trump administration can stabilize its trade policies, and if other countries believe that the U.S. will become more predictable in its trade relationships with them.</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced a downturn after Chinese officials refuted claims of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. Stocks in Asia and Europe mostly declined, and futures for the S&P 500 indicated a lower opening in New York. The market volatility reflects investor sensitivity to trade-related comments from President Trump, with a sharp sell-off followed by a rally earlier in the week. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce stated that reports of progress in trade negotiations were baseless rumors, reiterating China's position that the tariff war was initiated by the United States.</p>

The Microsoft case, which centered on the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows, established legal principles for addressing monopolistic behavior by tech companies.

          <p>Indonesia intends to import more goods from the United States in an effort to reduce its trade surplus with the country, according to Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. This decision comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Indonesian exports. Indonesia is considering increasing imports of agricultural products, such as wheat, soybeans, and corn, as well as oil and gas, particularly liquid gas. While trade with the U.S. accounts for a relatively small portion of Indonesia's GDP, the country aims to diversify its exports in response to potential impacts from U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The value of Donald Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, increased by over 50% after the official website announced a private gala dinner with the president for the top 220 holders. Despite this surge, the coin's value remains significantly below its peak before Trump's inauguration. The jump occurred amid expectations of an unlock allowing early investors to cash out, which was delayed by 90 days. While Trump was initially skeptical of cryptocurrency, he has since embraced it, even hiring a crypto tsar and supporting growth in the sector.</p>
