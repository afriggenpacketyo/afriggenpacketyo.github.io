          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured during a second night of violence in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at officers, resulting in five arrests. Riot police used baton rounds and water cannons to disperse the crowds as cars were set ablaze and homes were damaged. A mother-of-two is considering moving her family back to Bulgaria after their home was damaged, expressing fear for her children's safety amidst the escalating tensions. First Minister Michelle O'Neill condemned the violence, while police officials cited critical underfunding and urged reflection from those involved. The incident has sparked concerns about racism and illegal immigration within the community.</p>

Refinance applications rose 16% for the week, while purchase applications increased by 10%, driven by loosening housing inventory. Despite economic uncertainty, homebuyers are taking advantage of increased housing supply in certain markets, though rates have remained in a narrow range for months. (not investment advice)</p>

A key factor is an EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15%, leading to increased corporate sales.

          <p>Two years after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, the landscape is reverting to its natural state, with lush vegetation and diverse wildlife returning. The Dnipro River has reformed vast floodplains, resembling the area before the dam's construction in the 1950s. However, the future of this ecosystem is uncertain, as Ukraine considers rebuilding the hydroelectric power plant, which could destroy the newly formed landscape. While engineers argue the plant is vital for water supply and energy, ecologists advocate for preserving the area as a national park.</p>
