          <h2>USAID Cuts in Africa Lead to Healthcare Crisis and Potential Deaths</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to USAID funding are severely impacting healthcare in Africa, leading to shortages of medication, halted healthcare programs, and potential deaths. HIV patients are losing access to vital antiretroviral drugs, and other programs addressing tuberculosis and malaria are also facing setbacks. The pan-African NGO Amref Health Africa has experienced significant budget losses, resulting in canceled educational programs and reduced screenings. Experts fear that these cuts could undo years of progress in disease prevention, potentially leading to millions of preventable deaths and a resurgence of infectious diseases, but some African countries are stepping in to fill the gaps.</p>

          <p>Germany and Israel are marking 60 years of diplomatic relations, overshadowed by the ongoing war in Gaza and rising antisemitism, especially among young people in Germany. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is visiting Berlin to commemorate the anniversary with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, including a visit to the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial. The visit occurs during the new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who acknowledges Germany's special responsibility for Israel's security. Despite criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians have repeatedly emphasized Israel's right to defend itself after the Hamas attacks in 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. Exports of this technology have surged 153% from 2020 to 2024, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. This trend aligns with China's global shift from fossil fuels to renewables, further boosted by a 2021 commitment to halt funding new coal-fired power plants overseas.</p>

          <p>President Trump is commencing his first foreign trip of his second administration with a Middle East tour, aiming to secure investment, trade, and technology deals from Gulf allies. Negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE will cover oil, trade, regional conflicts, and the Iran nuclear program. Trump's primary objective is to prioritize American interests by securing multi-billion dollar deals and investments in the US economy. The trip notably excludes a visit to Israel, and the Israel-Gaza war will significantly influence discussions, particularly regarding Saudi Arabia's normalization conditions and aid deliveries to Gaza.</p>

Ross criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatrists to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to stop questioning whether they are good enough. She offers a lighthearted quiz to illustrate that imperfections are normal and acceptable in motherhood.</p>

Experts suggest that unless Charles can resolve the family's internal divisions, it could negatively impact his reign and undermine his efforts to promote tolerance and inclusiveness.

          <p>The Trump administration and European officials are at odds over food safety standards, with the U.S. pushing for greater access for American meat products in Europe, while the EU insists on maintaining its strict regulations. European officials consider their food, health, and safety standards a "red line" in trade negotiations, particularly regarding hormone-treated beef and acid-washed chicken. The EU is protective of its smaller family farms and food culture, contrasting with the larger-scale agricultural businesses in the U.S. This disagreement is a major obstacle in broader trade discussions between the two regions.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become a political influencer due to his strong support for President Trump, despite facing hostility from many of his fellow Greenlanders. Boassen's advocacy for closer U.S.-Greenland ties has made him a key figure in discussions about the island's future and potential independence from Denmark. His transformation began with social media posts supporting Trump, leading to connections with Trump advisors and a role in promoting U.S.-Greenland relations through a nonprofit organization. While his views are not widely shared in Greenland, he believes closer ties with America offer the best path forward for the island.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba of Japan is hesitant about cutting the consumption tax as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing concerns about the negative impact on state finances. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling party have also expressed reservations about such a move, as the government prepares an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election. While opposition parties support a consumption tax cut, Ishiba emphasizes the need for thorough discussions on alternative ways to support those most in need, and affirms that Japan will continue to seek the complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>
