          <h2>Chinese Goods Subject to Increased Tariffs Arrive at US Ports Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>The first container ships carrying Chinese goods hit with President Trump's increased tariffs have arrived at U.S. ports, impacting companies like Amazon, Home Depot, and Tractor Supply. These tariffs, exceeding 145%, are causing confusion and uncertainty for businesses, leading them to continually alter their scenario planning and freezing other business decisions. According to the article, many companies priced and sold their products before the tariff amounts were announced, making it impossible to change pricing on items arriving in May and June. Trump has suggested a willingness to lower tariffs to 80%, but this rate would still be considered extremely high by many businesses, and the number of freight vessels and shipping containers headed to the U.S. from China has plummeted since the tariff announcement.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the first Jewish administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from Jewish environmental activists. These activists argue that Zeldin's role in weakening environmental regulations contradicts the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, the obligation to repair the world. While Zeldin maintains his policies are based on law and science, critics argue that reducing environmental protections harms Jewish values. The article highlights the differing interpretations of how Judaism addresses environmental protection, with some defending Zeldin's actions as consistent with economic growth and others condemning them as a desecration of Jewish values.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to 80% from the current 145% ahead of high-stakes trade talks in Switzerland. This announcement caused stock markets to open higher.

Economists have warned that Trump's tariffs are increasing the chances of a recession in the United States, and many companies are already facing financial pressure due to the existing levies.</p>

The US has previously described Afrikaners as victims of "racial discrimination" and has accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, allegations that South Africa denies. While South African authorities said they would not block the departures of those chosen for resettlement, they sought assurances from the US that those selected had been fully vetted and did not have pending criminal charges.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that the outage, which affected communications and radar displays at a facility in Philadelphia, lasted about 90 seconds. This incident follows a similar outage last week that caused widespread flight delays and cancellations, prompting the Transportation Secretary to announce a plan to modernize the country's air traffic control system. United Airlines, which counts Newark as a major hub, has expressed frustration with the ongoing issues, calling for the FAA to reverse a 2016 decision that loosened limitations on the number of flights scheduled at the airport.</p>

          <p>California cities, counties, and school districts are facing a financial crisis due to a wave of child sexual assault litigation spurred by a 2019 state law that expanded the number of lawsuits that can be filed against public institutions. The law, known as Assembly Bill 218, has led to numerous multimillion-dollar judgments and settlements, pushing some entities to the brink of bankruptcy. While victims and their lawyers view the litigation as long-overdue compensation, communities are grappling with the diversion of public funds to pay for past abuses. A state agency estimates that school districts alone face up to $3 billion in claims related to the law, and some districts may not survive.</p>

Manufacturers are dealing with the shock of tariffs on products and are very willing to invest in supply chains, but it takes time and investment. The rising cost of parenthood has some parents turning to resale platforms, boosting demand for discounted open-box goods or overstock inventory.</p>

On TikTok, money-saving hacks such as "no buy," "slow buy," and "low buy" have skyrocketed in popularity, especially among young adults. These challenges encourage shoppers to cut out non-essential purchases or adopt a more mindful approach to buying decisions, aiming to break the habit of overspending as fears of a recession rise.</p>

          <p>Newark airport, one of the main hubs serving the New York City area, experienced another blackout of its air traffic control system, the second in recent weeks. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that a key air traffic control facility in Philadelphia that guides aircraft in and out of Newark Liberty international airport had a malfunction, with radar going black for 90 seconds. The FAA said earlier this week that it is installing new fiber optic data lines to carry the radar signal between its facilities in Philadelphia and New York, as some of the lines connecting those two facilities are outdated copper wire.</p>

          <p>A small group of Republicans is threatening to derail President Trump's tax agenda over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a long-standing political challenge. These lawmakers, representing high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, are demanding the lifting of the $10,000 limit on SALT deductions, which they view as essential for their constituents. However, any change to the SALT cap would be incredibly expensive, potentially jeopardizing the overall Republican budget for tax cuts. While some Republicans support raising the limit, agreeing on a specific demand has been a challenge, with various proposals ranging from $30,000 to $200,000.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of three color additives from natural sources for manufacturers to safely use in food. This move comes amid growing concerns about the health effects of food dyes, which has led to action at state and national levels. The newly approved additives include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract (expanded use), and calcium phosphate. While the administration's goal is to replace petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives, the FDA has stopped short of an outright ban, instead accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed conflicting views on raising taxes on the richest Americans, while openly wrestling with the politics of such a move. Trump initially stated that he would "graciously" accept a "TINY" tax increase for the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers. However, he then expressed concern that Democrats would use this against Republicans, ultimately suggesting that Republicans should "probably not do it," but then adding, "I'm OK if they do!!!" The White House press secretary later clarified that Trump wants "the largest tax cuts in history," but would not mind personally paying a little bit more to help the poor and middle class.</p>

          <p>A report by German news weekly Der Spiegel alleges that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, known as the "Butcher of Lyon," was deeply involved in setting up one of South America's most important drug cartels and worked with Pablo Escobar. Barbie, living under the alias Klaus Altmann, became a security advisor to drug baron Roberto Suarez and helped advise the Bolivian security services. He also helped organize the militias that would overthrow the government in the run-up to the violent 1980 coup that brought Garcia Meza to power. A CIA dispatch from May 1974 reveals that the agency's officers already suspected Barbie of involvement in the drug trade.</p>
