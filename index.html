          <p>A team of Chinese scientists is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a nearly 2,000-year-old seismoscope invented by polymath Zhang Heng. The device, described in historical texts as an ornate jar with dragons that drop bronze balls to indicate an earthquake's direction, has been debated by scholars and was even removed from China's curriculum. Using modern science and new evidence, the researchers hope to restore the legendary invention's reputation and prove its sophisticated capabilities in early seismic detection. The project highlights a blend of ancient ingenuity with contemporary scientific validation.</p>

The project, a partnership between WWE and production company Words + Pictures, reportedly includes over 20 hours of interviews with Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea. This film is separate from a previously discussed biopic that was set to star Chris Hemsworth. The documentary is expected to offer fans a final, in-depth look at the career and life of the wrestler credited with significantly boosting WWE's global popularity.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it would begin airdropping aid and establishing humanitarian corridors for UN convoys into Gaza, responding to intense international pressure over the territory's catastrophic hunger crisis. The move comes as reports of starvation-related deaths, particularly among children, have sharply increased, with UNICEF warning its therapeutic food supplies are nearly depleted. Despite the announcement, aid officials like UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini have criticized airdrops as inefficient and a distraction from the need to open land routes. The humanitarian crisis continues to worsen as ceasefire talks have stalled.</p>

          <p>New research has detected nanoplastic particles in human brain tissue for the first time, raising significant concerns about their long-term health effects. A University of New Mexico lab found a higher concentration of these micro-pollutants in the brains of people with dementia. These particles, which originate from degrading plastic products, enter the body through food, water, and air. Ongoing clinical studies are already linking nanoplastics to a range of health issues, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, fertility problems, and cognitive abnormalities, prompting experts to call for reduced plastic use.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were evacuated after being stuck inside a tunnel for over six hours. A power failure shortly after departure caused the train to stop, leading to a loss of air conditioning and partial lighting in the warm tunnel. The rescue operation was prolonged when some passengers attempted to leave on foot, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety. All passengers were eventually evacuated via emergency exits and buses, with two receiving on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis came as a relief, as a more severe injury could have ended his season. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 to 14 days before potentially returning as a designated hitter. He first felt pain after making a strong throw from the outfield in a game earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne, this article reflects on the cultural impact of the early 2000s MTV show "The Osbournes," which redefined celebrity reality television. The series presented the Black Sabbath frontman not as a rock god but as a relatable, bumbling father, creating a format that producers called a "reality sitcom." By blending the family's mundane daily life with their extraordinary fame, the show pioneered a genre that paved the way for future hits like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." The article notes how the show's unscripted, fly-on-the-wall approach captured a genuine family dynamic that resonated with millions of viewers.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. This weather pattern has resulted in persistent cloud cover and drizzle, a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, forecasters caution that the region's hottest months, September and October, are still to come.</p>

The recall campaign had targeted 24 opposition lawmakers, accusing them of being "pro-China" and undermining national security. Since winning a parliamentary majority in early 2024, the opposition has consistently blocked President William Lai's agenda. The failure of the recall vote means President Lai will likely face an emboldened, opposition-controlled parliament for the remainder of his term, amid rising military pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord convicted of murdering 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and attempting to murder his mother, has died in prison. Czuba was sentenced to 53 years for the hate-crime attack, which prosecutors said was motivated by the victims' Islamic faith and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal stabbing in October 2023, where the boy was stabbed 26 times, drew international condemnation and heightened fears of anti-Muslim violence. The cause of Czuba's death has not been released, but his passing closes a painful legal chapter for the community.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas from Burbank made a sudden, rapid descent of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision with another aircraft. The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when the pilots received an onboard traffic alert. The other aircraft was identified as a decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. Comedian Jimmy Dore, who was a passenger, described the aggressive maneuver as causing people to fly out of their seats. No customers reported injuries, and the flight continued to its destination safely, but the FAA is now investigating the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's broad use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs is facing significant legal challenges, with a key case heading to a federal appeals court. A lower court previously ruled that the president exceeded his authority, a decision that threatens numerous trade deals and tariffs implemented under the law. Analysts suggest that if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against the administration, it could invalidate many of its recent trade actions, including agreements with the UK and reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. The White House maintains it is using its legal authority to protect national security. (not investment advice)</p>

During his visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The visit underscores the geopolitical importance of the Maldives, which is strategically located along key Indian Ocean shipping lanes, a focal point of competition between New Delhi and Beijing.</p>

          <p>England's hopes of securing a victory against India in the fourth Test are clouded by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes' fitness. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on the fourth day, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick confirming he was "a bit stiff and sore." Stokes has a history of injury issues, including recent hamstring and knee surgeries, and his heavy bowling workload this series is a growing concern. His absence from the attack allowed India to build a solid partnership, giving them hope of batting for a draw on the final day.</p>

          <p>CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig expressed disbelief over President Trump's response when asked if he would consider pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein. Trump stated it was something he "had not thought about," a reply Honig called an answer to "the easiest question in human history." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. While Honig finds a pardon hard to imagine, he noted that others closer to Trump believe it could happen, as the president faces increasing pressure over his past friendship with Epstein.</p>

In a short video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, deftly avoided the scandal and instead focused on the company's data workflow automation services. The move appears to be a lighthearted attempt by the company to steer the narrative back to its business following the embarrassing episode.</p>
