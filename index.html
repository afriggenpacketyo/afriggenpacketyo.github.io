However, initial gains were tempered by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff authority, which faces a Supreme Court challenge. Goldman Sachs' President John Waldron indicated a slowdown in investment banking activity for the second quarter due to market volatility, but highlighted robust equity trading and a pickup in capital markets activity. Wells Fargo also announced the termination of a 2015 consent order, marking progress in resolving regulatory issues, while Bristol Myers Squibb defended its schizophrenia drug Cobenfy despite trial setbacks, awaiting further data.

          <p>Israel announced plans to establish 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including legalizing existing unauthorized outposts. This move has drawn condemnation from neighboring Jordan and Britain, with a U.K. official calling it a deliberate obstacle to Palestinian statehood. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that the decision strengthens Israel's hold on the territory and prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state. Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement group, described the announcement as the most extensive since the 1993 Oslo accords, warning that it would reshape the West Bank and further entrench the occupation, exacerbating tensions in the region.</p>

While Hamas has acknowledged receiving the proposal and is reviewing it, President Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a deal.

          <p>Student borrowers are facing credit score declines as loan repayments resume after years of government leniency, with 2.2 million delinquent borrowers experiencing drops of over 100 points. The end of the 12-month "on ramp" period has led to credit bureaus reporting missed payments, making it more difficult and costly for borrowers to secure future loans. Experts warn of long-lasting consequences, including reduced credit limits and higher interest rates, potentially exacerbating the divide between low-income and higher-income Americans. The key is to avoid becoming delinquent, as a delinquency remains on one's credit report for seven years.</p>

The suit highlights a high number of inmate fatalities in recent years and an ongoing investigation by the California Attorney General into jail conditions and excessive force allegations. The plaintiffs argue that decisions about pre-trial detention should be based on the severity of the crime and public safety risk, not income status. A similar lawsuit prompted Los Angeles County to revise its bail policies, leading to a reduction in crime rates.</p>

          <p>A Harvard graduate student expressed concerns about the uncertain atmosphere on campus as the Trump administration intensifies efforts to restrict international students. A federal judge blocked the administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, providing a temporary victory. Tensions have escalated with the announcement that officials would begin to aggressively revoke the visas of some Chinese students. International students comprise more than a quarter of Harvard's student body, and their removal would impact the university's perspectives, international influence, and reputation, according to the student.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that regardless of climate mitigation strategies, the world’s glaciers are on track to shrink significantly over hundreds of years. Even if global temperatures stabilized at current levels, glaciers would lose roughly one-third of their mass within a millennium. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could save twice as much ice compared to the current warming trajectory. The study emphasizes the importance of ambitious climate measures to preserve glacial ice and avoid the most severe losses, while acknowledging that some ice loss is already unavoidable.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County that aims to reduce the burden of environmental regulation on land development, potentially expediting infrastructure projects. The court placed new limits on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), instructing courts to be deferential to an agency’s decision to approve a project after producing an environmental impact statement. The ruling is a victory for land developers, libertarians, and advocates of an “abundance” agenda, who argue that excessive regulation hinders economic growth and innovation. The court emphasized that NEPA should not be used to stymie projects based on indirect or geographically separate impacts.</p>
