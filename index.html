          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 4% as investors processed conflicting economic data that could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. A hotter-than-expected consumer price index report for August contrasted with a significant jump in weekly jobless claims, which reached their highest level since October 2021. This mix of persistent inflation and a potentially weakening labor market complicates the monetary policy outlook. Despite the data, markets are still overwhelmingly pricing in a quarter-point interest rate cut at the Fed's next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former executive has filed a lawsuit against Verily, Alphabet's health tech subsidiary, alleging the company improperly used the health data of over 25,000 patients without authorization. The whistleblower, Ryan Sloan, claims he was fired after reporting extensive breaches of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to senior management. The lawsuit asserts that Verily's internal investigation confirmed multiple violations but the company chose to conceal them from clients like Walgreens and Delta to avoid negative publicity and protect contract negotiations. A judge has denied Verily's request to dismiss the complaint, allowing the case to proceed.</p>

          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum declared that offshore wind energy has no future in the United States under the current Trump administration, citing high costs and unreliability. Speaking at an energy conference, Burgum confirmed the administration's intent to halt the industry, which has been under pressure since President Trump barred new leases on his first day in office. The Department of Interior is now reviewing five major offshore wind projects already under construction, which Burgum claimed were approved through a "fast ideologically-driven permitting process." This policy stance signals significant headwinds for the renewable energy sector and billions in existing investments.</p>

          <p>Phoenix Mercury guard Sophie Cunningham has criticized Chicago Sky's Angel Reese for publicly demanding the team acquire better players, stating that such frustrations should be handled internally. Reese had expressed her dissatisfaction with the team's performance, leading to a half-game suspension from the Sky for comments deemed "detrimental to the team." Cunningham emphasized the importance of protecting the locker room environment, suggesting that airing grievances in the media can cause division among teammates. Reese later apologized for her remarks following a team win, as the Sky currently hold the second-worst record in the league.</p>

          <p>Analysts estimate that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be between 2.7% and 2.8%, based on the latest inflation data. This would provide a modest increase to the monthly benefits received by millions of American retirees, potentially raising the average benefit by about $54 per month. The projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% COLA implemented in 2025 but remains in line with the 20-year average. The official COLA announcement from the Social Security Administration is expected in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City police have arrested Jamel McGriff, the suspect accused of murdering an elderly couple in their Queens home before setting it on fire. Investigators allege that McGriff, who has a lengthy criminal history, spent five hours inside the home of Frank and Maureen Olton after gaining entry by asking to charge his phone. Surveillance footage captured him entering the backyard and later leaving with bags shortly before the fire was reported. The victims were found inside the burned home; Mr. Olton had been tied up and stabbed, while Mrs. Olton was severely burned. The attack appears to be a random act of violence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 2.9% year-over-year in August, marking an acceleration from July's 2.7% rate and the fastest pace since January.

Additionally, the cost of staples such as groceries and electricity has climbed, contributing to the overall inflationary pressure. While the labor market has shown signs of cooling, which typically eases wage growth, the Federal Reserve faces a difficult decision on interest rates as it balances a weakening job market against rising inflation.

Known for his provocative style and skepticism on issues like climate change and the 2020 election, Kirk mobilized a significant number of young voters for the Republican party. His death has been labeled a targeted shooting by police, prompting a nationwide manhunt and sparking a debate about political rhetoric and violence.</p>

However, an investigation by the BBC found little evidence of significant family wealth, as her father's business was liquidated and her parents live in a modest flat.

However, he identified a critical error: the fatal shot hit Kirk in the neck, suggesting the shooter was likely aiming for the head but failed to properly account for wind and bullet drop.

          <p>This article provides a timeline of the mysterious disappearance of George Smith, who went overboard from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship in 2005 while on his honeymoon. The case, which remains unsolved, involves a night of heavy drinking, a group of young men last seen with Smith, and conflicting accounts of the evening's events. Evidence includes a significant bloodstain found on a metal canopy below his balcony and differing statements from witnesses. Despite an eight-year FBI investigation and efforts by Smith's family, no one has been charged in connection with his death, leaving lingering questions about whether it was a tragic accident or foul play.</p>

          <p>This article details the career of Peter Mandelson, who has been dismissed as the UK's ambassador to the US following revelations about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A key architect of the "New Labour" movement, Mandelson's four-decade career has been marked by significant influence, strategic prowess, and multiple forced resignations from high-profile government roles. Known as the "Prince of Darkness" for his skills as a political operator, his career has been a cycle of powerful appointments followed by scandals related to his personal finances and associations. His latest downfall underscores a recurring theme of his public life, where his connections to the wealthy and powerful have been both an asset and a liability.</p>

          <p>Ireland's national broadcaster, RTÉ, has announced it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to compete, citing the "ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza." This move adds to growing pressure on the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event's organizer, from multiple countries. Slovenia has made a similar declaration, while Spain and Iceland have also expressed serious reservations about competing alongside Israel. The statements reflect a significant political division within the typically celebratory international song contest, forcing the EBU to address the geopolitical conflict's impact on the event.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban and will now permit long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in border camps to legally work in the country. This policy shift affects around 80,000 refugees, some of whom have lived in the camps since the 1980s, and comes after the U.S. cut humanitarian food aid programs. The decision is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency as a potential "regional benchmark." The new policy may also help address labor shortages in Thailand, particularly in so-called "3D" jobs that are considered dirty, difficult, or dangerous.</p>

          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey reveals that family offices, the investment firms for the ultra-wealthy, are shifting their portfolio strategies by increasing allocations to public stocks and decreasing investments in private equity. The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity fell to 21%, the largest change among all asset classes surveyed. This move towards more liquid assets comes despite concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation. The report suggests that while family offices remain committed to private markets for long-term growth, they are also positioning themselves to be more opportunistic in public markets during periods of dislocation.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing questions about his judgment following the dismissal of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. This article argues that the risks of the appointment were known, as Lord Mandelson's friendship with the convicted sex offender, which continued after his conviction, was publicly documented. Despite this, Starmer's administration proceeded, calculating that Mandelson's extensive network and political skills outweighed the potential for scandal. The eventual fallout, prompted by the release of embarrassing correspondence, has now forced the Prime Minister's hand and raised concerns about the vetting process and decision-making within his government.</p>

          <p>Liu Jun, a prominent mathematician from Harvard University, has clarified that his decision to leave the U.S. and return to China was driven by personal and family reasons, not political protest or professional dissatisfaction. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu explained that his move to Tsinghua University is rooted in a deep connection to the campus where he was born and a desire to be with family. His departure is part of a broader trend of high-profile academics of Chinese descent leaving Western institutions, a phenomenon often linked to geopolitical tensions, but Liu insists his motivations are unrelated to the political climate.</p>

The report also highlighted disparities in income growth, with the top 10% of earners seeing a 4.2% increase, while the bottom 10% saw only a 2.2% rise. Additionally, the gender wage gap among full-time workers widened for the second consecutive year. (not investment advice)</p>
