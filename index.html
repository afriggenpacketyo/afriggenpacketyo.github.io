          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled against the government's request to force Google to sell its Chrome browser as part of a major antitrust case. While allowing Google to retain Chrome, the judge mandated that the tech giant must share some of its valuable search engine data with competitors to curb its monopolistic power. This decision follows a finding that Google illegally maintained its dominance in online search through exclusive default-engine agreements, and it aims to foster more competition in a market increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a prominent aircraft leasing company, has agreed to a $7.4 billion deal to be taken private by an investor group including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects ongoing consolidation within the airplane-renting industry, which owns over half the world's passenger jets. This move comes as the sector grapples with record rental rates driven by aircraft shortages and supply chain issues, while some airlines reconsider capacity amid fluctuating demand.

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have publicly condemned Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in an open letter. They accuse him of endangering American health by restricting vaccine access, cutting research funding, and undermining the agency's mission, citing the recent removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez as a critical issue. Kennedy has defended his actions, stating the CDC had lost public trust due to "politicized science" and needed reform to address its core functions effectively.</p>

Lowell, known for representing high-profile clients across the political spectrum like Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner, is challenging what he calls executive overreach by the Trump administration. His strategy involves suing the administration over the firing, arguing the allegations against Cook are unsubstantiated and do not meet the legal threshold for removal "for cause," positioning him at the forefront of a major fight over regulatory independence.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy in Houston was fatally shot while playing a "ding-dong ditch" prank with his cousin. Police allege that the suspect, 42-year-old Gonzalo Leon Jr., was "waiting in the shadows" and followed the boys before opening fire as they ran away. The victim, Julian Guzman, was recording the prank on his phone, which captured the sound of the gunshots. Leon, a former Army veteran, has been charged with murder, and a search of his home uncovered numerous firearms and tactical gear.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration will ask the Supreme Court for an "expedited ruling" to overturn a federal appeals court decision that deemed most of his international tariffs illegal. The appeals court found that the president lacked the authority to impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, arguing that such power rests exclusively with Congress. Trump contended that the tariffs are essential for the nation's "financial fabric" and claimed the stock market's downturn was a direct result of the adverse court ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, the maker of Modelo and Corona beer, has significantly slashed its full-year financial guidance, citing a challenging macroeconomic environment that is weakening consumer demand. The company's stock fell after it lowered its earnings per share outlook and projected a 2% to 4% drop in net beer sales, reversing previous expectations of growth. The CEO pointed to a notable decline in purchasing from Hispanic consumers, a key demographic, which the company attributes to concerns over immigration policies and potential job losses.

          <p>A UK council's attempt to stop a hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers has been dealt a legal setback, as the Court of Appeal has denied its request to take the case to the Supreme Court. Epping Forest District Council had initially won a temporary injunction to remove migrants from The Bell Hotel, arguing a breach of planning rules, but that was overturned. The council can still apply directly to the Supreme Court, but in the meantime, its leader has called for protesters to de-escalate demonstrations amid community strain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the prevalent narrative of rampant violence, and President Trump's recent description of Chicago as a "killing field," the city has experienced a dramatic drop in violent crime this year. Robberies have reportedly fallen by a third compared to the previous year, and the city is on pace to record its lowest murder rate in over a decade. While violence remains concentrated in specific neighborhoods, the overall trend shows a significant improvement, challenging the perception often highlighted in national political discourse.</p>

One of these million-dollar winning tickets was sold at a 76 gas station in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles.

          <p>Over the Labor Day weekend, Chicago recorded 37 separate shooting incidents that resulted in eight deaths and 50 injuries, according to police data. This violence occurred amid heightened national attention, as the Trump administration has threatened to deploy federal agents or National Guard troops to the city to address crime. In response to the threats, Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to prevent city departments from collaborating with what he termed "federal overreach," highlighting the political tensions surrounding the city's public safety issues.</p>

          <p>England's one-day international cricket team, under new captain Harry Brook, suffered a comprehensive defeat against South Africa at Headingley. England's batters collapsed, losing seven wickets for just 21 runs to be bowled out for a meager 131, a total South Africa easily surpassed. The lopsided loss serves as a reality check for the team at the start of Brook's captaincy and raises questions about the players' preparation and fatigue amid a demanding schedule, continuing a trend of poor performances in the 50-over format.</p>
