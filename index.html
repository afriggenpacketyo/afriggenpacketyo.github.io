          <p>Deliberations in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs will continue after the jury announced it was deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering, which carries a potential life sentence. The twelve-member panel informed the judge they had reached a unanimous decision on four of the five counts, though those verdicts have not been revealed. Following arguments from both sides, Judge Arun Subramanian urged the jurors to persist in their efforts to reach a consensus on the final charge. The trial has spanned two months, featuring testimony from 34 witnesses including former employees and federal agents.</p>

This strategic shift, championed by leader William Lai Ching-te, reflects growing concerns in Taipei about a potential prolonged conflict with Beijing.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government was forced into a significant policy reversal on welfare reform after facing a large-scale rebellion from within his own Labour Party. The government abandoned its plan to change eligibility criteria for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) following intense pressure and the threat of a parliamentary defeat. This climbdown has been described as a humiliating moment for the new prime minister, creating turmoil within the party and leading to questions about his control and leadership. The episode has also fueled speculation about inevitable tax rises in the upcoming autumn budget.</p>

President Trump toured the remote site, which can hold 5,000 migrants, highlighting its treacherous swamp surroundings as a natural deterrent to escape.

          <p>President Donald Trump, accompanied by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Governor Ron DeSantis, toured a new migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades. The facility, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is located on an isolated airstrip and is designed to deter illegal immigration with its remote, swampy surroundings. Trump praised its rapid construction and noted that the alligators and treacherous terrain serve as natural security, stating the only way out is deportation. The center can currently hold 3,000 people and may serve as a model for similar facilities as the administration ramps up deportations.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 7% ahead of its second-quarter delivery report, a drop linked to a renewed public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The feud ignited over Trump's signature spending bill, which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt and cutting renewable energy support, potentially harming Tesla's sales. In response, Trump alluded to the significant government subsidies and contracts that Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, rely on. This political clash adds to investor uncertainty as Wall Street anticipates a 13% year-over-year decline in Tesla's vehicle deliveries. (not investment advice)</p>

The 940-page bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, expands the child tax credit, and allocates significant funding for defense and border security, including the wall. However, it also proposes major cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid and has drawn criticism, including from Elon Musk, for potentially adding trillions to the national debt.

Brennan stated the move is necessary to fairly handle the claims while allowing the diocese to continue its ministry. However, attorneys representing the abuse survivors have criticized the filing as a delay tactic to evade accountability and justice for their clients. The bankruptcy proceedings will establish a court-managed fund for the survivors, but critics argue it shifts the focus from the victims' stories to corporate finances.</p>

          <p>A massive spending bill approved by the Senate includes potential cuts of $930 billion to Medicaid over the next decade, raising alarms for the millions of nursing home residents who rely on the program. In states like West Virginia, over three-quarters of nursing home residents depend on Medicaid, and facility administrators worry the cuts could impact everything from staffing to food and utilities. A Republican state senator from West Virginia, whose grandmother is a resident, expressed concern, stating that the budget should not be balanced on the backs of the elderly. The bill now returns to the House for further negotiation and a final vote.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology using powerful, specialized magnets is transforming battlefield medicine in Ukraine by enabling surgeons to safely and quickly remove shrapnel from complex wounds. With shrapnel injuries from drone warfare now accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma, these magnetic extractors allow for minimally invasive procedures, even on delicate organs like the heart. Developed by a volunteer team in response to needs from front-line medics, the devices have been used in thousands of successful operations. This innovation is considered a game-changer for treating fragmentation wounds, which are notoriously difficult and time-consuming to address.</p>

The agreement stems from a civil rights investigation related to swimmer Lia Thomas and requires the university to adopt "biology-based definitions" of male and female. UPenn will also apologize to female athletes who were competitively disadvantaged and update its records, though it did not specify if Thomas's records would be erased.

This change eliminates a tool that both community advocates and project opponents have used to delay or block development through lengthy studies and lawsuits.

          <p>Warner Music Group has announced a major restructuring plan aimed at cutting annual costs by $300 million to "future-proof" the company. In a memo to staff, CEO Robert Kyncl stated that $170 million of these savings will come from "headcount rightsizing," though the specific number of layoffs was not disclosed. This follows previous rounds of job cuts over the past two years as the company transforms its operations. Kyncl emphasized that the restructuring will allow for increased investment in artist development and acquisitions, including a new $1.2 billion joint venture with Bain Capital to purchase music catalogs.</p>

          <h2>Environmental Organizations Denounce California's Overhaul of CEQA Law</h2>

          <p>Environmental groups have expressed outrage over Governor Gavin Newsom signing legislation that significantly reforms the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Critics, including a coalition of over 100 organizations, called the move an unprecedented rollback of fundamental environmental protections, designed to speed up housing and infrastructure projects. The new laws exempt most urban infill housing and other projects from CEQA's rigorous review process. Opponents are concerned this will harm vulnerable communities and ecosystems by allowing industrial development without sufficient oversight, and they are now calling for follow-up legislation to address these issues.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Revoking Citizenship of NYC Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of stripping New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani of his U.S. citizenship. The move follows a call from a Republican congressman to investigate whether Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, concealed support for terrorism during his naturalization process. The White House press secretary indicated that if the claims are true, an investigation is warranted, aligning with a broader administration push to denaturalize citizens convicted of certain offenses. Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, called the threat an authoritarian attack on democracy and free speech.</p>
