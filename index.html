          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Colorado, Denver, and their leaders, including Governor Jared Polis and Mayor Mike Johnston, challenging state and city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit argues that these sanctuary policies, which restrict information sharing and prohibit holding individuals solely on civil immigration detainers, are unconstitutional and create a safe haven for criminals. While Colorado officials maintain they are not a sanctuary state and already cooperate with federal authorities, the administration claims these policies hinder deportation efforts and endanger residents. This legal action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to compel state and local law enforcement to assist with federal immigration enforcement plans.</p>

          <p>Greg Abel, Warren Buffett's long-time lieutenant and energy executive, has been designated as the successor to the CEO role at Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett made the announcement at the annual shareholders meeting, stating that he believes the time has arrived for Abel to take over. Abel currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies and is known for rebuilding MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a major producer of wind energy. While Abel is considered more hands-on than Buffett, he is well-regarded by Berkshire's managers and praised for his business acumen, though he will face the challenge of matching Buffett's legendary performance.</p>

          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have resigned following a controversial plea deal offered to a sheriff's deputy, Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of using excessive force against a woman. The new U.S. Attorney, Bill Essayli, appointed by President Trump, offered Kirk a misdemeanor plea after he had already been found guilty of a felony, a move considered highly unorthodox. The prosecutors who resigned, including the chief of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section, withdrew from the case in protest, citing concerns about the integrity of the legal process and the undermining of a jury verdict. The incident has sparked outrage and raised questions about political interference in the justice system.</p>

          <p>A police training expert testified in the trial of three former Memphis officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, acknowledging that kicks and punches to Nichols’ head were unnecessary and excessive. The expert, called as a defense witness, stated that while some initial force was justified, the blows to Nichols' head constituted deadly force and should have been stopped by other officers. The officers are charged with second-degree murder and other offenses in connection with Nichols' death, which sparked nationwide protests and calls for police reform. The trial has focused on whether the officers used excessive force and whether they failed to intervene to stop the beating.</p>

          <p>As official research positions are lost due to budget cuts, the efforts of citizen scientists to preserve federal forests are becoming increasingly valuable. Volunteers like Don Pike, Arizona's Weed Manager of the Year, are clearing invasive species and monitoring threatened cactuses in the Tonto National Forest. With the Trump administration's cuts to the U.S. Forest Service, these volunteers play a vital role in reducing fire risks and capturing data on threatened species. Patti Fenner, a former Forest Service employee, founded Friends of the Tonto to engage volunteers in maintaining the ecological balance of the forest.</p>
