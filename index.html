          <p>Jonathan Joss, known for voicing John Redcorn on "King of the Hill," was fatally shot in San Antonio, Texas, at the age of 55 after a longstanding neighborhood feud with Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, who has been charged with murder. Police responded to a shooting in progress and found Joss dead at the scene. Neighbors reported frequent arguments and confrontations between the two men, with Joss often armed with a crossbow. Joss was slated to reprise his role in the upcoming "King of the Hill" revival on Hulu and also appeared in other shows such as "Parks and Recreation," "Tulsa King," and "True Grit." The optimism score is appropriately low considering the tragic nature of the events.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are debating President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to concerns about its impact on the national debt, which stands at nearly $37 trillion. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by over $1.5 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates it would add about $3.1 trillion to the debt, a figure some Republicans dispute. Fiscal hawks like Senators Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are pushing for deeper cuts, potentially complicating the bill's passage in the Senate, where Republicans have limited defections they can afford; meanwhile, Trump has criticized those who oppose the bill. The article discusses the complexities of passing the bill, including the need for House approval of any Senate changes and the potential for entitlement program cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Freedom Caucus is urging for an immediate House vote on the White House's $9.4 billion spending cut proposal, targeting funding for NPR, PBS, and USAID. Led by Chairman Andy Harris, the caucus emphasizes the importance of swiftly passing the rescissions package to demonstrate commitment to the Trump agenda and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This comes as Elon Musk concludes his leadership of President Trumpâ€™s DOGE effort, with the White House expected to send the spending cuts package to Congress on Tuesday.

          <p>Recent attacks targeting the Jewish community in Boulder, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., are being investigated as hate crimes, revealing a disturbing trend of performative anti-Semitism. In Boulder, a suspect used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails at a gathering supporting the release of Israeli hostages, while in D.C., an attacker shot and killed two Israeli embassy staff. The article emphasizes that these attacks are specifically directed at Jewish people, intending to inflict horror on the community and falsely assigning blame for Israeli policies to Jews worldwide. The author argues for the need to delegitimize such acts without qualification, maintaining a clear distinction between Israeli actions and Jewish identity.</p>

          <p>A federal jury's conviction of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy for using excessive force was undermined after a new U.S. Attorney, Bill Essayli, took office.

This decision prompted resignations from federal prosecutors and raised concerns about the independence of the Justice Department.

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about the GOP's proposed bill, which is expected to increase the deficit at a time when the economy is relatively stable. The article explains that large deficits are already making bond investors nervous, potentially making it harder to respond to future economic crises. The economists' analysis suggests the bill could have negative long-term consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine executed a daring "Spider Web" attack on June 1, striking air bases deep inside Russia with over 100 drones, targeting nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The drones were smuggled into Russia in wooden cabins on lorries, launched near airbases, and guided by pilots, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine claims to have hit 41 strategic bombers and destroyed at least 13, while Russia acknowledges only some damage. The operation, which took 18 months to prepare, cost Russia an estimated $7 billion and targeted military airfields and aircraft used to bomb Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>The UK government is investing billions to prepare for potential war, given new threats from nuclear powers like Russia and China. The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) calls for building 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, six new munitions factories, and embracing technologies like artificial intelligence. The defense secretary stated that the British army needs to become "10 times more lethal" to face the new threats, although Conservative shadow defense secretary called the plans "underfunded and totally underwhelming". The SDR warns of inadequate stockpiles of weapons, poor recruitment, and crumbling morale in the UK's armed forces.</p>

          <p>The article suggests that opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June could be a wise financial move due to potential interest rate cuts, protection against market volatility, and the opportunity to earn substantial interest. With Federal Reserve rate cuts potentially imminent, locking in current rates can be advantageous. A long-term CD provides a fixed interest rate, shielding savings from market fluctuations and ensuring predictable returns.
