            <p>A Russian ballistic missile struck the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Palm Sunday, resulting in the deaths of at least 21 people and injuring 20 more, according to local officials. The strike targeted multiple buildings, including residential ones, and was condemned by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called for a strong international response. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for increased pressure on Russia to end the war and described the attack as an act of terror against ordinary civilians, occurring on a religious holiday. The attack highlights the ongoing conflict and its devastating impact on Ukrainian communities.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set for a retrial after an appellate court found that the initial judge made procedural errors. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that Palin argued falsely linked her to a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona. The retrial will re-examine whether the Times acted with actual malice, a high legal bar for public figures to prove defamation. The outcome could have implications for press freedoms, particularly regarding the standard for proving defamation in cases involving public figures.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, requiring proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, is raising concerns about potential disenfranchisement of married women who have changed their last names. Legal experts suggest that the SAVE Act could disproportionately affect these women, as their birth certificates may not match their current legal names. While states could accept marriage certificates or legal name change decrees, obtaining these documents could pose an additional burden. Concerns also exist that the bill's ambiguity could lead to inconsistent enforcement across different states.</p>

            <p>President Trump's attacks on law firms representing causes he opposes are creating a climate of fear, potentially deterring them from taking on politically sensitive pro bono cases, according to civil rights advocates. Some firms have reportedly declined to assist organizations challenging government policies, citing concerns about political ramifications. This pullback could reduce the number of challenges to potentially unconstitutional government actions, impacting the legal system's ability to function properly. Some law firms are fighting back legally, arguing that the executive orders' punitive measures are unlawful.</p>

            <p>This article discusses three dividend stocks to consider in April: Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), UDR, and W.P. Carey (WPC). TD Bank is a low-risk turnaround play with a 5.1% yield, despite past issues with money laundering in the US. UDR is a REIT focused on apartments with a 4.2% yield and a diversified portfolio. WPC is a net lease REIT with a 6% yield, poised for growth after a strategic exit from office properties. The article advises sticking to reliable, high-yield stocks during market downturns.

            <p>Sarah Manavis discusses how the trend of prioritizing intense work, such as extreme surveillance and inflexible, harsh practices, has made a comeback. However, Gen Z is fighting back and rejecting work that looks anything close to gruelling. They are ready to pledge their loyalty to their employers, but only to those companies willing to fulfill the reasonable expectation that employees get something substantial and equally committed in return. This philosophy has no winners.</p>

            <p>Eva Wiseman discusses the comeback of heels and what they mean today, as the politics of heels span gender, wealth, identity and power, reappearing like migraines at moments of political unrest. Stella McCartney is quoted as talking about the end of the world and that she is flipping it by dressing like she’s going to battle. For the author, the benefits of wearing heels is that it’s a constant reminder that I have a body. A reminder, too, to sit up, to think about how to get to where I’m going, to pay attention.</p>

            <p>Scientists at King's College London have successfully grown a human tooth under laboratory conditions, marking a significant step forward in regenerative dentistry. By introducing a special material that facilitates cell communication, researchers have been able to mimic the natural process of tooth development. This breakthrough could lead to biologically compatible solutions for tooth replacement that are stronger and longer-lasting than fillings or implants, though practical application is still years away.</p>
