          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, following a national security assessment. The move is justified by copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other key industries, aiming to bolster domestic production. The announcement caused a significant spike in U.S. copper prices, with experts warning of potential shortages and increased costs for consumers and industries reliant on the metal, which the U.S. heavily imports.

          <p>Russian forces launched another large-scale overnight drone attack on Kyiv, injuring at least 13 people and causing fires in multiple districts. Ukraine's military administration reported that wreckage from downed drones struck residential buildings and other structures, prompting air raid alerts across the city. This assault follows what was described as the largest-ever aerial attack from Russia just the previous night, continuing a pattern of intense strikes on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch is calling for new welfare curbs that would prevent foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits. In an upcoming speech, she will characterize Britain's rising benefits bill as a major economic threat, aiming to create a clear policy distinction with the Labour party. The proposal comes as the government has already scaled back other planned welfare cuts, and it seeks to limit access to benefits like Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to British citizens, with some exceptions.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its key interest rate steady at 2.5% as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures designed to cool down Seoul's overheating housing market. Authorities are concerned about a significant acceleration in housing prices and a rapid expansion of household debt, prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth stimulation. While the economy has shown signs of contraction, analysts expect the central bank may consider rate cuts later in the year once the housing market stabilizes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam, the four wealthiest individuals in Africa possess more wealth than the bottom 50% of the continent's population combined. The continent's 23 billionaires have seen their collective wealth increase by 56% over the last five years, reaching $112.6 billion. The report argues that government policies are often biased against the poor, allowing the super-rich to accumulate more wealth and exacerbating inequality that hinders poverty reduction and democratic processes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 positions at NASA, targeting high-ranking employees with specialized skills and management experience. According to documents, the cuts are part of a broader government-wide push to reduce the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. This move has caused chaos within the space agency, with former NASA leaders warning that the proposed cuts threaten key science programs and could cede U.S. leadership in space exploration to competitors like China.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest number of infections in 33 years and surpassing the total for all of 2019. Health officials attribute the resurgence of the nearly-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates in some communities. The largest portion of this year's cases is linked to a significant outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in the deaths of two children and has spread across 38 states, prompting renewed calls for MMR vaccination.</p>

The decision allows the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to reduce the size of the federal government while legal challenges from labor unions proceed. The court's majority argued the administration was likely to succeed on the merits, while dissenting justices criticized the move as greenlighting legally dubious presidential actions.</p>
