          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband and 50 other men who sexually assaulted her over a decade. Her case prompted a national conversation on sexual violence and led to legal reforms, including a bill that incorporates a lack of consent into the criminal definition of sexual assault in France. Pelicot's advocacy has been widely praised for encouraging other survivors to speak out.</p>

          <p>Singapore narrowly avoided a technical recession with 1.4% GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025, driven primarily by its manufacturing sector. Despite this positive turn from the previous quarter's contraction, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year. The government cited unclear U.S. tariff policies as a major concern, even as it rolls out grants to help businesses manage global trade tensions. This economic data precedes an upcoming monetary policy decision by the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Signals Readiness for Further Interest Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 22:16:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market weakens. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. This follows two previous rate cuts this year, with the current rate at 4.25%, and comes amid recent economic data showing the UK economy contracted in May. The governor's comments suggest a proactive stance to stimulate the economy amid slowing growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Colorado's 18th Judicial District intend to dismiss charges against a registered sex offender accused of attempting to kidnap an 11-year-old boy from an elementary school. The decision follows a mental competency evaluation that found the suspect, Solomon Galligan, unfit to stand trial, leaving the prosecutor's office with no legal alternative but to drop the case. The incident, captured on video, caused significant alarm in the community and led to administrative changes at the school, including the replacement of the principal. The school district has since implemented enhanced security protocols.</p>

The article highlights the potential impact on rural communities, where local public media stations often serve as the primary or sole source of news and critical safety information. For many of these stations, federal grants constitute a significant portion of their budget, and their closure could create or expand "news deserts."

          <p>A volatile wildfire in Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire also burned a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that complicated firefighting efforts. In a separate climate-related event, smoke from widespread Canadian wildfires is drifting across the border, causing unhealthy air quality alerts throughout the U.S. Upper Midwest. These incidents highlight a period of extreme environmental challenges, with dangerous heat, fires, and poor air quality affecting large parts of North America.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of the baseball season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory over the San Francisco Giants, securing a 5.5-game lead in the NL West. Despite holding the best record in the National League, the team's performance has been inconsistent, marked by both a high-scoring offense and struggles from an injury-plagued pitching staff. Stars like Yoshinobu Yamamoto have been brilliant, while the bullpen has been a source of concern. The team has managed to grind out wins and maintain its top position, but acknowledges the need for improvement in the second half.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a "notably different" climate compared to just a few decades ago, with extreme heat and rainfall events becoming more frequent, according to a new Met Office report. The "State of the UK Climate" assessment shows the country is warming at a rate of 0.25°C per decade, leading to more very hot days and fewer cold nights. The report highlights that 2024 saw numerous heat and rainfall records broken, a trend that is continuing in 2025. This long-term shift is impacting the natural world and increasing risks like flooding from rising sea levels.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some conservative leaders abroad, is facing a growing political challenge at home. While his Fidesz party has long dominated, a new opposition figure, Peter Magyar, has emerged from Orban's own circle, capitalizing on public discontent over corruption and the declining state of public services. Magyar's Tisza party is now polling competitively with Fidesz. This article analyzes how Orban's long-successful strategy of targeting cultural issues may be weakening as economic stagnation and governance failures become more prominent concerns for Hungarian voters.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is escalating a long-running water dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to the U.S., but is currently in arrears due to critically low reservoir levels in states like Chihuahua. Texan farmers, who are also suffering from water shortages, are pressuring the U.S. government to enforce the treaty, with President Trump threatening tariffs. The conflict highlights the growing strain that climate change and resource scarcity are placing on international agreements and regional stability.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump will make a second official state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17-19, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. This is an unprecedented honor, as second-term U.S. presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The trip is viewed as a significant act of soft diplomacy by the British government to maintain strong ties with the Trump administration. The visit will include a full ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, though it is unlikely to feature a public procession or an address to the House of Commons, which will be in recess.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended its new 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a larger strategy to onshore production and reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which it defines as a national security risk. When questioned about the fact that the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett argued for the necessity of an overall global strategy to prevent transshipping. The move has been criticized for potentially harming U.S. firms that rely on imports like copper, a key component in manufacturing and defense systems. (not investment advice)</p>

The shortened performance and fewer special guests contrasted sharply with his longer, guest-filled shows on the previous two nights. The abrupt ending led to discontent among the crowd, with some fans noting they had spent more time queuing than watching the headline act perform.</p>
