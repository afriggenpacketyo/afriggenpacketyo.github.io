The article notes this is part of a broader GOP effort to expand its House majority, with similar redistricting pushes occurring in Texas and California. Democratic opponents, including Rep.

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield and Governor Tina Kotek argue that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the Guard, asserting that Portland is not 'war ravaged' and local officials can manage public safety. The article highlights the state's contention that the deployment is an unlawful political maneuver, not a response to a genuine threat, and could incite further public outcry.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. This measure aims to control the overwhelming tourist numbers, which reached 2.6 million last year for a resident population of just 100. The article highlights residents' complaints about a lack of privacy due to tourists entering gardens and houses. While local shop and restaurant owners fear a loss of business, the fee will include museum and windmill access, with revenues intended for maintenance and new infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The rising popularity and cost of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are turning obesity into a wealth issue, with thousands of NHS patients reportedly missing out due to tight access restrictions. While these drugs offer significant weight loss, their high private cost (up to £350 a month) creates a two-tier system, disproportionately benefiting the affluent. The article highlights concerns from health experts about a 'postcode lottery' for NHS prescriptions and potential worsening of existing health inequalities, especially as pharmaceutical companies plan price increases.
