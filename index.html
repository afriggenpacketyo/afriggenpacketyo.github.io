          <h2>Trump Proposes Shift from Quarterly to Semiannual Corporate Earnings Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:02:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports to encourage long-term strategic thinking. This idea, which would require SEC approval, echoes previous proposals by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon who argued the current system fosters an unhealthy focus on short-term profits. Supporters of the quarterly system maintain that it provides essential transparency and timely information for investors, arguing that less frequent reporting could create more difficulties than benefits in the U.S. market. The proposal contrasts with current U.S. regulations but aligns more closely with practices in the U.K. and European Union.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reportedly established a framework for a deal concerning the ownership of TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The announcement followed negotiations in Spain and was teased by President Trump, who stated a deal was reached to save a company popular with young people. President Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday to finalize the agreement, which is described as being between two private parties with commercial terms already settled. This development comes after Trump delayed enforcement of a congressional bill that would have banned the app unless its parent company, ByteDance, divested.</p>

          <p>The FBI has revealed that the suspect arrested in the fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, had an apparent obsession with him. Investigators are examining Robinson's digital footprint and online chats to determine if others were aware of his intentions, while DNA evidence from the crime scene has also linked him to the killing. The suspect's father reportedly recognized him from photos released by authorities and played a role in his apprehension. President Trump has called for the death penalty for the alleged shooter, a sentiment echoed by Utah's governor.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Hamas leaders will not have immunity "wherever they are," refusing to rule out further strikes following the recent controversial attack in Qatar. During a press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu emphasized a country's right to self-defense beyond its borders, asserting that Israel conducted the strike on its own. The attack drew international condemnation, including from President Trump, and created tension with Qatar, a key U.S. ally. Despite the friction, Rubio and Netanyahu presented a united front, highlighting the strong ties between their two nations.</p>

          <p>A violent attack on a pool hall in Santo Domingo, Ecuador, has left seven people dead and four injured, marking the second such massacre in the city in under a month. Police attribute the shooting to a "territorial dispute" between organized crime groups, a recurring issue in the country which serves as a hub for drug trafficking and gang-related violence. This incident is part of a recent wave of similar attacks in Ecuador, which has seen a significant increase in its homicide rate.

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized New York Governor Kathy Hochul for endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, whom Trump has labeled a "Liddle Communist." In a social media post, Trump called the endorsement a "shocking development" and suggested that federal funding for the city could be at risk if Mamdani is elected. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has proposed policies such as fare-free buses and tuition-free public university, while denying he is a communist. Hochul's endorsement is seen as a significant move to unify the Democratic party behind Mamdani, who leads polls against other candidates.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated he would "never" have appointed Peter Mandelson as his U.S. ambassador had he been aware of the full extent of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer's comments follow his decision to sack Lord Mandelson after emails from 2008 reportedly showed Mandelson sending supportive messages to Epstein after his guilty plea. The Prime Minister acknowledged that while Mandelson passed a due diligence process, the new information would have prevented the appointment. The swift reversal occurred just one day after Starmer had publicly backed Lord Mandelson during Prime Minister's Questions.</p>

This move comes as Tesla's stock has faced challenges this year due to slowing sales and as shareholders prepare to vote on a new, potentially massive compensation package for Musk.

          <h2>Borrowers Advised on Steps to Take When Student Loan Servicer Changes Unexpectedly</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising student loan borrowers on how to navigate unexpected transfers of their loans to new servicing companies, a process that can cause confusion and concern. Borrowers may discover the change with little notice and find their accounts placed in administrative forbearance, pausing payments but potentially accruing interest. To avoid payments getting lost during the transition, it is recommended to set aside the payment amount and wait until the new account is fully active before submitting it. It is also crucial for borrowers to download their payment history from the old servicer and verify that all information, including payment plans, has been transferred correctly.</p>

          <p>Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK, stating that the Conservative Party is "over" as a national political force. Kruger, who served as a shadow minister on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team, made the announcement alongside Reform leader Nigel Farage, expressing his hope that Farage would become the next prime minister. He criticized his former party for a record of "failure," citing bigger government and higher taxes. The defection is a significant blow to Badenoch's leadership, as Kruger is a prominent conservative thinker, further highlighting the growing challenge from Reform UK.</p>

          <p>The watermelon has become a potent symbol of Palestinian identity and protest, largely due to its colors mirroring the Palestinian flag: red, green, black, and white. Its use as a political statement originated in the 1980s after Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in the occupied territories, with an Israeli officer reportedly suggesting even a painted watermelon would be confiscated. This act of defiance has been revived today, especially on social media, where the watermelon emoji is used to bypass censorship and show solidarity. The symbol's history highlights a long-standing struggle over national identity and expression in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Financial expert Suze Orman asserts that a retirement plan is not secure until several key financial and legal steps are completed, regardless of the total net worth. She emphasizes that the number one priority must be eliminating all housing debt, including paying off one's mortgage completely before retiring. Additionally, Orman stresses the necessity of having proper legal protections in place, such as a will and a trust. Finally, she highlights the critical importance of securing both long-term care insurance to cover potentially devastating healthcare costs and maintaining adequate life insurance to protect one's family and assets.

          <p>A recent survey by Natixis Investment Managers reveals that 21% of Americans feel it will take a miracle for them to retire securely, highlighting widespread anxiety about financial futures.

They advise individuals to start saving early, remain consistent, and create a detailed retirement strategy that honestly assesses future costs and lifestyle goals, often with the help of a financial advisor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Job seekers are increasingly using AI tools for applications, but career experts warn against over-reliance, which can lead to significant errors and harm one's chances. A common issue is AI "hallucinating" or fabricating information to better match a job description, creating inaccuracies that candidates cannot defend in an interview. Additionally, AI-generated resumes and cover letters often lack authenticity and share a uniform structure, making them less likely to stand out to recruiters. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial creation, and always proofreading carefully to avoid embarrassing mistakes like including AI prompts or incorrect company names.</p>

          <p>Documents reveal that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described a condominium she purchased as a "vacation home" on a loan estimate, a detail that could undermine the Trump administration's mortgage fraud allegations against her. President Trump has sought to fire Cook, claiming she improperly declared two properties as primary residences simultaneously to secure better loan terms. However, the "vacation home" and "second home" classifications on different forms, along with tax records showing no homestead exemption was claimed, may counter the administration's case. Cook has obtained a court injunction to block her firing as the legal battle continues.</p>

They contend that if the administration genuinely wanted to help, it would invest in community-based support services, focus on improving crime clearance rates, and address gun trafficking.

Hall is positioning himself as an experienced leader who will focus on accountability, contrasting with Mejia, whom he accuses of prioritizing "social media theatrics." The race sets up a classic confrontation between an establishment Democrat, backed by prominent officials, and the city's ascendant left, represented by Mejia, who won in 2022 as a political outsider. The election will test whether voter sentiment has shifted since the last cycle, which was marked by deep distrust in City Hall.</p>

Burrow sustained the injury during Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars when he was sacked. This is another significant injury for the 28-year-old quarterback, who has struggled with staying healthy throughout his career since being drafted first overall in 2020. The loss of Burrow, who led the team to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021, is a devastating blow to the Bengals' aspirations for the current season.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man, Ryder Corral, has been arrested in Phoenix, Arizona, for allegedly vandalizing a memorial dedicated to conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The memorial was established outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA following Kirk's assassination in Utah four days prior. Witnesses reported seeing a man damaging the display of flowers and mementos before being subdued by a bystander and arrested by nearby police. Corral now faces charges of criminal damage and disorderly conduct. The incident adds to the tensions following Kirk's killing, for which a 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, was arrested after a two-day manhunt.</p>
