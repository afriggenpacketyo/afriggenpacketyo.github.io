          <h2>South African Government Report Finds Fatal Building Collapse Was Preventable</h2>

          <p>A government report on a building collapse in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers, has concluded the tragedy was "entirely preventable." Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that multiple failures, including substandard materials and unaddressed structural cracks, were known for up to a year before the incident. The report details how workers' concerns about vibrations were ignored and problems were actively covered up, leading to calls for criminal accountability for the negligence. The investigation is ongoing, while survivors and victims' families continue to face significant hardship.</p>

          <p>A vehicle rammed into a crowd waiting outside a nightclub in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, injuring 30 people, with at least seven in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning, striking people lined up to enter the venue as well as a nearby taco truck and valet stand. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly attacked the driver, who was discovered to have been shot; a suspect who shot the driver remains at large. Authorities have launched a full investigation into the "heartbreaking tragedy," with a massive emergency response attending to the chaotic scene.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever player Kelsey Mitchell addressed the fan treatment of Chicago Sky's Angel Reese, urging for a focus on "human to human" decency rather than race. Speaking at the WNBA All-Star game, Mitchell expressed that negative comments are disrespectful to the athletes and hoped fans would see the players as human beings. The discussion stems from the polarizing attention on Reese, particularly her rivalry with Caitlin Clark, which has driven league popularity but also incited online criticism. A prior WNBA investigation into alleged hateful comments from fans towards Reese was not substantiated.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially anticipated. Muncy, who was injured in early July, has already resumed baseball activities like running and swinging, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting a return much sooner than the original six-week timeline. The Dodgers' offense has struggled significantly in his absence, highlighting his importance to the team's lineup. Muncy expressed relief that the injury was not more severe, noting that a slight difference in timing could have resulted in season-ending surgery.</p>

The athletes—Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton—received a warm reception from the crowd.

          <p>Economists are evaluating the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which have been in place for over 100 days. Analysts note the tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and prompted some companies to announce new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, they also caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs are beginning to increase consumer prices, risking inflation. Despite initial fears, the broader economy has remained resilient, but the recent announcement of new, widespread tariffs adds a fresh layer of uncertainty to the long-term outlook.

          <h2>Congressional Approval of Spending Rescissions Signals Potential Shift in Budgeting Process</h2>

          <p>Congress has approved President Trump's request to claw back $9 billion in previously allocated federal funds, a move that analysts see as a significant test case for future budgeting. The rescission, which targets programs like foreign aid and public broadcasting, passed with a simple majority in the Senate, bypassing the usual 60-vote requirement for appropriations bills. Observers suggest this could signal a shift towards a more partisan budgeting process, potentially altering how the federal government has been funded for years. This approach allows the controlling party to enact spending cuts without needing bipartisan support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility on Long Island, New York. According to police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against staff orders while his relative was undergoing a scan. The machine's powerful magnet pulled the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing fatal injuries. The incident highlights the strict safety protocols surrounding MRI machines, which can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles due to their immense magnetic force.</p>

The GHF denied any incidents occurred at its sites, while the Israeli military stated troops fired warning shots at "suspects" who approached them before the sites opened. This event adds to daily reports of Palestinians being killed while seeking food, with the UN recently noting over 600 such deaths near GHF sites.</p>

It points to rising measles cases and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to stop recommending Covid-19 boosters for certain groups against the advice of medical experts. The author highlights new surveys showing a majority of pregnant women and parents of young children do not intend to fully vaccinate their kids. This trend is presented as a dangerous reversal of medical progress, fueled by anti-vaccine sentiment within the government.</p>

Instead of chasing a specific number, experts advise focusing on aligning spending with personal values and ensuring money management supports life goals, which is key to achieving true emotional and financial comfort.

          <p>The article analyzes the implications of a recent IRS policy change that allows clergy to endorse political candidates without risking their church's nonprofit status. The author argues that while this may seem like a victory for some religious groups, it could be a "Faustian bargain" that degrades churches by turning them into political organizations. The piece suggests this change will likely intensify polarization within congregations and make churches susceptible to pressure from political donors and activists. It contrasts this with the approach of forming congregants' consciences to make their own informed political decisions, as some religious bodies still advocate.</p>

The piece explains that the rising incidence of skin cancer globally is likely due to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products.

Recent moves to discipline a small group of dissenting backbench MPs are seen by some as a sign of weakness rather than strength, revealing a government "spooked" by internal resistance. Furthermore, the administration faces significant constraints from financial markets, which dictate fiscal policy and limit spending ambitions to avoid the instability seen under previous governments.
