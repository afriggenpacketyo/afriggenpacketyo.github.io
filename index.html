          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Ward's selection continues a trend of quarterbacks being chosen first overall, marking the third consecutive year a quarterback has been the top pick. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter second overall, showcasing the draft's unpredictability. This year's draft class is not considered as talent-laden as previous years, with a focus on offensive and defensive lines in the early picks. The draft continues with rounds two and three on Friday, and rounds four through seven on Saturday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea believed to be rich in gas and oil, could become a future flashpoint between China and the Philippines. This is especially likely if Manila pursues unilateral resource exploration to enhance its energy security. The area holds an estimated 5.4 billion barrels of oil and 1.56 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. Tensions between China and the Philippines have stalled joint development efforts, and factors like Manila's limited capacity and US geopolitical priorities may delay the conflict, but the potential for escalation remains high.</p>

          <p>Faustin Nsabumukunzi, a Rwandan beekeeper living in the Hamptons, has been charged with immigration fraud for allegedly concealing his participation in the Rwandan genocide.

He allegedly lied about his involvement when seeking refugee status and citizenship in the United States. Nsabumukunzi faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted and could be deported to Rwanda, where he has been sought for nearly two decades.</p>

          <p>Ryan Hemphill, a private equity executive in New York City, has been charged with predatory sexual assault and other crimes related to the alleged sexual assault, torture, and abuse of six women.

He allegedly met the women on dating websites, offered them money for sex, and then reenacted their past traumas during the assaults. Hemphill faces life in prison if convicted, and the judge has ordered him to remain jailed due to concerns about him fleeing the country.</p>

          <p>During talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, the U.S. did not pressure Japan to prop up the yen.

Kato expressed regret over Trump's tariffs and urged a review of protectionist measures, while Bessent acknowledged Japan's concerns.

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funds to sanctuary cities and counties. The judge declared that portions of Trump's executive orders were unconstitutional, citing irreparable harm in the form of budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust between local governments and their communities. The ruling prohibits the federal government from withholding or conditioning federal funds and requires written notice of the order to all federal departments and agencies. This decision echoes a previous ruling against a similar Trump order in 2017.</p>

Cassis highlighted the significant impact of these tariffs on Switzerland's small and open economy, underscoring the need for collective action to address the challenges posed by protectionist measures.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that China could improve its soft power and public image in Africa by developing its own model of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). While China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Africa, these efforts are largely government-led, lacking the grass-roots relationships and community engagement that Western NGOs cultivate. The author argues that a Chinese NGO model could address the narrative of China as a neocolonial power and build stronger human connections, especially as more Chinese companies and workers move to Africa.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faced a series of legal setbacks in federal courts, with judges blocking the government on issues ranging from education policy and voting rights to sanctuary jurisdictions. Judges blocked the administration from withholding federal funds to schools with DEI programs and from requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote. The administration is also facing scrutiny over its immigration policies, adding to the nearly 200 lawsuits it is battling in court.</p>
