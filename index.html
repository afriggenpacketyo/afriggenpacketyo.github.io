          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups in the Americas can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing genetic codes that changed in people from different geographical regions and various Indigenous groups. This allowed them to study patterns of population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years and understand the origins of South American communities.</p>

The escape has led to criticism of the Sheriffâ€™s Office, with officials questioning the security protocols and the delay in notifying the public.

          <p>Russia is increasingly recruiting Ukrainians to carry out acts of sabotage in Europe, offering rewards like cash and luxury goods through encrypted apps. One case involves a 17-year-old Ukrainian refugee in Poland who was allegedly offered $11,000 and a BMW to burn down an Ikea in Lithuania. European security sources note a rise in the use of "disposable" agents as part of Russia's hybrid-war campaign targeting military sites and infrastructure.

Currently active tariffs include a 10% universal tariff, 25% on cars and auto parts (with exceptions), 30% on Chinese imports (with exceptions), and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by the USMCA. Paused tariffs include "reciprocal" tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods. Exemptions have been made for goods covered under the USMCA and certain electronics imported from China.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that Trump supporters interpreted as a veiled threat against President Donald Trump. The post featured seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47." Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, but Trump and administration officials rejected his explanation. The Secret Service investigation underscores the ongoing tension between Trump and Comey, who has been a vocal critic of the president.</p>

The storm, fueled by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, caused drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony.

          <p>The federal sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution case against Sean "Diddy" Combs hinges on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura, who alleges years of abuse and coerced participation in unwanted sex acts. Ventura described a tumultuous relationship with Combs, including instances of violence and drug-fueled "freak-offs." Prosecutors are using Ventura's testimony to build their sex trafficking and racketeering case, arguing that Combs used force, fraud, or coercion and led a criminal enterprise to cover up his alleged crimes. Combs denies the charges, while his attorneys concede he was abusive but argue that domestic violence is not sex trafficking.</p>

The town's mayor expressed concern that the U.S. had abandoned free trade as a path to peace, while Bosnia's trade minister showed little interest in saving the ammunition companies.
