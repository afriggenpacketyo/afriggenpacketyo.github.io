            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, focusing on stabilizing the yuan amidst trade tensions with the U.S. This decision aligns with better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter, giving the PBOC leeway to keep rates steady. The LPRs, which influence corporate and mortgage rates, have remained constant since October of the previous year. Following the announcement, the Chinese yuan traded flat against the dollar, and the CSI 300 index rose slightly.</p>

A spokesperson for the Chinese commerce ministry responded to reports indicating that Washington plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes. The Trump administration has initiated tariff discussions with several trading partners, including Japan and South Korea, following the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports and levies on goods from other countries since Trump's return to the White House.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal attorney. The messages, sent on March 15, contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets. This incident follows a previous instance where Hegseth inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief in a similar Signal chat, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information.

            <p>JPMorgan anticipates that President Trump's tariff policies will result in some trade deals between the U.S. and its partners, but overall tax rates will significantly increase. Their base case suggests an effective tariff rate between 10% and 20%, a notable rise from the previous 2%. While this scenario is expected to slow economic growth and increase unemployment and inflation, JPMorgan believes the U.S. will narrowly avoid a recession.

            <p>Season 2 of HBO's *The Last of Us* adapts the controversial events of *The Last of Us Part II*, most notably Joel's brutal death. While the show expands on the game's storytelling, some plot detours and character motivations feel awkwardly inserted. The adaptation's focus on unrelenting pain, rather than exploring the complexities of violence and fractured bonds, results in a more circular and suffocating narrative compared to the first season. The show's limited imagination prevents it from delving into Ellie’s larger emotional journey, making it a punishing watch.</p>

The decision to return the aircraft highlights the disruptive effects of the ongoing trade tensions on international commerce and aviation.

            <p>Defense secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly creating a Signal group chat and sharing confidential details of a US strike on Yemen with his wife, brother, and others. This incident follows a previous communications blunder by national security advisor Mike Waltz, who also used Signal to discuss the Yemen strikes, inadvertently including the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic. President Trump downplayed the first incident as a “glitch”. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to support Kilmar Ábrego García’s due process in a wrongful deportation dispute.</p>

            <p>A Texas man, Sarmad Ghaled Dafar, was sentenced to four months in custody for trafficking vulnerable Mexican baby spider monkeys into San Diego and selling them on Facebook. The crime was uncovered in 2023 when agents intercepted three baby spider monkeys smuggled across the border. Dafar admitted to coordinating the trafficking and arranging their sale, and has been ordered to pay restitution for the monkeys' quarantine. The spider monkeys are now permanently housed at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.</p>

            <p>South Korea has discovered increasing attempts to disguise foreign products, primarily from China, as Korean exports to evade U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Korea Customs Service found 29.5 billion won ($20.81 million) worth of country-of-origin violations in the first quarter, with 97% of the shipments bound for the U.S. This marks a significant increase compared to the total violations in 2024, prompting the launch of a special task force to prevent illegal export attempts and protect domestic companies.</p>

Rather than seeking immediate negotiations, China is focusing on resolving its internal economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market. The government is exploring fiscal stimulus measures and emphasizing self-reliance in key industries. The key is for it to resolve its own economic weaknesses.</p>

            <p>Despite the rollout of the 'free hours' childcare scheme in England, parents continue to face difficulties in finding nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. Experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out, with demand for childcare increasing while access declines. Private nurseries, which provide most early years places, are struggling with rising operating costs, and staffing shortages remain a significant problem. The government is increasing funding and clamping down on extra charges, but the system remains under strain.</p>

Gatwick has been affected by ATC staff shortages in continental Europe and its own control tower. Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality performance in the UK.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Data reveals that men visit doctors less often than women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become severe, influenced by societal pressures to "tough it out" and perceptions of vulnerability. Research indicates men are less likely to be registered at dental practices or use pharmacies, and they tend to self-manage conditions more than women. Factors contributing to this reluctance include appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns, a focus on treatment rather than prevention, and societal expectations around masculinity. Support groups and reframing healthcare as problem-solving can encourage men to seek medical help earlier.</p>

Many vehicles lack essential safety features, and road designs often fail to account for the diverse range of users and traffic patterns. Despite efforts to improve road safety, challenges remain in enforcement, infrastructure, and human behavior.</p>

Amorim emphasized the need for the team to score more goals and vowed to continue working with Hojlund to improve his form.
