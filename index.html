          <h2>Japanese Volleyball Stars Advocate for Players' Union to Enhance SV.League</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese volleyball players in the SV.League, including national team star Yuji Nishida, are calling for the formation of a players' union to address issues such as the crowded match schedule and promote the league's goal of becoming a global benchmark. Nishida highlighted concerns about the uneven distribution of matches against different opponents and the lack of promotion opportunities for second-division teams. Teammate Thomas Jaeschke also pointed out that the current schedule of back-to-back weekend matches is physically demanding and unsustainable for players, suggesting adjustments similar to European leagues. The league believes the current schedule is ideal for fans to attend matches and reduces costs, enabling match organizers to set up and clear a venue once per weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have indicated that new trade deals could be announced soon, as the administration faces pressure to strike agreements before a pause on reciprocal tariffs ends on July 9.

Democrats have also criticized the bill, arguing that Congress should focus on more pressing issues.

          <p>Despite initial appearances of economic stability, President Trump's trade war is showing signs of self-defeat, with worrisome data emerging in key sectors. The article highlights declining trucking volumes, plummeting shipping volumes at West Coast ports, and canceled orders for American farmers as indicators of impending trouble. Reduced consumer spending and shaken consumer confidence are also contributing to the economic downturn. The author warns that the deeper effects of the trade war may not be felt until late summer, when businesses run out of stockpiled inventories and are forced to cut back on investment and hiring.</p>

          <p>The Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is promoting a costly, time-consuming and distinctly unethical order for testing vaccines, demanding placebo-controlled trials for new vaccines. This policy is dangerous, since it is not ethical to test a vaccine against a true placebo when a known treatment already exists. The article criticizes Kennedy's stance as dangerous and misinformed, emphasizing the importance of community-wide vaccination efforts. Hiltzik points out that a full-scale Phase 3 clinical trial requires as many as 3,000 participants and can take as long as four years.</p>

It also touches on the author's ability to connect the cultural impact of Malcolm X with the legal proceedings surrounding his death. Whitaker mounts a convincing argument that knowing the manâ€™s name is more important now than ever. The author writes, â€œToday, amid a backlash against affirmative action, so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and other measures designed to rectify past racial injustice, Malcolmâ€™s calls for Black self-reliance have never seemed more urgent.</p>

The alleged shooters, members of the Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips, believed Jacobs was associated with the Black P-Stones, a rival gang, because he was wearing a baseball cap with a red brim. Jacobs was not affiliated with any gang, but prosecutors argue that the case highlights the ongoing issue of gang violence and mistaken identity in Los Angeles. The attorneys for the alleged killers argue that there is no evidence to suggest Jacobs was mistaken for a gang member.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a significant reduction in funding for federal rental assistance programs, which could disproportionately affect California. The plan calls for a 43% reduction in funding for programs like public housing and Section 8, while also giving states more responsibility and flexibility in how they are run. Advocates for low-income households criticize the proposal, arguing that it would worsen the housing affordability crisis and increase homelessness. The administration argues that the cuts will streamline existing programs and encourage state and local governments to take more responsibility.</p>

          <p>Despite promises from California lawmakers to address the rising cost of living, a new poll reveals that voters in the state are growing increasingly pessimistic about their financial future. Concerns about the cost of living, housing affordability, and homelessness top the list of issues for state leaders to address. The shift in voter sentiment is attributed to President Trump's return to the White House and his subsequent implementation of sweeping tariffs. While Democrats have introduced legislation to alleviate financial burdens, these efforts are not expected to bring about dramatic changes to California's longstanding economic problems.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that President Trump can no longer blame President Biden for the state of the economy, as Trump's own policies, particularly tariffs, are now the primary drivers of economic conditions. The article points out that Trump's boasts about attracting investments to the U.S. are undermined by his family's businesses investing abroad. The author predicts that the economic chaos and uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs will stick with him through the 2026 midterm elections. Moreover, the Republican's fiscal policies are turning the annual federal budget-writing process into an exercise in overreach and hubris, and the debt will explode again.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 2026 budget is facing criticism for its failure to address the drivers of the fiscal crisis, despite initial appearances of advocating for small-government principles. While the budget includes cuts to domestic agencies and gestures towards federalism, it sustains a bloated government with discretionary spending remaining essentially unchanged. The budget also proposes a significant increase in defense spending, raising concerns about accountability within the Pentagon. The article argues that without serious entitlement reform, no discretionary spending cuts can avert a debt crisis, and the budget ultimately represents another big-government blueprint in small-government clothing.</p>
