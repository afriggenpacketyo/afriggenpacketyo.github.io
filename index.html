        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, citing concerns about state sovereignty and potential escalation of civil unrest. Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that the deployment poses "imminent harm" and could exacerbate tensions rather than quell them. The lawsuit claims Trump's actions are unlawful, as he federalized the California National Guard without Newsom's consent. The legal challenge underscores the ongoing conflict between state and federal authority regarding immigration enforcement and the use of military personnel in domestic affairs. </p>

The defense aims to challenge the narrative of coercion, while the prosecution seeks to highlight the emotional and psychological impact of the alleged pressure.
