          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains belonging to the seven people reported missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The blast, which occurred at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility, also sparked grass fires that burned approximately 80 acres. Investigations revealed the company lacked local permits to store fireworks on the agricultural property, which is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting Cal Fire in the ongoing investigation into the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is confronting a severe funding crisis, exacerbated by a potential 87% cut in U.S. contributions under the Trump administration. This threatens essential agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme, which are already grappling with declining donations and a record number of global crises. The article argues that this move symbolizes a broader assault on multilateralism and the international rules-based order, which the UN has embodied for 80 years. Without the UN, the world could face increased instability, conflict, and humanitarian suffering, leaving a void that could be filled by global anarchy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 01:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that MI5's internal investigations into its own misconduct were "deficient" and has ordered a new, more robust inquiry. The case centers on the security service repeatedly providing false evidence to courts to conceal that it had confirmed the identity of a violent neo-Nazi agent to a BBC journalist. This agent had brutally abused his partner, "Beth," who is now suing MI5. The article reveals how MI5 continued to mislead the court and withhold key evidence, undermining its own inquiries which had initially blamed the failures on memory lapses rather than dishonesty.</p>

Key evidence included cell phone data placing her at the scene remotely, shared security system passwords, and secretly recorded conversations. Baker had previously pleaded no contest to the murder, and another accomplice testified against Monica, leading to a verdict that brings a long-awaited sense of justice for the victim's family.</p>

Traveling to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Twain, then an established East Coast author, confronted the changes to the landscape and culture he had cherished as a steamboat pilot. The passage highlights his profound sense of nostalgia and the freedom he associated with the pilot house, a sanctuary from the constraints of society. This return to his roots reveals the paradox of his life: the more famous he became, the more he longed for his past.</p>

          <h2>Israel to Send Negotiators to Qatar but Deems Hamas's Counter-Proposal 'Unacceptable'</h2>

          <p>Israel has agreed to send a negotiating team to Qatar for further ceasefire talks but has rejected the latest counter-proposal from Hamas, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office calling the requested changes "unacceptable." Hamas had earlier issued what it termed a "positive response" to a U.S.-mediated framework for a two-month truce in the ongoing war. While President Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon, the conflicting statements from Israel and Hamas indicate that significant obstacles remain. The negotiations are aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long conflict that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.</p>
