          <h2>Restaurant Stocks Plunge Amid Recession and Sales Slowdown Fears</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 13:57:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Restaurant stocks experienced a significant decline due to investor concerns about an impending recession, exacerbated by President Trump's tariffs on key trading partners. Analysts believe that while the direct impact of tariffs on restaurants may be manageable, the resulting inflation could strain consumer spending and industry demand. Starbucks shares notably fell after a downgrade citing near-term economic headwinds and concerns over coffee costs due to tariffs. The trade tensions also pose risks to Starbucks' international sales, particularly in China, where consumer boycotts of Western brands have occurred previously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's executive orders ending diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) efforts in the federal government, numerous employees with past involvement in DEIA roles have been terminated, even if they were not currently working in DEIA positions. These employees argue that their jobs do not conflict with the executive orders and believe they are being targeted for their perceived political affiliations. One such employee, Mahri Stainnak, has filed a complaint alleging unlawful firing, leading to legal challenges and warnings about the loss of experienced civil servants. The White House defends the actions, asserting the President's authority to manage personnel and end unlawful DEI practices.</p>

          <p>European Union policymakers are worried about a potential surge of inexpensive Chinese imports into the region as President Trump's tariffs on China redirect goods intended for the U.S. market.

          <p>Technology stocks experienced volatile trading as President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to sweeping global tariff plans, following a significant market sell-off the previous week. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks largely declined after a brief rally. The tech sector had previously suffered substantial losses, with the Nasdaq Composite entering a bear market. The market's reaction reflects ongoing uncertainty about the impact of tariffs on the technology industry and the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats are criticizing President Trump for spending the weekend golfing as markets tumbled in response to his sweeping tariffs. They argue that Trump's actions demonstrate a lack of concern for Americans' financial anxieties. Several Democratic lawmakers have publicly condemned Trump's policies and his decision to spend time on the golf course while the economy faces significant challenges. Trump, however, has encouraged Americans to "HANG TOUGH" amid the economic turmoil.</p>

          <p>While President Trump's tariffs have triggered market volatility, historical data suggests that market downturns often present opportunities for long-term investors. Bear markets, though concerning, have historically been followed by periods of recovery and growth. Experts advise investors to view downturns as entry points to buy assets at a discount, assuming they have the resources to continue investing regularly. The long-term upward trajectory of the stock market has historically reduced the greatest economic calamities into blips.</p>

          <p>Economists are warning that President Trump's tariffs could lead to stagflation, a rare and challenging economic crisis characterized by stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment. The tariffs, functioning as taxes on imported goods, are expected to increase inflation and slow economic growth. While opinions differ on the severity and duration of the potential stagflation, economists broadly agree that the tariffs are likely to produce both higher inflation and slower growth.</p>

          <p>A radio station's decision to rehire Thom Brennaman, a broadcaster who made a homophobic slur in 2020, has drawn criticism. Critics argue that the decision is tone-deaf and reflects a broader pattern of tolerance for discriminatory behavior. Brennaman's support for President Trump, whose administration implemented anti-LGBTQ policies, is cited as a contributing factor to his actions. The controversy highlights ongoing debates about accountability and inclusivity in media.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Tufts University's Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice are working to address racial disparities in maternal health care.

Their research has already contributed to policy changes, such as the "Momnibus Bill," aimed at improving access to midwifery care.</p>

          <p>As stocks tank and volatility rises due to President Trump's tariffs, bonds are providing a lower-risk option for investors. Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are rising, but experts note a shift toward actively managed bond strategies. While active stock managers often struggle to outperform indexes, active bond ETFs have shown more consistent outperformance. Investors may be willing to pay higher management fees for the potential of greater returns in the fixed-income market. (not investment advice)</p>
