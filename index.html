            <p>A group of former OpenAI employees have filed a brief supporting Elon Musk's lawsuit against the AI company, expressing concerns about its transition into a for-profit entity. These ex-staffers, who worked at OpenAI between 2018 and 2024, believe that the shift would violate the company's original mission and breach the trust of stakeholders. OpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, is currently facing legal challenges from Musk, who alleges that the company has abandoned its founding commitment to develop AI for the benefit of humanity. OpenAI has filed a countersuit against Musk, accusing him of attempting to harm the company's operations.</p>

            <p>Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, causing life-threatening injuries including burns, scalds, and stab wounds. Abedi used hot cooking oil and homemade weapons in the assault, which took place in a separation center housing the country's most dangerous extremist prisoners. The Prison Officers' Association is calling for a review of freedoms given to prisoners in these centers, while the Justice Secretary has vowed to pursue the strongest possible punishment. Abedi is serving a minimum of 55 years for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people.</p>

Nine aid workers were killed in Zamzam camp, with Relief International mourning the loss of its personnel in what it described as a targeted attack on health infrastructure.

            <p>Dive teams are returning to the Hudson River to recover remaining wreckage from a fatal helicopter crash that killed all six people on board. Experts believe that key missing parts, including the main rotor and transmission, could provide crucial insights into the cause of the crash. A preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off, leading to the uncontrolled descent into the river. Authorities are exploring various theories, including mechanical failure, bird strikes, and drone interference.</p>

            <p>The near collapse of the US government debt market due to Trump's trade policies has weakened the US president, creating an advantage for Europe and the UK. These rule-of-law democracies should work together to capitalize on this opportunity, forming a global pact to avoid protectionist policies and create a global customs union. While China must be engaged with, it is not a benevolent power, but rather a lynchpin of "Autocracy Inc". Britain should ally with the EU in negotiations with Trump and pursue a deeper trade deal with the EU.</p>

            <p>Al Hurra, a U.S.-funded Arabic-language television and online news outlet, has terminated most of its staff and TV programming due to funding cuts. Chief Jeffrey Gedmin accused the Trump administration of unlawfully withholding congressionally approved funds. Al Hurra is one of several U.S. government-funded news outlets that have been affected by these cuts. Kari Lake, the Trump appointee overseeing the agency, has described it as being consumed by a “giant rot” that requires the agency's destruction and rebuilding.</p>
