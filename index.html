        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Gaza health workers, at least four Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire near an aid distribution center in Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that warning shots were fired after a verbal challenge to a group moving towards them that was deemed a threat. The incident occurred near a site set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by Israel and the US, and is part of a new aid system bypassing the UN. Humanitarian groups have widely condemned this system, citing previous deadly incidents during GHF's operations and raising concerns about its workability and ethics, with over 60 Palestinians killed in its first three days. The Israeli army has declared the GHF distribution sites active combat zones outside of specified hours. </p>

The J-36 fighter features three weapons bays and a dorsal intake for the third engine, which is likely used to provide additional thrust for cruising at supersonic speeds. These jets may also have the ability to work with combat drones. The latest image of the J-36 shows the aircraft parked on a tarmac at Chengdu Aircraft Corporationâ€™s main plant in Sichuan province, offering the closest look at the mysterious jet so far.

          <p>The Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning was spotted near Japan's easternmost island in the Pacific, marking the first time a Chinese carrier has sailed in those waters, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry. The carrier, along with two destroyers and another vessel, was seen about 300 kilometers southwest of Minamitori Island. The Liaoning then moved southwest and conducted landing and takeoff drills involving its fighter jets and helicopters. This move highlights the Chinese navy's expanding activities in waters around Japan, prompting the Japanese government to increase its information-gathering and surveillance efforts.</p>

The Folger Shakespeare Library, recently renovated, houses the world's largest collection of Shakespeare's First Folios. Dowd notes Shakespeare's influence on America's Founding Fathers and draws parallels between his characters and modern political figures, highlighting the Bard's timeless understanding of power and human nature.</p>

          <p>Pomona College is seeing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the influence of technology on campus life. Students are advocating for more classes without electronic devices, forming a "Luddite Club" for tech-free socializing, and even switching to flip phones. Some professors are limiting or banning devices in their classes and curbing the use of ChatGPT. This effort aims to foster a closer-knit community and encourage deeper engagement with academic material, differentiating Pomona from other institutions that heavily promote technology use. The administration has yet to fully align with this vision, but the movement highlights concerns about the impact of technology on learning and social interaction.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program has net positive approval, particularly among Republicans, but is heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support is strong when people believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but drops significantly if they think it targets others. Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, leading to disapproval. Concerns about due process and the potential for mistakenly deporting legal residents persist, while views on the program's economic impact are largely negative. The poll also shows that Trump's approval rating on immigration is higher than on the economy or inflation.</p>

The piece references examples like Adam Neumann of WeWork, Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed in *The Social Network*, and Elon Musk to illustrate how the mythologizing of powerful men often overlooks their flaws and negative impacts. The author suggests that this narrative impulse is rooted in America's origin story and has led to an unregulated economy where theft and self-dealing are commonplace. The article calls for a shift away from blindly celebrating people for "changing the world" and a recognition of the ideology of dominance.</p>

          <p>As the Home Office and Treasury negotiate this week's Spending Review, the science and technology secretary has urged police to "do their bit" and "embrace change." Peter Kyle stated that all sectors are struggling and the chancellor is facing pressure from doctors and universities to increase funding. He affirmed that the review would boost spending for schools and scientific research but didn't dismiss a squeeze on policing. The shadow home secretary expressed concern about potential police number cuts and urged the government to protect their budget, citing Labour's excessive spending.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign ahead of the recent Holyrood by-election, claiming the SNP's tactics pushed voters towards Reform UK. Swinney defended his "two-horse race" remark, citing Labour's vote share collapse and a surge for Reform. Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat, defeating the SNP. Sarwar criticized the SNP campaign for lacking ambition and "running down the clock" on its time in government, while urging Sir Keir Starmer's government to deliver change that puts extra money in people's pockets.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom denounced the potential deployment of US Marines in his state as "deranged" after the Secretary of Defense threatened their use amid immigration protests. Tensions escalated after ICE raids led to clashes between protesters and law enforcement.

The Los Angeles Mayor clarified that the National Guard had not yet been deployed, while Trump praised their actions despite their absence.

Mao Zedong warned about this threat, but China has since become a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts. The author suggests that Trump's actions have inadvertently lessened the perceived danger of American conspiracies aimed at subverting China, as the US no longer promotes its values as aggressively.</p>
