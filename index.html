          <p>Samsung Electronics reported first-quarter operating profit and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong sales of Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The South Korean tech giant posted a 10% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 1.5% rise in operating profit, despite macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and global growth slowdown. While the company anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year, Samsung remains cautious about ongoing global economic challenges. This article highlights Samsung's resilience in a competitive market while also acknowledging the potential impact of external factors on its future performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mexico’s Attorney General, Alejandro Gertz, stated that an abandoned ranch in Teuchitlán, Jalisco, previously described as an “extermination camp” by groups searching for missing relatives, was actually a training and recruitment center for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Gertz clarified that there is no definitive evidence of human cremations at the site, despite earlier claims. This statement contrasts with previous reports and the beliefs of search groups who maintain that cremations occurred based on their findings at the ranch. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities still working to identify bone fragments found at the location, which has complicated the case.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hailed his tariffs policy as the end of "the era of economic surrender" during his 100th-day speech, but official White House and Treasury Department releases barely mentioned them, focusing instead on broader economic indicators. Trump claimed countries, including China, were seeking trade deals to avoid tariffs, despite China's denials. While emphasizing that the tension around tariffs "doesn't mean we're not going to get along," Trump described "China tariffs" as a historic effort to curb job theft from the U.S. This article highlights the discrepancy between Trump's public rhetoric and the administration's official messaging on trade policy.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, announced that a second round of tariff talks with the United States will be held in Washington, D.C., as Japan seeks exemptions from higher duties affecting autos, steel, and other sectors. The U.S. has expressed dissatisfaction with the number of U.S.-made cars imported into Japan and has pushed for greater access for U.S.-grown crops. Japan is considering proposing an increase in U.S.-grown soybean and corn imports and may offer simplified checks for more car imports to ease trade tensions.

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were in housing, education, and food, offset by falls in recreation and household goods. Inflation has been softening since peaking at 7.8% in December 2022, allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates to 4.1%. The RBA expects continued economic growth and a strong labor market, though global uncertainties remain. This article examines Australia's inflation trends and the central bank's response.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump eased the impact of new 25% tariffs on the auto industry, allowing automakers producing vehicles in the United States to claim some reimbursements over the next two years. This relief aims to help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts used in the U.S. Automakers can offset 15% of the suggested retail price of a U.S.-assembled automobile in the first year and 10% in the second year.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity fell more than expected in April, dropping to a near two-year low as the escalating trade war with the U.S. negatively impacts bilateral trade.

U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed cumulative new tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods, leading to disruptions in trade flows.

          <p>Nearly 400 scientists were dismissed from their roles in writing the National Climate Assessment, a major report on climate change mandated by Congress. The Trump administration stated that the "scope" of the assessment is being "reevaluated." Concerns have been raised about how the report will be written without the expertise of these scientists. This move aligns with Project 2025, which aims to reshape the report and the office that organizes it. This article explores the implications of this decision for climate research and policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has begun criminal prosecutions of migrants for entering a newly declared military buffer zone along the border with Mexico. At least 28 migrants were charged in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, for crossing into the 170-mile-long militarized zone. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the area and said it was the start of a plan to extend the buffer zone along the border.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that walked back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors, and others complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. The changes will modify Trump’s tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25% tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over the next two years.
