          <p>Tesla denied a Wall Street Journal report stating that the company's board was seeking a replacement for Elon Musk as CEO. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm refuted the report on X, asserting that it was false and that the board has full confidence in Musk's leadership. The denial comes amidst a backdrop of declining sales and profits for the electric vehicle maker, with Musk acknowledging that his involvement with the Trump administration could be impacting the stock price. He plans to dedicate only a couple days per week to the Department of Government Efficiency starting in May. Optimism about Tesla's stability remains relatively high despite recent challenges.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, leading to an increase in its full-year adjusted earnings guidance. The company's insurance business, particularly Aetna, demonstrated signs of recovery after facing challenges related to higher medical costs. The medical benefit ratio decreased, indicating improved profitability in the insurance unit, which can be partially attributed to stronger performance in the Medicare business. Despite these positive developments, CVS revised its GAAP diluted EPS guidance downward due to charges related to a legal battle involving its Omnicare subsidiary.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton shared his insights on President Trump's second term, characterizing it as even more incoherent than the first. Bolton suggested that Trump's primary motivation is to be the center of attention and that his decisions are often reactions rather than part of a grand strategy. Despite concerns about constitutional infringements, Bolton does not view Trump as an existential threat, expressing confidence in the strength of American institutions. He believes that the judicial system will ultimately act as a check on Trump's actions, although legal challenges will likely cause aggravation and expense.</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will be prohibited from participating in women's football in England starting June 1. The decision follows a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman based on biological sex. The FA acknowledged the difficulty this will pose for transgender women who wish to play the sport, and sources indicate that the Scottish FA is likely to adopt a similar policy. The FA is contacting registered transgender women to explain the changes and discuss how they can continue to be involved in the sport.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and its unionized baristas are embroiled in a labor standoff, with negotiations for a contract stalled for over two years. Union members recently rejected Starbucks' latest proposal, which guaranteed annual raises but did not offer immediate pay increases or establish a minimum number of scheduled work hours. Starbucks contends that it already offers competitive pay and benefits, while the union argues that the company's offer does not provide economic justice for its workers. Both sides remain committed to working towards a resolution, though the dispute over wages continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid tariff turmoil at Los Angeles-area ports, bonded warehouses, where goods can be stored without paying tariffs, are experiencing a surge in demand. Importers are seeking to rent space in these warehouses to delay tariff payments while hoping for a resolution to trade tensions. However, only a small fraction of industrial property in the region is bonded, making space scarce. While many importers are canceling orders, others are choosing to pay tariffs to maintain relationships with retailers. The Trump Administration’s tariff changes are significantly reshaping import costs and supply chain strategies across industries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive orders and policies are creating a summer of dissent, fear, and military maneuvers in California, particularly concerning sanctuary cities and immigrant rights. The administration's push to centralize power, coupled with actions like expanding military authority over civilians and targeting sanctuary cities, raises concerns about potential constitutional infringements. The article highlights the risk of the Insurrection Act being invoked and the use of federal powers to police dissent, leading to fears of a security state. Despite the challenges, the author expresses hope that people will push back against these measures and protect democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months into his tenure, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell's plans to overhaul the department face uncertainty due to a $1-billion budget gap and potential civilian layoffs. While McDonnell cited delays caused by wildfires, concerns are growing about the department's ability to maintain core functions and respond to community needs. Council members are exploring options to save positions, but the potential loss of civilian workers could impact essential services, such as crime scene photography and evidence analysis. The chief has said that it would be "very questionable" to plan for a future with "major increases" to the department’s size.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County's juvenile halls are facing increasing scrutiny due to a series of fiascoes, including drug overdoses, brawls, and reports of abuse. The California attorney general is considering placing the Probation Department, which oversees the halls, in receivership due to its failure to implement court-ordered reforms. Despite state oversight and agreements, the Probation Department has struggled to improve conditions, leading to calls for intervention to protect the safety and well-being of the youths in custody. Recent incidents, such as the overdoses at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall and the indictment of officers for arranging "gladiator fights," have intensified the pressure on authorities to take action.</p>

          <p>California's decision to dismantle its death row has dramatically altered the lives of condemned inmates, transferring them to other prisons and granting them new freedoms. Inmates, who once spent over 20 hours a day in solitary confinement, now have opportunities to interact with others, participate in rehabilitative programs, and even work. While prison reform advocates celebrate this change, victims' families express anger and resignation, arguing that it undermines the justice they were promised. Despite the new opportunities, some inmates face challenges adjusting to general population and grappling with the stigma of their past crimes.</p>

Despite these revisions, the BOJ has maintained its benchmark interest rate, signaling its commitment to raising interest rates further if economic conditions improve.

          <p>A BBC News analysis identifies key aspects of the US-Ukraine minerals deal. The agreement does not require Ukraine to repay aid to the US. The deal includes provisions for oil and gas projects alongside mineral extraction. It does not hinder Ukraine's EU ambitions. The US has framed the deal as a necessary condition for continued military assistance to Ukraine, though the US can walk away at any time. Profits will be reinvested in Ukraine for 10 years. The tone from the US is notably harsher toward Russia than usual, signaling a commitment to a free and sovereign Ukraine.</p>
