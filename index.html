          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Milwaukee Brewers in an 8-7 game, marking their ninth loss in eleven games. Despite a notable offensive improvement, including seven runs and a three-RBI performance from Shohei Ohtani, the team's pitching and defense struggled to contain the Brewers. The Dodgers' lineup showed flashes of its potential but failed to capitalize on key opportunities, ultimately unable to overcome a poor start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a costly bullpen performance. The loss highlights the team's ongoing search for consistent play during a difficult stretch of their season.</p>

          <p>Violent sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin groups in southern Syria have continued, despite a ceasefire declared by the country's interim president. Reports indicate Druze fighters pushed Bedouin gunmen out of Suweida city, but fighting persists elsewhere in the province, with over 900 people reportedly killed in the past week. The Syrian government deployed forces to quell the violence, though they have been accused of participating in attacks on the Druze. International actors, including the US and Israel, have called for an end to the violence and protection for minority communities.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals listed as missing after recent devastating floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified that most of the unaccounted-for individuals were safe. The floods, which occurred around July 4, resulted in 134 deaths across Texas, with 107 of those fatalities in Kerr County alone. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery from the widespread natural disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are severely impacting small, rural radio stations that provide essential local news and information. Stations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves remote communities in West Virginia and Virginia, rely heavily on this funding and now face potential staff cuts or closure. While the cuts were partly motivated by perceptions of political bias at national outlets like NPR, the consequences are most dire for non-partisan local stations that serve as a primary information source in areas with limited internet access. This situation highlights a growing divide in media access and the unintended consequences of national political battles. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article posits that the escalating number and brutality of global conflicts, from Gaza to Ukraine, stem from a profound collapse of a universal moral framework. The author argues that the routine targeting of civilians and the use of atrocities as weapons of war persist because of moral relativism, where actions indefensible to one group are justified by another. This ethical fracture is mirrored in the breakdown of the international rules-based order, making peaceful resolutions nearly impossible. The piece suggests that a return to shared, universal ethical standards is necessary to counter the current trend of perpetual, polarizing conflict.</p>

          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Wisconsin was a complex case where technology played a pivotal role in both exonerating a suspect and convicting the killer. Initially, Vander Heyden's boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit corroborated his alibi that he was home during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Location data from Burch's Google Dashboard ultimately tracked his movements from a bar to the crime scene and where the body was dumped, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred mid-song while she was suspended over the audience, startling the singer but not preventing her from quickly recovering and continuing her performance. After the song concluded, Perry addressed the malfunction with the comment, "Not today, Satan." The event highlights the risks associated with complex aerial stunts that have become common in large-scale concert productions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited the Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank to condemn an arson attack on the ancient Church of Saint George. Residents have blamed extremist Israeli settlers for the fire, which occurred amid a surge of violence in the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Huckabee, a staunch supporter of Israel, called the desecration of a place of worship an "act of terror" and insisted that those responsible must be found and prosecuted. The visit underscores growing international concern over rising settler violence in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges the paper defamed him by publishing a story about a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein that was purportedly signed by Trump. Trump has denied the report and called the letter a fake, while the lawsuit accuses the newspaper of "clear journalistic failures." A Dow Jones spokesperson expressed full confidence in their reporting and stated they will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, raising significant health concerns. These small, flavored pouches contain high levels of nicotine and are placed against the gum, providing a strong and addictive hit. Because they are not currently age-restricted like cigarettes or vapes, they are easily accessible to children. Dentists and health officials are warning about the damage these products cause to gums and the risk of hooking a new generation on a highly addictive substance, prompting calls for new legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The initial rollout of a UK government scheme to install "Great British Energy solar panels" in schools used panels manufactured by two Chinese firms, Aiko and Longi. This has drawn criticism due to concerns about supporting Chinese industry over domestic manufacturing and allegations of forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. The government-owned GB Energy stated that all contracts complied with UK modern slavery rules and that it is committed to ethical supply chains. The situation highlights the complexities of balancing green energy goals with ethical sourcing and domestic economic interests.</p>

          <p>Drivers dropping off or picking up passengers at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly parking in nearby lay-bys to avoid the official drop-off zone's "kiss-and-fly" charges. The fee, which is £6 for a 10-minute stay, is part of a trend of rising charges at major UK airports. Many drivers wait for a message from their arriving passengers before quickly picking them up near airport hotels to circumvent the cost. The practice highlights public frustration with what many see as extortionate fees for a brief service, a stark contrast to many major EU airports that offer free drop-offs.</p>

          <p>Russia is conducting a systematic campaign in occupied areas of Ukraine to erase Ukrainian national identity and instill pro-Russian ideology in children. This effort includes forcing schools to adopt Russian curricula, teaching from textbooks that justify the invasion, and organizing patriotic events and military-style youth groups like Yunarmia. Russian soldiers give "bravery lessons" in schools, and thousands of Ukrainian children have been taken on tours to Russia or relocated to "re-education camps." These actions, which aim to militarize and brainwash a generation, are considered violations of international humanitarian law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether the traditional six-week school summer holiday should be shortened and redistributed throughout the year. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and holiday costs for parents, and help with issues like "holiday hunger." However, teachers' unions are largely opposed, citing the need for the long break to recharge and plan, while some fear a shorter summer would just concentrate holiday demand and drive up prices further. The discussion reflects differing views on how the school calendar can best serve students, families, and educators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing global demand for lithium, essential for electric car batteries and other green technologies, is causing significant environmental damage in Chile's Atacama salt flats. The extraction process consumes vast amounts of water in the arid region, leading to drying wetlands, shrinking lagoons, and harm to local ecosystems, including flamingo populations. Indigenous communities report that their traditional way of life is being destroyed by the mining operations. This situation raises a critical question: whether the global race to decarbonize is inadvertently creating another environmental crisis for the communities at the source of the raw materials.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has stated that savers are missing out on financial rewards by being overly cautious and is encouraging a shift from cash savings to stocks and shares investments. The government plans to send details of investment opportunities to people with money in low-interest accounts and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the change. This has sparked a debate, with experts noting that women invest less than men and warning that a forced approach could backfire. The policy aims to make the UK a "nation of investors" to boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

While still exclusive and expensive, the new clubs prioritize personal accomplishment and creative merit over inherited status. This trend reflects the significant economic and demographic shifts occurring in India's rapidly expanding economy.</p>

While some genuine photographs of Trump and Epstein together do exist from past events, this particular image has been debunked.
