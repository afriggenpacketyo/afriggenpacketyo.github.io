          <p>CVS Health announced first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, leading to an increase in their full-year adjusted earnings guidance. The company's insurance business, Aetna, showed signs of improvement, with the medical benefit ratio decreasing to 87.3% from 90.4% the previous year, indicating higher profitability. CEO David Joyner stated that the company had anticipated higher medical costs and potential macro headwinds, which contributed to their cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. CVS is also monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, particularly on the pharmacy side of the business.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed a minerals deal that grants Washington preferential access to Kyiv's natural resources in exchange for the establishment of a reconstruction investment fund. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that this economic partnership aims to accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery and contribute to ending the conflict with Russia.

          <p>Eli Lilly reported first-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded expectations, driven by strong demand for its weight loss and diabetes medications. However, the pharmaceutical company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges associated with the acquisition of an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. Despite the profit adjustment, Eli Lilly maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion. The company's first-quarter revenue increased by 45% compared to the same period last year, reaching $12.73 billion.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how wealthy individuals finance their passion for owning racehorses and the potential for earning millions through events like the Kentucky Derby. Bank of America's Steven Mason, who specializes in equestrian clients, notes that horses are viewed as both a lifestyle and an investment, albeit an illiquid one with uncertain returns. While many owners have a lifelong connection to horses, an increasing number of entrepreneurs and hedge fund managers are entering the field. Horse ownership is often pursued for the enjoyment it brings, with potential financial returns viewed as a secondary benefit.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has rewritten crypto regulations in its first 100 days, marking a significant shift from the previous administration's stance.

Key appointments, including Jonathan Gould at the OCC and Paul Atkins at the SEC, signal support for crypto innovation and clarity.

The article also discusses the impact of Nazi ideology on women's sports and the exclusion of Jews from sports clubs, leading to the rise of purely Jewish sports clubs before their eventual destruction.</p>

The agreement could also clear the way for more consequential talks on U.S. military backing for Ukraine and on the terms of a possible cease-fire with Russia.

He blamed the "default" of the federal bureaucracy, which aims to spend what it did last year plus 5% indefinitely, for hindering their effectiveness.

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton offers his perspective on the first 100 days of President Trump's second term, describing it as even more incoherent than his first. Bolton argues that Trump lacks a cohesive philosophy or grand strategy and is primarily motivated by being the center of attention. While he acknowledges the administration's flurry of activity, he questions its long-term follow-through and effectiveness. Bolton expresses concern over constitutional infringements but maintains that the country's institutions are stronger than Trump and will ultimately survive.</p>

          <p>Local elections in England are serving as a key indicator of the altered political climate, with both the Labour and Conservative parties appearing weakened.

The elections will determine more than 1,600 council members and several regional mayors, with results expected to highlight the challenges faced by the main parties and the rise of populist and centrist alternatives.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration is attempting to intimidate the judiciary, which is seen as the only remaining check on his power. The arrest of a Wisconsin judge is cited as an example of these tactics, along with attacks on judges who have ruled against Trump's policies. The author argues that these actions, combined with demands on law firms, represent a challenge to the rule of law and are reminiscent of authoritarian regimes where courts are unable to invalidate government actions.</p>
