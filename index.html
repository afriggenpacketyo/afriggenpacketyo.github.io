          <p>Peter Sullivan, imprisoned since 1987 for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has been acquitted by the Court of Appeal following the emergence of new DNA evidence. The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred Sullivan's case back to court after semen samples from the crime scene revealed a DNA profile of an unknown attacker. Sullivan, appearing via video link, was visibly emotional upon hearing the verdict, which brings to a close a case that has spanned nearly four decades, highlighting the importance of ongoing review and reevaluation of criminal cases in light of new scientific advancements. The article underscores the potential for miscarriages of justice and the critical role of DNA evidence in rectifying such errors.</p>

          <p>Toyota has unveiled a redesigned version of its all-electric vehicle (EV) in the U.S., simplifying the name from "bZ4X" to "bZ" for the 2026 model year. This change aims to distance the updated model from its predecessor, which faced criticism and a recall due to wheel detachment issues. The 2026 bZ features a 25% increase in EV range, up to 50% improvement in horsepower, and fast-charging capabilities, addressing previous concerns.

          <p>House Republicans are seeking to tighten work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aiming to reduce government spending as part of President Trump's budget reconciliation bill. The proposal would raise the upper age limit for work requirements from 54 to 64 and include SNAP recipients with children above age 7. The House Agriculture Committee is tasked with finding $230 billion in spending cuts, arguing that SNAP has become inefficient and lacks accountability. The bill also proposes a 5% baseline benefit cost share for all states starting in 2028, potentially shifting some costs from the federal government to the states.</p>

          <p>An op-ed discusses the recent U.S.-China trade truce, cautioning against excessive optimism and suggesting it may be a temporary reprieve rather than the end of the trade crisis. While the truce involves a rollback of tariffs and a pledge to keep talking, the underlying structure of the trade relationship remains fragile. The author emphasizes the importance of strategic autonomy for China and the need for U.S. companies to diversify their supply chains, treating the truce as an opportunity to prepare for potential renewed volatility. The article suggests that businesses should fortify short-term plans and accelerate long-term diversification strategies to mitigate risks associated with the U.S.-China trade relationship.</p>

          <p>New data indicates that the U.S.-China trade war significantly impacted North American and Asian manufacturing, with a steep decline in purchasing activity in April. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index reveals that the pause on tariffs offers relief, but U.S. manufacturers remain anxious about long-term risks associated with China. Companies are aggressively stockpiling inventory, while purchasing activity in Asia is at its weakest since December 2023.

          <p>A blind taste test involving nearly 2,700 participants evaluated 122 plant-based meat products across 14 categories, revealing the top performers. Twenty products earned a "Tasty award," indicating that at least half of the participants rated them equal to or better than their animal-based counterparts. Impossible Foods stood out with six award-winning products. The study suggests that consumer preference for animal meat may be partially psychological, as taste differences become less significant when plant-based meats are incorporated into dishes.

Scientists calculated that the "evaporation time" depends on density, leading to a theoretical dissolution of the longest-lasting body, the white dwarf. The research also notes that new findings suggest dark energy, which makes up 70% of the universe, may be weakening, and if it ebbs with time, the universe could eventually collapse on itself.
