            <h2>Study Examines Why Men Avoid Visiting Doctors</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 20:17:45 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent study highlights the reasons men are less likely to seek medical help compared to women, citing societal pressures to appear tough and self-reliant. Many men avoid doctor's appointments until symptoms become severe, often delaying care due to concerns about being perceived as weak or burdensome. This reluctance affects health outcomes, with men less likely to attend routine check-ups or participate in preventative screenings. Experts suggest redesigning healthcare services to better accommodate men's needs and attitudes towards health, emphasizing action-oriented approaches rather than open discussions about feelings. </p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The court's order prevents the Trump administration from removing the detainees until further review, ensuring they have a chance to argue their case in court. The ACLU raised concerns that the men were being targeted due to alleged gang affiliations and faced potential imprisonment in El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison.
