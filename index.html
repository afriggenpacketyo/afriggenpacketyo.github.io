          <p>The U.S. government faces a potential shutdown by Wednesday if Republicans and Democrats fail to agree on a spending bill. This standoff is fueled by Democratic demands for health care concessions and the Trump administration's willingness to use a shutdown to accelerate federal workforce reductions. Essential services like border protection and law enforcement would continue, but many other government functions and non-essential workers would be impacted, potentially leading to economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan is experiencing a total internet blackout as Taliban authorities severed fiber optic connections nationwide, in what appears to be a new crackdown. A local Taliban spokesperson cited 'immoral activities' as the reason for the ban, ordered by leader Haibatullah Akhundzada. This communications halt is devastating for ordinary Afghans, impacting online education and business, and exacerbating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises under a regime that has already curtailed women's rights and free press.</p>
