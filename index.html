          <p>China is escalating its efforts to build a satellite internet network, Guo Wang, to rival SpaceX's Starlink, but a shortage of state-owned rockets is creating a significant bottleneck. This scarcity is forcing a potential choice between nationally prioritized projects and ambitious local initiatives like Shanghai's Qianfan, which has turned to private companies for launches. The competition for limited launch capacity highlights the growing tension between China's centralized space ambitions and regional commercial space development, potentially slowing its overall progress in the satellite internet race.</p>

In his speech, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the global trend of military buildup and the growing acceptance of nuclear weapons, echoing calls for peace from leaders like Pope Leo XIV and the UN Secretary-General amid current global tensions.</p>

          <p>A former staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Edward Coristine, was assaulted during an attempted carjacking in Washington, D.C., leading to the arrest of two 15-year-olds. The incident prompted President Trump to decry the city's crime rate as "out of control" and threaten to place the capital under federal control if local authorities do not take stricter measures. This event has reignited the debate over D.C.'s autonomy, as the Constitution grants Congress the power to govern the city, a power it has largely delegated since 1973.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced the cancellation of $500 million in funding for 22 projects developing mRNA vaccines for respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy, a long-time vaccine critic, stated the administration will prioritize what it considers safer platforms, such as whole-virus vaccines. Infectious disease experts have condemned the decision, warning that abandoning mRNA technology, which they credit with saving millions of lives, is a dangerous move that could hinder the response to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court to remove Democratic Representative Gene Wu from office, labeling him the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a contentious redistricting plan that would favor the GOP. Abbott argues that by leaving, the lawmakers have abandoned their office, while Democrats maintain they are fulfilling their constitutional duty to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map" and are using a legitimate procedural tool.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for illegally exporting millions of dollars' worth of high-end Nvidia AI chips to China. The individuals allegedly operated a company to ship sensitive technology, including the powerful H100 GPUs, without the required licenses, violating U.S. export controls designed to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors. The case highlights ongoing U.S. efforts to prevent the illicit transfer of critical technology and the methods used to circumvent these restrictions, such as transshipment through other countries.

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category in 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murder and a 4.5% overall reduction in violent crime. Property crime also fell, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a record 18.6% one-year decline, though the rate remains higher than pre-pandemic levels. While experts note the positive trend, they also point out that aggravated assaults are still stubbornly high and that hate crimes remain a significant issue, with many incidents going unreported.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the 2023 Titan submersible implosion has concluded that the tragedy, which claimed five lives, was preventable and resulted from multiple failures by its operator, OceanGate. The scathing 300-page report faults CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, for ignoring safety warnings, using an inadequately designed carbon fiber hull, and fostering a toxic work culture that prioritized profits over safety. The investigation found a lack of proper certification and maintenance, leading to recommendations for stronger oversight of the submersible industry.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court ruled that while the president could pause access to the asylum system, the government could not ignore other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This move effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims at the border, halting a key administration policy credited with a dramatic drop in illegal crossings.</p>
