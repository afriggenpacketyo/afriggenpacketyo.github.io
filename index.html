          <h2>Chicago Mayor Issues Executive Order to Counter Potential Federal Agent Deployment</h2>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to prevent the deputization of local police, demands the Trump administration stand down, and sets rules for federal agents, such as prohibiting masks and requiring body cameras. While largely symbolic, the city has indicated it will use all available legal tools, including lawsuits, to counter federal actions it deems unconstitutional.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is moving forward with a plan to rename the Department of Defense back to its historical title, the Department of War. President Trump has stated the change reflects a focus on offense rather than just defense, aligning with a restoration of what he terms traditional military values over "woke ideology." The original Department of War was established in 1789 and was renamed after World War II. The administration believes this rebranding better represents the military's purpose and history of victory.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation highlights the largely unregulated for-profit industry of "body brokers" in the United States, who acquire and dismember donated bodies to sell parts for medical research. Unlike the strictly controlled organ donation system, this trade operates in a legal gray area, leading to instances of exploitation and disrespectful handling of remains, as families are often misled about how their loved ones' bodies will be used. While proponents argue these brokers fill a critical need for medical and scientific advancement, critics call for stronger regulations to prevent abuses and ensure dignity for the deceased.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the UK's Department for Education reveals a strong link between school attendance in the first week of term and persistent absence throughout the year. Figures show that 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to improve student outcomes, as overall absence rates remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the potential deployment of military forces to Chicago by the Trump administration, labeling the idea an "invasion." Pritzker stated that the administration has not communicated with the state about any such plans and suggested the move has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The comments come amid reports that the Pentagon is drafting plans to send National Guard members to the city, following similar controversial deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A new investigation has concluded that legendary Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," likely killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged the scene to look like an ambush. For decades, it was believed she was killed by criminals targeting the sheriff. However, a re-examination of the case using modern forensic techniques revealed inconsistencies in Pusser's statements, evidence that Pauline was shot outside the car, and that Pusser's own wound was likely self-inflicted. Pusser died in a car crash in 1974.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries, declaring them illegal. The court found that the President cannot use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to unilaterally impose tariffs, as that power rests with Congress. The ruling puts levies on goods from over 60 countries on shaky ground, though it does not affect sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum or those imposed during his first term. The administration has stated it will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article synthesizes advice from doctors, psychologists, and educators on managing screen time for children at different developmental stages. The consensus recommends being screen-free until age three to allow for sensory exploration, followed by limited and supervised use in kindergarten and elementary school to foster imagination and social skills. While acknowledging the difficulty of restricting adolescents, experts stress the importance of open communication about online content and habits over strict time limits, and for parents to model healthy digital behavior.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could jeopardize the central bank's independence and harm the U.S. economy. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to higher inflation, a weaker dollar, and reduced foreign investment over the long term. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, she cautions that the damaging consequences would eventually follow. (not investment advice)</p>

The environmental agency, Natural Resources Wales, had cautioned that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm, but the residents felt they had no choice but to act.</p>
