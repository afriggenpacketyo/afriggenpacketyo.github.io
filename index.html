          <p>A significant explosion occurred at a chemical plant in China's Shandong province, specifically at Gaomi Youdao Chemical Co. located within an industrial park in Weifang. The blast was powerful enough to shatter windows in a storage warehouse over two miles away, and the incident resulted in thick plumes of black smoke being visible from a considerable distance. The company manufactures pesticides and medical chemicals and employs over 500 people. Rescue teams were immediately dispatched to the scene, and local fire officials deployed over 230 personnel; authorities have yet to release information regarding casualties as they continue to investigate the situation.</p>

          <p>British ministers are weighing the possibility of eliminating the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that while removing the cap could alleviate poverty, it would entail substantial costs. Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall are spearheading the Child Poverty Taskforce to develop a child poverty strategy, expected to be released in the autumn. The taskforce is considering all options, with Phillipson emphasizing that a Labour government would not have implemented the cap, given their different priorities.</p>

          <p>Ankit Panda, a leading nuclear security analyst, argues that the world has entered a new nuclear age marked by renewed tensions between superpowers, the rise of China as a nuclear power, the collapse of arms control treaties, and destabilizing technological advancements. The war in Ukraine vividly illustrates the dynamics of this era, with nuclear threats looming from the outset. Panda suggests that while nuclear deterrence induces caution, it's not perfectly safe due to the involvement of fallible human organizations. He also discusses the recent conflict between India and Pakistan as the first South Asian nuclear crisis of this new age, highlighting the increased risks of escalation and the potential for miscalculation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a pardon to Scott Jenkins, the former sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, who was convicted of fraud and bribery charges. Jenkins, a long-time supporter of Trump, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of accepting bribes in exchange for making businessmen law enforcement officers without proper training. Trump characterized Jenkins as a victim of an overzealous Justice Department and accused the judge of preventing Jenkins from presenting evidence in his defense. Jenkins had accepted bribes from eight people, including undercover FBI agents, to allow them to carry concealed firearms and avoid traffic tickets.</p>

          <p>A car-ramming incident occurred during the Liverpool F.C. Premier League title victory parade, injuring almost 50 people, including four children. The British police have stated that the incident is not being treated as terrorism and have arrested a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area, believed to be the driver. Video footage shows a dark-colored vehicle swerving into the crowd, leaving victims on the ground, and witnesses attempting to stop the vehicle.

The police's proactive communication aims to provide a true narrative and prevent the spread of false or harmful information.

          <p>Tesla experienced a significant decline in European sales during April, with a 49% year-on-year drop, even as overall electric car sales rose. This decline is attributed to ongoing reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political affiliations and increasing competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese manufacturers. The company's aging vehicle lineup and lack of new mass-market offerings also contribute to the sales slump. Simultaneously, European consumers are increasingly favoring hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment in which Tesla does not compete.</p>

          <p>China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall greenhouse gas emissions for the first time, even as energy demand and economic activity increased. This drop is largely due to the country's aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, outpacing electricity demand growth. The shift puts China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets, with a commitment to peaking emissions before 2030. However, the report also notes that this decline could be reversed if economic growth accelerates, and that China needs to address other greenhouse gases like HFC-23.</p>

          <p>A family from Solihull recounted their experience witnessing a car ramming incident during the Liverpool FC victory parade, where a vehicle struck pedestrians just yards away from where they were standing. The incident resulted in 27 people being taken to hospital, with two seriously injured, and police have arrested a 53-year-old man.
