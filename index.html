          <h2>China Addresses Economic Deflation by Urging Tighter Price Controls in Key Sectors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 02:22:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang is urging tighter price regulation, particularly in the electric vehicle industry, to combat fierce price wars that are contributing to deflationary pressures on the economy. During a high-level meeting, he called for improved cost oversight and greater self-discipline from automakers in setting prices, emphasizing technological innovation over destructive competition. This move comes as China's industrial profits have plunged and producer prices have slipped, indicating significant strain on businesses. Economists remain skeptical, noting that Beijing must balance curbing excess supply with the need to maintain growth and employment, making significant production cuts unlikely.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, surpassing market estimates and reaching a record high. The surge is attributed to sustained, robust demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Chips of 7-nanometer size or smaller, crucial for AI applications, accounted for 74% of the company's total wafer revenue. Despite the strong performance, TSMC faces potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies, a strengthening Taiwan dollar, and possible order reductions from the smartphone and PC sectors due to macroeconomic conditions.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a 2 trillion euro budget for the seven-year period beginning in 2028, featuring a significant fivefold increase in defense and space investment to 131 billion euros. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as a budget for modern realities, allocating about 35% to climate and biodiversity projects and tripling funds for migration management. The plan also includes 100 billion euros in support for Ukraine. To fund the budget without increasing member state contributions, the EU aims to generate new revenue streams, though the proposal faces hurdles as it requires unanimous approval from all member states.

          <p>For the first time in history, the British and Irish Lions will start an all-Scottish trio at fly-half and centers for their first Test match against Australia in Brisbane. Coach Andy Farrell has selected Finn Russell, Sione Tuipulotu, and Huw Jones for the key playmaking roles. The selection is notable as it marks the first time since 1896 that a Lions squad for a major Test series does not include a Welsh player in the matchday 23. The starting lineup is dominated by Irish players, with eight starters, while England contributes four starters to the team.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, Lee Zeldin argues that the Trump administration's efforts to reform the Environmental Protection Agency are crucial for American dominance in the AI revolution. He contends that easing regulations and streamlining the permitting process for data centers and power generation will remove barriers inherited from the previous administration. Zeldin asserts these changes will support the massive energy needs of AI development while ensuring human health and the environment are protected. The author claims these reforms will make the EPA a partner to industry rather than an impediment to progress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing internal backlash after Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration removed the party whip from four MPs and stripped three others of their trade envoy roles. The disciplinary action followed the MPs' decision to vote against the government on a key welfare bill. While Downing Street aims to project authority and deter future rebellions, some Labour MPs have described the move as "petty," "vindictive," and a sign of weakness. The timing has been questioned, with critics suggesting it could lower morale within the party just before Parliament's summer recess.</p>

As a patron of the Halo Trust, Harry walked through a partially cleared minefield and met with children who are taught how to avoid detonating the explosives that still litter the country after its civil war. The prince emphasized that children should not have to live in fear and highlighted the ongoing threat to civilians. The Halo Trust has cleared 120,000 landmines in Angola, but an estimated thousand minefields remain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources report she was dismissed under the president's constitutional authority, a move that is drawing scrutiny due to her father's contentious firing by President Trump in 2017. Maurene Comey was a prominent prosecutor involved in several high-profile cases, including those against Sean "Diddy" Combs and associates of Jeffrey Epstein, such as Ghislaine Maxwell. Her dismissal adds another layer to the fraught relationship between the Trump administration and the Comey family.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted by 0.5% in June, marking the second straight month of decline and raising fears of a potential recession for the export-dependent economy. The drop was worse than economists' expectations and comes as trade tensions with the U.S. intensify, with a 25% American tariff on Japanese imports set to take effect. Shipments to the U.S. fell by 11.4%, with auto exports plunging 26.7% as carmakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share. The data underscores the significant economic pressure Japan faces without a breakthrough in trade negotiations with the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data reveals that the majority of undocumented immigrants deported under the Trump administration do not have violent criminal records. Of the approximately 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, most of the documented infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. For instance, homicide convictions accounted for just 0.58% of the criminal deportees. This data, obtained by CBS News, appears to contrast with the administration's public messaging, which has consistently focused on prioritizing the removal of the "worst of the worst" violent offenders.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant market turmoil if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A research note from Wolfe Research predicts such a move would be "significantly negative for markets," likely causing an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The situation could lead to a legal battle, potentially decided by the Supreme Court, over whether the president has the authority to fire a Fed chair for cause. The speculation follows reports that Trump told Republican lawmakers he would likely fire Powell soon, a claim the president later publicly downplayed as "highly unlikely."

Subsequent investigation of CCTV footage revealed emotional and physical abuse of the children by at least six different nannies.
