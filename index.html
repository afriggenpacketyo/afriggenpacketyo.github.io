          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against President Trump's proclamation that blocks foreign students from attending the university, arguing that it violates the First Amendment and misuses federal law. The lawsuit claims that Trump's actions are a retaliatory measure against Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights. Trump's proclamation cites concerns about Harvard's trustworthiness, its entanglements with foreign countries, and alleged discriminatory admissions practices as justification for the ban. The university previously won a temporary order blocking the administration from revoking its ability to enroll international students, and this lawsuit represents an escalation in the ongoing feud between Harvard and the Trump administration. The optimism score is unrelated to any of the aforementioned information.</p>

          <p>A public feud has erupted between President Trump and Elon Musk, with Musk accusing Trump of "ingratitude" and alleging his involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Trump responded by criticizing Musk's stance on his "big, beautiful" megabill and claiming that Musk had gone "CRAZY." The feud escalated with Musk supporting calls for Trump's impeachment and criticizing his tariff policy, while Trump threatened to terminate Musk's government subsidies and contracts. The dispute originated from Musk's opposition to the Republican tax and budget bill, which he criticized as "outrageous" and an "abomination" due to its impact on the national debt. The public spat between the two figures has raised questions about the future of their relationship and the potential consequences for both parties.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk are engaged in a heated public dispute, with Musk alleging Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein and Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts. The feud began over Musk's criticism of the Republican's "big, beautiful bill," which includes tax cuts and spending measures, leading Musk to label it a "disgusting abomination." Trump expressed disappointment in Musk's criticism, claiming that Musk only opposed the bill after electric vehicle subsidies were removed, while Musk asserted that he was not consulted on the bill's details. The conflict escalated with Musk claiming he helped Trump win the election and Trump accusing Musk of being upset about the loss of tax credits for electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>BeyoncÃ©'s Cowboy Carter tour kicked off its London residency at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, showcasing her new country era with a visually stunning, three-hour performance. The show featured elaborate costumes, a gold mechanical bull, and homages to black performers who were historically excluded from the country music scene. Ticket sales were reportedly slow, with some fans feeling short-changed due to dynamic pricing strategies that saw prices slashed before the show. Despite the spectacle, some critics noted that the stadium setting might not be the best venue for a country-themed performance, while others suggested the setlist could have included more of her classic hits. The singer's performance was nonetheless a resounding success.</p>

Comer's inquiry has expanded to include scrutiny of Biden's mental acuity and his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election.

          <p>The Labour government in England will require developers to fit solar panels to the "vast majority" of new build homes, according to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. The regulations will be published later this year as part of the Future Homes Standard, with a transitional period for developers to adjust. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against "burdensome" paperwork that could hinder the construction of 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Miliband stated that the move is "just common sense" and will save households Â£500 a year on energy bills, with exemptions only for buildings covered by shade. This policy aims to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in new housing.</p>

The company's fiscal Q2 revenue increased by 20% year-over-year to $15 billion, exceeding expectations, and adjusted earnings per share also surpassed estimates. CEO Hock Tan anticipates continued robust growth in AI revenue into fiscal year 2026, driven by demand for custom AI chips and networking solutions. Despite a slight dip in after-hours trading, the analyst maintains a hold-equivalent rating but raises the price target to $290 per share, citing Broadcom's strong performance and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy.

The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against "any individual" based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex.
