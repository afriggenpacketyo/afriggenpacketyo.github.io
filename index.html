          <p>A Bogotá court convicted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe of bribery and witness tampering, marking the first time a former head of state in the country has been found guilty in a criminal case. The judge determined Uribe attempted to persuade a jailed ex-paramilitary member to lie about his alleged connections to right-wing paramilitary groups. The conviction, which could result in a sentence of up to 12 years, stems from a long-running and highly politicized investigation that began in 2012. The case highlights the enduring legacy of Colombia's armed conflict and remains a divisive issue within the nation.</p>

While this deal avoids a more severe trade conflict, some aspects are still under negotiation, and its legality remains under challenge in U.S. courts.

While he reached the correct conclusion that starvation is real, his reliance on TV over intelligence briefings makes him susceptible to manipulation and narrows his understanding of complex issues. This media-centric approach, particularly his focus on Fox News, has defined his political style but also raises concerns about governance in an age of potential misinformation and deepfakes. His trust in visual media shapes his response to events, from foreign policy to domestic matters.</p>

          <p>A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the wildfires in Los Angeles this past January resulted in $51.7 billion in damages to residential properties within the city limits. The analysis focused primarily on the 23,000-acre Palisades fire, which devastated wealthy neighborhoods and destroyed thousands of homes. The fire, one of the most destructive in state history, forced over 30,000 residents to evacuate. This estimate does not include damage to commercial properties or public infrastructure, suggesting the total economic impact is even higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A widespread and dangerous heatwave is gripping the eastern half of the U.S., putting more than 200 million people under heat alerts. The most extreme conditions are focused in the Southeast, where heat indices are forecast to reach between 105 and 120 degrees. Major cities from the Midwest to the Northeast are also experiencing sweltering temperatures, with little relief expected overnight. The prolonged heat poses a significant health risk, as cities like Tampa, Florida, have already broken all-time temperature records, and smoke from Canadian wildfires is exacerbating air quality issues in some areas.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government is defending a military spokesperson who claimed that images of starving Palestinians in Gaza are "fake" and distributed by Hamas. This position directly contradicts President Trump, who stated he believes the pictures depict "real starvation." The disagreement comes as international pressure on Israel intensifies, with two Israeli human rights groups now characterizing the military operation as a genocide. Israeli officials maintain that sufficient aid is entering Gaza but that UN agencies are failing to distribute it properly, a claim humanitarian workers dispute due to ongoing combat.</p>

          <p>An inquest has heard that Paloma Shemirani, a 23-year-old woman who died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, had refused chemotherapy treatment, telling a court she was "anti-vax." Her mother, a former nurse who shared conspiracy theories, has blamed doctors for her daughter's death. Paloma had instead opted for an unproven alternative diet therapy and had denied her cancer diagnosis, calling it an "absurd fantasy." The case highlights the tragic consequences of medical misinformation and the influence of family members on critical healthcare decisions, with the inquest examining the appropriateness of her care.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane in the central Pacific Ocean this year. Currently a Category 1 storm, Iona is located several hundred miles south-southeast of Honolulu but is not considered an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the storm to strengthen to Category 2 intensity before gradually weakening later in the week. The hurricane is projected to continue moving westward, staying well south of Hawaii, marking a notable development in the 2025 hurricane season.</p>

This development, along with a recent high-level meeting between the agency's director and a Boeing senior vice president, indicates that the American aerospace company could benefit significantly if a broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington is reached.

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers star Luka Doncic has undergone a significant physical transformation during the offseason, adopting a new gluten-free, low-sugar diet and a rigorous daily workout regimen in his home country of Croatia. The changes come after his mid-season trade from the Mavericks, which was reportedly motivated in part by frustrations over his conditioning. Now visibly slimmer and more toned, Doncic says he feels his "whole body looks better" and views this summer as just the beginning of a long-term commitment to his fitness. He aims to maintain his new habits throughout the upcoming NBA season.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian family seeking to flee the conflict in Gaza has won a key legal victory against the UK government. The High Court ruled that the foreign secretary must "think again" about whether to help the family of six, who have a British relative and are living in a tent at "constant risk." The family was granted permission to come to the UK but was denied assistance in leaving Gaza, as the Foreign Office's policy for such help is highly restrictive. The judge found the family's situation to be legally exceptional, compelling the government to reconsider its decision.</p>

The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU goods, was seen by many in the bloc as an unfavorable but necessary measure to avert a full-scale trade war with the Trump administration.

          <p>Economic experts suggest the new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is an "asymmetric and unbalanced deal" that will hurt the EU's economy. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a sharp increase from previous levels, while U.S. goods will face no new tariffs. The EU also committed to large purchases of U.S. energy. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturing, some economists believe the EU accepted unfavorable terms primarily to avoid the threatened alternative of a 30% tariff and a more severe trade war.
