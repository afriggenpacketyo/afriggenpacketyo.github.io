          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a 39% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong performance in its investment banking division. The bank's CEO, Christian Sewing, hailed the results as the best quarterly profit in fourteen years, putting the bank on track to meet its 2025 targets. However, the bank also increased its credit provisions, citing uncertainties in the geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. While analysts noted solid results, they also cautioned about mixed divisional trends and potential economic headwinds. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a comeback victory in the Canadian election, largely attributed to voter response against Donald Trump's antagonistic stance towards Canada. Trump's remarks about potentially integrating Canada into the U.S. fueled concerns about Canadian sovereignty and economic security, shifting voter sentiment in favor of the Liberals. Carney emphasized Canada's commitment to its independence and pledged to defend its interests against perceived American encroachment, while also expressing willingness to negotiate trade deals. This victory marks a significant shift in Canadian politics, highlighting the impact of international relations on domestic elections. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers, Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki, were released from prison after serving over four years on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.

          <p>Volvo Cars announced a $1.9 billion cost-cutting initiative in response to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter of the year. The company attributes the profit drop to decreased wholesales, adverse currency effects, and general turbulence in the automotive industry.

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower GDP and export growth compared to the rest of the country in the first quarter, with GDP growth at 5.2% versus the national average of 5.4%. Exports declined by 8.7% while China saw a 6.9% gain, attributed to firms rushing orders before U.S. tariffs took effect. Analysts suggest that Shenzhen's unique challenges, including a high baseline from previous growth and pressures from the trade war, contributed to this underperformance. The city faces rising costs, insufficient orders, and pressure on foreign trade, hindering its economic momentum. Optimism score: 50</p>

Additionally, the government proposes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies from 5g to 4g per 100ml.

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen an unprecedented use of executive orders, many of which have faced legal challenges and sparked debate over presidential power. These orders have restructured the U.S. government and altered foreign and domestic policies, often aligning with the ultraconservative Project 2025. While executive orders can be stopped or overturned by Congress, courts, or future presidents, their frequent use highlights the administration's reliance on executive action. The high number of legal challenges raises questions about the legality and long-term impact of these orders. Optimism score: 40</p>

Experts suggest expanding the platform to facilitate a Lifetime Pot model, allowing individuals to choose their pension provider regardless of employment. In the meantime, individuals can track down their pensions using the Governmentâs Pension Tracing Service and consider consolidating them, but should first consider exit penalties or loss of benefits.
