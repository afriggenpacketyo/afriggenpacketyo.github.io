Trump stated that America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders for too long, which is why Alcatraz will house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Leading Democrats criticized the proposal, while Alcatraz is currently a successful tourist site. The prison was originally a naval defense fort, and it was rebuilt in the early 20th Century as a military prison.</p>

          <p>China’s offshore yuan has surged to a six-month high, breaking past the 7.2 level against the US dollar, fueled by expectations of a potential rollback of tariffs. This shift in market sentiment is driven by hopes that the US and China will soon begin trade negotiations, potentially easing trade war tensions. However, analysts caution that these negotiations will be lengthy and uncertain, which could bring volatility to the exchange rate. Despite renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors remain cautious and await tangible signs of China's ability to withstand US challenges.</p>

This claim challenges the current recognition of the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece as the oldest. The researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the approximate years of observations. This finding suggests that detailed study of the night sky began in China around the same time as in Greece.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US has raised concerns in the Australian movie industry. The federal government has pledged to defend the Australian screen industry, which benefits from foreign productions due to incentives like the location offset scheme. The move could impact the attractiveness of Australia as a filming location and potentially affect the export of Australian content to the US market. The federal government's location offset scheme offers a 30% rebate for big-budget film projects shot in Australia, with additional post-production rebates, and state governments offering further sweeteners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing a threat to the American movie industry and national security. He argued that foreign incentives were drawing filmmakers away from the US, calling it a "concerted effort" by other nations. The announcement has caused uncertainty and concern within the global film industry, with governments and industry bodies in countries like Australia and New Zealand expressing support for their respective film sectors. The move could significantly impact the economics of film production and distribution.</p>

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to labor disputes and a debt crisis, forcing some pilots to work as food delivery drivers. The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs. The suspension is attributed to a lack of profitable routes, with high-speed rail networks providing cheaper alternatives. This situation underscores the challenges faced by regional airlines in competing with more affordable transportation options.</p>

          <p>The finance chiefs of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus Japan, China, and South Korea warned of the potential global economic fallout from protectionist trade policies, following the announcement of higher import tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The finance ministers and central bank governors said this in a statement adopted when they met on the sidelines of the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Milan, Italy.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers has revealed that the first roses were likely yellow. Roses are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, coming in an array of shapes, sizes and colours. The team said in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Plants on April 4 that as the most successfully domesticated ancient ornamental plants, roses have been regarded as a symbol of love and beauty from antiquity to modern times.</p>

          <p>The authors argue that China is at parity or pulling ahead of the United States in a variety of technologies, notably at the A.I. frontier. And it has developed a real edge in how it disseminates, commercializes and manufactures tech. History has shown us that those who adopt and diffuse a technology the fastest wins. China has chosen to forcefully retaliate against America’s recent tariffs. To win the race for the future of technology, and in turn the war for global leadership, we must discard the belief that America is always ahead.</p>
