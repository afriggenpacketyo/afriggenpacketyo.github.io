While the stock has doubled in price this year, it has faced challenges since the GameStop trading frenzy and the FTX collapse.

The ban applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while also imposing stricter regulations on individuals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The administration justified the ban following a terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, emphasizing the need for secure vetting and screening processes.

Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham, though confirmation of dialogue between the clubs is pending.

Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, with sources suggesting it would cost Tottenham over Â£10m to release him from his contract, which runs until 2027.</p>

This hybrid system combines analog and digital methods, reducing the risk of theft even if family members are held at gunpoint.

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard in response to escalating protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement operations. Demonstrations, which began Friday evening, continued through the weekend, resulting in clashes between protesters and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived lawlessness in California. Governor Gavin Newsom has requested the Trump administration rescind the deployment, arguing that the federal government is attempting to take over the California National Guard and that the move is inflammatory.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival has reduced its ticket sales by a few thousand this year in an effort to alleviate heavy crowds, according to organizer Emily Eavis. The sold-out event will not utilize its full 210,000 capacity, allowing organizers to assess the impact on site dynamics. The Other Stage, the festival's second-largest arena, has been expanded to accommodate larger audiences, particularly for Charli XCX's headline performance. Festival-goers are encouraged to use various routes and explore the entire site to reduce congestion, with organizers tracking popular artists through the festival app to predict busy areas.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill is launching Adobo Ranch, a new dipping sauce, on June 17, hoping to revitalize sales after a sluggish start to the year. The new menu item, Chipotle's first dip since queso blanco in 2020, is a spicier version of ranch made with adobo peppers, sour cream, and herbs and spices. The launch comes as Chipotle seeks to recover from its first same-store sales decline since 2020, attributed to consumers' economic concerns. The company hopes the 75-cent add-on will draw cautious diners back to its restaurants.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is increasing its efforts to plant more trees as a climate solution to combat rising temperatures. With record highs contributing to numerous deaths last summer, the city, county, and nonprofits are focusing on planting trees in the hottest neighborhoods.

The effort addresses "shade disparity," as lower-income neighborhoods often lack tree canopy and face disproportionately higher temperatures, improving the long-term viability of the communities.</p>

Additionally, it imposes lifetime borrowing caps, potentially hindering students in professional programs like medical school.
