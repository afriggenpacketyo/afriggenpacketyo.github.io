          <p>Bill Gates announced in a CBS Mornings interview that he plans to give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's essay "The Gospel of Wealth." Gates' net worth, currently at $108 billion, is expected to decrease by 99% as the funds are directed towards saving and improving lives, aiming to prevent deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicate infectious diseases, and enhance education. Gates expressed concern that Trump administration aid cuts could stall progress, potentially increasing childhood deaths, while praising global health initiatives from former President George W. Bush.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has committed to spending $200 billion through the Gates Foundation before it closes in 2045, focusing on preventing preventable deaths, eradicating infectious diseases, and alleviating poverty. Gates believes progress in these areas will be "incredible" in the next 20 years, citing breakthroughs in HIV and tuberculosis research. However, he anticipates an increase in childhood mortality due to Trump administration cuts to foreign aid. Gates also highlighted the potential of A.I. to improve healthcare delivery and access to tools in developing countries.</p>

He acknowledged the challenges posed by the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid, which could lead to millions of additional childhood deaths, and emphasized the importance of innovation, including A.I., in driving down health costs and relieving scarcity.</p>

          <p>The European Union announced plans to increase pressure on the United States, potentially imposing tariffs on $107 billion worth of American goods in response to duties announced or imposed by the Trump administration.

          <p>Denmark is holding its first trial under a new law criminalizing the "inappropriate treatment" of religious scriptures, following a case where two men allegedly burned a Quran at a folk festival in June 2024. The law, enacted in December 2023, aims to prevent provocative acts that triggered international tension and diplomatic incidents. Critics argue the law curtails freedom of expression, while supporters claim it strengthens national security. Similar debates have occurred in Sweden, where Quran burnings are not illegal, highlighting ongoing tensions between freedom of expression and religious sensitivity.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that Bryan Kohberger's immediate family members can attend his upcoming quadruple-murder trial, even if they are potential witnesses. Kohberger is charged with the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students in November 2022 and faces four counts of first-degree murder, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty. The judge balanced Kohberger's right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony, noting that the family's testimony is narrow and previously recorded, mitigating the risk of altered statements.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing an increasingly significant role in American family life, driven by demographic shifts, longer life expectancies, and the need for affordable childcare. As birth rates fall, grandparents have fewer grandchildren to care for, allowing them to spend more quality time with each child. They are also increasingly stepping in to provide childcare, offering benefits to both children and parents, but policymakers should support reforms that enable grandparents to spend time with their grandchildren by choice, not necessity.</p>

          <p>BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty is speaking out against medical misogyny, revealing that she endured decades of extreme pain due to adenomyosis, a condition that was dismissed by doctors for years. Munchetty's new book, "It's Probably Nothing," explores the systemic failure of doctors to take women's symptoms seriously. She hopes to empower women to push for diagnosis and treatment, and is calling for more UK clinical trials to focus on women's health issues.</p>

          <p>Despite international diplomatic efforts, tensions between India and Pakistan remain volatile, with reports of heavy shelling and strikes on both sides.

The recent escalation follows a terror attack in Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement. Both countries maintain a united front domestically, but the risk of further escalation remains high.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are raising prices on various goods, leading to discussions about American consumer culture and the availability of cheap products. An interview with doll manufacturer Elenor Mak highlights the challenges faced by small businesses due to increased costs, while economist Martha Gimbel projects a significant increase in household expenses. The article explores the potential impact of tariffs on consumer habits and the broader economy, contrasting the nostalgia for manufacturing with the realities of a service-based economy.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to announce a trade agreement with the United States, marking a significant political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer and underscoring the enduring "special relationship" between the two countries. The deal, details of which are still emerging, aims to mitigate the impact of recent U.S. tariff increases, but could face scrutiny regarding agricultural imports and alignment with European Union trade relations. This agreement could also boost confidence in the British economy, which has struggled with faltering growth and strained public finances.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and UK could provide a welcome boost for the British economy, but faces limitations in addressing broader economic challenges. While the agreement may support sectors like the auto industry and lift consumer sentiment, its impact is limited by the dominance of services in trade flows and the greater importance of the relationship with the European Union. As the Bank of England cuts interest rates, economists emphasize that the larger threat to Britain stems from global trade uncertainty rather than tariffs on Britain itself.</p>
