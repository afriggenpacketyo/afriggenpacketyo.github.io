Scott McLaughlin, Scott Dixon, and Marco Andretti were among those involved in early incidents, while Alexander Rossi's car caught fire during a pit stop. Josef Newgarden made a significant climb through the field after starting in the last row.

Ukrainian forces claimed to have shot down a majority of the incoming weapons, but the sheer scale of the barrage strained the country's defenses. The strikes underscore the failure of cease-fire negotiations to de-escalate the conflict, with civilian deaths rising in recent months.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, asserting they have a "moral component" and address fraud within the system. Johnson claims that able-bodied individuals who refuse to work are defrauding the system and that putting them to work benefits both themselves and their communities. He insisted that the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP but focuses on eliminating waste and abuse. The bill faces opposition in the Senate, with some Republicans expressing concerns about the impact on low-income individuals. Johnson emphasized that the requirements are not overly burdensome, requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week through various means.</p>

          <p>Federal judges are contemplating establishing their own armed security force, shifting control from the Department of Justice, due to increasing concerns about their safety and potential political interference. The proposal arose during a meeting where judges voiced anxieties that the Trump administration might compromise their protection. Under the current system, the U.S. Marshals Service, managed by the Justice Department, safeguards federal judges. Some judges fear the administration could withdraw security from those ruling against it. The move aims to ensure judicial independence and protect judges from intimidation amid heightened political tensions and threats.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order has amplified concerns regarding the expansion of presidential authority under President Trump, as the court quietly endorsed some of his firings of high-level officials. The decision, made in a case involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, effectively allows the president to neutralize independent expertise within the executive branch. The court's action overrules a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, granting the president underspecified but considerable new authority. Critics argue this decision emboldens the president to act outside the traditional constitutional order and undermines the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A Republican senator indicated that President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" faces significant resistance in the Senate, potentially halting its progress unless substantial changes are made. Senator Ron Johnson voiced concerns that the bill increases the deficit and called for deeper spending cuts. The bill, which narrowly passed the House, relies on reconciliation, requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. However, changes in the Senate would necessitate another House vote, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Johnson emphasized the need for a more thorough process to address spending and the deficit, while Senator Rand Paul opposes the bill due to its debt ceiling increase.</p>

          <p>A Georgia police officer resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and facing deportation. The officer, Leslie O’Neal, pulled over Ximena Arias-Cristobal for an alleged traffic violation, which was later dropped. Arias-Cristobal, brought to the U.S. as a child, was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody, sparking public outcry. The incident highlights the consequences of local law enforcement collaboration with Ice and the impact of strict immigration policies. Arias-Cristobal was eventually released on bond, and her attorney is working to secure her permanent residency.</p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer on the film "Rust", has been released from prison after serving 14 months for involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Gutierrez was found guilty of reckless handling of firearms and ammunition, though she denied bringing live bullets to the set. Alec Baldwin, who also faced charges, had his case dismissed. The criminal phase of the "Rust" saga has concluded with Gutierrez's release, though civil lawsuits remain. The incident has heightened awareness of film set safety, particularly on low-budget productions, and prompted scrutiny of inexperienced crew members.</p>

          <p>Rwanda's President Paul Kagame launched a military intervention in eastern Congo by backing M23 rebels, seizing Goma in a brazen assault. This move drew international condemnation, as Kagame has long denied sponsoring M23 despite UN and US claims. Western leaders, previously overlooking Kagame's abuses due to Rwanda's development and security contributions, now face a dilemma. The invasion may be linked to mineral greed and shifting power dynamics in the region, particularly Uganda's road deal with Congo. The conflict's future hinges on Trump's response, with a potential peace deal in the works.</p>

          <p>Japan, a leading public financier of fossil fuels, is under scrutiny for its significant investments in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, totaling $56 billion between 2013 and 2024.

Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" and its use of loopholes, such as carbon capture storage (CCS), constitute greenwashing.

This approach focuses on creating a safe space for children to express big emotions without judgment, viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents set boundaries with empathy, prevent shame, and prioritize open communication.

          <p>Germany's finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, has joined calls for talks with the US after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe starting next week. Klingbeil warned that the US tariffs endanger both the US and European economies. The EU's trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, stated the bloc is committed to a deal that works for both sides. The Irish premier, Micheál Martin, cautioned about the disruptive consequences of such high tariffs on the global economy. The threat of increased tariffs has sent stock markets into turmoil and weakened the US dollar.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent embrace of the new Syrian leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region, leading to a decrease in Israeli airstrikes on Syria. Israel, concerned about the new government's ties to extremist groups and the potential for weapon proliferation, had launched numerous attacks since the change in power. However, Trump's meeting with the Syrian leader and subsequent lifting of sanctions have undercut Israel's efforts. The situation highlights the shifting dynamics in the Middle East and the challenges Israel faces in navigating its security interests amidst changing US foreign policy.</p>
