          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is facing harsh criticism from opposition lawmakers following a speech where he likened the nation's democratic progress to forging steel by removing "impurities." Opponents, particularly from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, interpret this language as a veiled threat to eliminate political dissent. They connect his remarks to an upcoming effort by his Democratic Progressive Party to recall dozens of KMT legislators, warning that this rhetoric echoes authoritarian ideological purity and represents a move toward a "dictatorship" that the public should reject.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant monthly decline since last October and signaling that government stimulus efforts are failing to boost corporate profitability. This data follows other mixed economic indicators, including strong retail sales but weaker industrial output. Despite the downturn, some economists believe Beijing may delay further stimulus, as overall GDP growth for the first half of the year is tracking above the official 5% target, potentially reducing the urgency for immediate intervention.

A White House spokeswoman noted that the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is possible, a sentiment previously echoed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Japan is particularly concerned about the administration's steep tariffs on imported passenger vehicles, which were raised to 27.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Defence Ministry has issued a stern warning to the Philippines, cautioning it against "self-inflicted destruction" for agreeing to host U.S. missile systems. A ministry spokesman stated that by introducing these strategic weapons, Manila is binding itself to the "U.S. war machine," which undermines regional security and stability. The warning comes after the U.S. Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) was used in recent joint military exercises. The Philippine military has defended the presence of the missiles as a necessary "deterrent against coercion," escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump made a final pitch for his major tax-and-spending bill, but notably omitted any mention of his previous July 4 deadline for its passage, suggesting potential delays in the Senate. The bill, which includes new tax cuts and funding for immigration enforcement, is highly controversial. Democrats have strongly opposed the legislation, pointing to its proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which they argue would harm millions of Americans. Trump promoted the bill to an audience of supporters, claiming it contains "hundreds of things" that are beneficial.</p>

          <p>A classified intelligence briefing on the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities has left senators sharply divided along partisan lines regarding the mission's success. Republican allies of President Trump, like Senator Lindsey Graham, supported the administration's claim that the sites were "obliterated," setting back Iran's program by years. However, Democrats like Senator Chris Murphy accused the president of "misleading the public," arguing that significant capabilities remain and the setback is likely a matter of months. The differing interpretations highlight ongoing disputes within the government over the true impact of the unauthorized military action.</p>

The project, led by GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter, heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. Research shows that such interventions can reduce peak urban temperatures significantly as climate change intensifies heat waves. This urban laboratory, which partners with the city and Boston University researchers, could provide a valuable template for other densely populated cities looking to mitigate extreme heat and improve livability.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is struggling to meet the government's key priority of reducing hospital waiting times, with the 18-week target remaining unmet since 2015. A BBC Verify analysis reveals that over a third of hospital trusts have seen their performance worsen since a new improvement plan was announced in January. While the government notes that waiting times have improved slightly during the winter for the first time in a decade, patient groups and doctors express skepticism about achieving the ambitious goals. They warn that delayed operations leave patients in pain and at risk of deteriorating health.</p>

          <p>Business owners across the U.S. are expressing concern that the Trump administration's expanding crackdown on immigration is threatening a critical supply of workers. With immigrants making up a record high of nearly one in five U.S. workers, industries from cleaning services to healthcare and construction report losing employees and facing labor shortages. The administration's efforts have broadened beyond targeting those in the country illegally to revoking temporary work permits for long-term residents. Economists warn that these policies could slow economic growth, limit business expansion, and potentially fuel inflation by making it harder to fill jobs.</p>
