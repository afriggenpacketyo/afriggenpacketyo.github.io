          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 22:28:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is attributed to the robust and sustained demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial components in artificial intelligence technologies for clients like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventories and anticipating further growth from new product launches and continued AI investments by major tech firms. This performance has intensified its competition with rival Samsung for dominance in the global memory market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has refuted media reports claiming President Donald Trump's name is mentioned in Justice Department files concerning the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson dismissed the claims as a continuation of politically motivated "fake news stories." The statement came as a Florida judge denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury records from a 2006 investigation into Epstein, citing state secrecy laws. While being named in the documents does not imply wrongdoing, the administration is facing pressure to increase transparency regarding the case, a promise Trump made during his campaign.</p>

          <p>The iconic Mexican group Los Bukis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an honor they dedicated to the immigrant community in the United States. During the ceremony, frontman Marco Antonio Solís delivered an emotional speech, calling immigrants a "silent service force" that contributes immensely to the country. He offered words of support during what he described as "times of adversity," expressing hope for a swift and positive resolution to their challenges. The event, celebrated by figures like actor Demián Bichir, marked a significant milestone, with Solís becoming the only Hispanic artist to have two separate stars on the famous boulevard.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified additional documents related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, claiming they reveal that Obama administration officials fabricated intelligence to undermine Donald Trump's candidacy. The release, which includes a 2017 House GOP report, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and former intelligence officials. They argue the disclosure irresponsibly risks exposing sensitive intelligence sources and methods used to monitor Russia. Critics also noted the timing of the release, suggesting it is an attempt to distract from other political issues, while the administration maintains it is an act of transparency.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals panel has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 9th Circuit judges found that the policy contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The decision upholds a lower court's block on the order, which sought to deny automatic citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas. The White House has stated its disagreement with the ruling and intends to appeal, setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court review on the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne at 76, this article reflects on how he and his band, Black Sabbath, pioneered the heavy metal genre. The band formed as a reaction against the prevalent "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s, aiming to create a sound that was darker and heavier. A key element was guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, which he developed after an industrial accident and which became the foundation of the genre's signature sound. Despite initial critical dismissal and controversy over their supposedly satanic themes, Black Sabbath's music, from "Paranoid" to "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath," established a lasting and influential legacy in rock history.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants player Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts sharply with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about exclusively handling DH duties following a public disagreement with the team's management over a potential position change. His debut at first base for the Giants coincided with a decisive 9-0 victory for his new team against the Atlanta Braves.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber has defended the league's policy prohibiting political signage at games, a stance that has drawn criticism amid fan protests against U.S. immigration enforcement. Garber stated the rule is intended to keep stadiums safe and avoid inciting conflict, though he acknowledged that individual teams are permitted to make their own political statements. The defense comes as supporters' groups for several teams, including in Los Angeles and Austin, have displayed anti-ICE banners, arguing that the current immigration climate makes them feel unsafe.

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to stop a federal plan to kill approximately 450,000 barred owls over 30 years in the Pacific Northwest. The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is intended to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. Citing the high cost and inhumanity of the culling, the resolution's sponsors are using the Congressional Review Act to try and reverse the rule. However, some conservationists and scientists warn that halting the plan would likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

However, city officials have raised alarms, warning that the loss of revenue would be an "assault on public safety" and could force drastic cuts to police and fire departments.

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, surpassing expectations and allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. Despite the positive quarter, economists express caution for the future, as domestic demand remains sluggish and the externally facing sectors could struggle under the threat of new trade policies. The outcome may influence the Bank of Korea's future decisions regarding interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months into the new administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track for its highest number of annual deportations since 2014, with nearly 150,000 recorded so far. While this represents a significant increase in enforcement, the projected total of over 300,000 for the year remains far below the administration's ambitious goal of one million annual deportations. The figures highlight the operational and legal challenges of mass removal efforts, even with a sweeping mandate and increased funding. ICE's operations have expanded to include non-criminals, drawing strong condemnation from Democrats and sparking protests across the country.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Riverside County have confirmed that a fatal overdose in March was caused by carfentanil, a synthetic opioid considered 100 times more potent than fentanyl. The substance, a powerful anesthetic for large animals like elephants, has been appearing in illicit drug markets, and its reemergence poses a significant threat to public health. Deaths involving carfentanil are on the rise nationally, and its high potency means it can be lethal in minuscule amounts and may not be detected by standard fentanyl test strips. Officials are urging the public to carry naloxone and avoid using any unknown substances.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, which passed with bipartisan support, seeks to compel the release of materials that Republican leadership has been hesitant to pursue through other measures. The vote reflects growing pressure for transparency following a recent DOJ review that asserted Epstein had no incriminating "client list." The committee also approved subpoenas for several high-profile figures, including former presidents and attorneys general, as part of its inquiry into the handling of the case.</p>

The agreement includes a $200 million payment to settle antisemitism probes and an additional $21 million for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations. This resolution will reinstate the vast majority of the $400 million in federal research grants that were frozen by the administration, which had accused the university of failing to address antisemitism on campus.

An increase in the number of houses for sale, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, is creating more inventory. However, median home prices continue to hit record highs, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low interest rates to sell. Real estate experts advise prospective buyers to look for properties that have been on the market longer, as owners may be more willing to negotiate, and to explore first-time homebuyer programs to improve their chances.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic frames the Trump administration's new AI Action Plan as a significant bet on the private sector, effectively placing the nation's technological future in the hands of Silicon Valley. The plan, which prioritizes deregulation and rapid infrastructure development, closely mirrors the policy recommendations of major tech firms like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. By removing regulatory roadblocks, the administration aims to accelerate innovation and achieve global dominance, particularly over China. However, this approach also risks hastening a potential market bust if AI technology proves to be a bubble, while sidelining environmental and ethical concerns for corporate goals.</p>

The fund was established in 2019 to protect utility customers and prevent utility bankruptcies if their equipment is found to have caused a wildfire. With insured loss estimates for the Eaton fire ranging up to $15.2 billion, the fund's financial health is under strain, especially if investigators determine that Southern California Edison's equipment was responsible. The situation is complicated by ongoing lawsuits and concerns that a significant portion of the fund could go to third-party hedge funds and attorney fees.</p>
