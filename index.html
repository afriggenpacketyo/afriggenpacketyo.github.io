          <p>Former Congressman George Santos was sentenced to over seven years in prison for federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors stated that Santos fabricated his background to defraud voters and donors in New York's 3rd Congressional District, presenting false financial disclosures and even forging a Baruch College diploma. Santos admitted to betraying his supporters and the institutions he was sworn to serve, expressing remorse through tears, while prosecutors highlighted his lack of genuine repentance. He was expelled from Congress and ordered to pay over $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture. Optimism in this case is low as it reflects a betrayal of public trust and a breakdown of ethical conduct in politics.</p>

          <p>SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated that innovation in the crypto industry has been stifled and that changes are needed to foster growth. Speaking at a Crypto Task Force roundtable, Atkins expressed openness to reassessing crypto-related rules, suggesting a shift from an adversarial to a collaborative regulatory approach. The crypto industry played a significant role in President Trump's election victory, contributing financially to his campaign and supporting crypto-friendly congressional candidates. This signals a potential change in regulatory strategy towards the cryptocurrency sector.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement after allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE agents.

Dugan's attorney expressed her client's regret and protested the arrest, stating it was not in the interest of public safety.

          <p>The U.S. dollar is on track for its worst performance during the first 100 days of a presidency since the Nixon era, with the dollar index losing about 9% since President Trump's return to the White House. Trump's tariff policies and rhetoric against trading partners have led investors to seek assets outside the U.S., weakening the dollar and strengthening other currencies. Analysts suggest this shift reflects eroding trust in U.S. institutions and a potential structural change in global asset allocation trends. UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG have cut their dollar forecasts, citing the U.S.-China trade standoff and a potential structural downtrend for the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

Majorities view the early months of his administration as "chaotic" and "scary," and many do not believe he understands their daily struggles. Trump's approval rating stands at 42%, historically low for this stage in a presidency, and confidence in his handling of the economy and immigration has declined.

          <p>Amazon sellers have increased prices on nearly 1,000 products due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with an average price hike of nearly 30%. The price increases span a range of items, including tech accessories and women's clothing. Other e-commerce players like Shein and Temu have also raised prices after the U.S. closed a loophole allowing duty-free entry for goods under $800. The tariff policies are making it challenging for retailers to navigate costs and plan for the future. </p>

While ruling out general taxation, she has kept the possibility of a subscription model open.

          <p>Democrats are divided over how to respond to President Trump's immigration policies, particularly the deportation of undocumented immigrants. Some believe the party should highlight the lawless cruelty of Trump's actions, while others fear it plays into Trump's strengths and reinforces the narrative that Democrats prioritize foreigners over Americans. The debate centers on whether to focus on the due process rights of the undocumented or to shift the focus to Trump's economic mismanagement. The NRCC has already launched attacks on Democrats who have taken a high-profile stance on immigration.</p>
