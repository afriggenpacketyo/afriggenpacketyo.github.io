          <p>Prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing face challenges due to high mortgage rates and limited housing inventory, though strong credit can still secure favorable terms. As of September 15, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are 6.53%, with 15-year rates at 5.71%, while refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts suggest the Federal Reserve's potential pause on rate hikes could offer some relief, but borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles and compare lenders to find the best options. This article provides a snapshot of the current market, emphasizing strategic steps for securing competitive rates in a fluctuating economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation and libel lawsuit against The New York Times in Florida, accusing the newspaper of being a "mouthpiece" for the Democratic Party and making false statements about him, his family, and business. This action follows previous threats related to the Times' reporting on a sexually aggressive note purportedly given to Jeffrey Epstein, which the White House denies as a fabrication. A spokesperson for the Times asserted that the lawsuit lacks legitimate legal claims and is an attempt to discourage independent reporting, affirming their commitment to pursuing facts without fear. This legal challenge is part of a broader pattern of defamation suits Trump has initiated against media companies, alleging false or misleading coverage.</p>

          <p>State terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the individual accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, were dismissed by a New York City judge during a pre-trial hearing. The judge ruled the terrorism charges "legally insufficient," stating there was no evidence of intent to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence. Mangione still faces nine other state counts, including second-degree murder and eight weapons-related charges, which could lead to a sentence of 25 years to life if convicted. This decision significantly alters the state prosecution, though federal charges, potentially carrying the death penalty, are still active.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced a $5 billion investment to construct a new manufacturing facility in Goochland County, Virginia, aimed at significantly boosting its production capacity for targeted cancer drugs and other advanced treatments. This facility represents the first of four new U.S. manufacturing plants planned by the drugmaker, part of a broader $27 billion investment since 2020 to enhance domestic production. The site will focus on developing active ingredients for bioconjugate and monoclonal antibody drugs, including antibody drug conjugates used in cancer and autoimmune conditions. CEO Dave Ricks indicated the decision was influenced by favorable U.S. tax policies and the company's expanding pipeline, signaling a strategic shift of some production from Europe.</p>

          <p>China's recently launched Global Governance Initiative (GGI), unveiled at the UN's 80th anniversary, represents its most comprehensive vision for reshaping the international system. Experts view the initiative as an attempt to foster a multipolar world where developing nations gain greater influence, contrasting sharply with former President Trump's transactional diplomacy and unilateral measures. The GGI emphasizes inclusive multilateralism, sovereign equality, and development without ideological conditions, reflecting China's ambition to fill a perceived void as U.S.-led multilateralism faces increasing scrutiny.

Four out of seven EVs, including the BMW i4 and Tesla Cybertruck, earned "good" ratings in simulated head-on collisions. However, the Nissan Ariya received a "marginal" rating due to high risk of chest injuries for rear passengers, and the Ford F-150 Lightning scored "poor" for similar reasons, with concerns about seatbelt positioning.

          <p>U.S. Navy Reserve Ensign Eugene E. Mandeberg, 23, who died on V-J Day (August 15, 1945) when his formation engaged enemy planes over Tokyo, has finally been accounted for. His remains, initially interred as an "unknown" in the Manila American Cemetery, were exhumed in 2019 and identified using dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis. Mandeberg was listed as missing in action after his aircraft failed to return from a mission, and his family had held onto hope for his survival. His identification and burial in Livonia, Michigan, provide closure for his family decades after the war's official end.</p>

          <p>Savers with maturing Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts face a new landscape, as once-common 5% yields have declined to mid-4% ranges, with further cuts expected from the Federal Reserve. Most banks automatically roll over maturing CDs into new terms at current, lower rates if no action is taken during the grace period. Financial experts advise savers to actively compare current market options, as higher yields might be available elsewhere, or consider alternative investments like high-yield savings accounts or Treasury bills.

Corporate executives, including McDonald's CEO, observe a "two-tier economy" where middle and lower-income consumers feel significant pressure.
