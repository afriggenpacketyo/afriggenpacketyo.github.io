          <p>A growing number of Gen Z consumers are rejecting mass-produced, disposable "fast furniture" in favor of secondhand items, driven by environmental awareness and a desire for unique pieces with history. This trend pushes back against an industry where millions of tons of furniture, often made from non-recyclable composite materials, end up in landfills annually. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace are seeing a surge in use as younger buyers seek sustainability, affordability, and a more personal connection to their home decor, viewing the restoration of old items as an investment in their personal story.</p>

          <p>This article explains that a U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress and the president fail to approve new budget funds, causing large parts of the federal administration to temporarily cease operations. Based on the Antideficiency Act of 1884, this halt affects hundreds of thousands of federal employees who are furloughed without pay and can close public institutions like national parks. The current shutdown stems from a political impasse between Republicans and Democrats over funding for healthcare policies, including the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid.</p>

Recent public filings have confirmed that Berkshire has continued to increase its holdings, with its stakes in both Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10% ownership of each company.

          <p>In ongoing ceasefire negotiations, Hamas is insisting that Israel include several prominent Palestinian figures, such as Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat, in a planned prisoner exchange. Israel's initially published list of 250 prisoners to be freed did not include these high-profile names, who are widely viewed by Palestinians as important symbols of their resistance movement. This demand has become a potential sticking point in the delicate U.S.-brokered deal, which also involves the return of Israeli hostages being held in the Gaza Strip.</p>

In a speech, Kim lauded North Korean soldiers who were sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine and called for his military to become an "invincible entity that destroys all threats."</p>

          <p>A proposal from the U.S. Department of Transportation could prohibit Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace on flights to and from the United States, a move that would likely increase their operational costs. U.S. officials claim that access to Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair competitive advantage due to shorter flight times. If the ban is enacted, analysts predict Chinese airlines will be forced to either absorb the higher fuel costs of re-routing, raise ticket prices, or potentially cancel the affected routes entirely.</p>

If the party wins the next Senedd election, it plans to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000. The program would focus on priority subjects like math and science, as well as Welsh-medium teaching, and would require recipients to work in Wales for five years, with the goal of matching similar financial incentives offered in England by 2030.</p>

The defense is specifically challenging the count that makes Mangione eligible for the death penalty, arguing it is improperly applied. Additionally, they are seeking to suppress statements he made to law enforcement, alleging he was not read his Miranda rights, and to exclude evidence found in his backpack, which they claim was searched without a warrant.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's consistent and highly visible presence at combat sports events, such as UFC fights and professional wrestling, as a core element of his political branding. The author contends that Trump strategically aligns himself with the aggressive, anti-establishment ethos of these sports to project an image of a dominant, rule-breaking fighter, which strongly resonates with his political base. This "MAGA-fication of sports" is presented not just as a cultural phenomenon but as a deliberate effort to normalize a more brutish and confrontational style in the political arena.</p>
