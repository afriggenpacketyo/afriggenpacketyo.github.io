          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to over seven years in prison for federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors by fabricating his background and misusing campaign funds for personal enrichment. The judge highlighted Santos' lack of remorse during the sentencing. Santos, in a statement, claimed the sentence was politically influenced and requested a pardon from President Trump, while prosecutors emphasized that his actions undermined the electoral process and democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China's control over critical mineral exports poses a significant threat to the United States' military supply chain. The study identifies that a substantial portion of U.S. weapons systems rely on minerals dominated by China, such as antimony, gallium, and germanium. China's export restrictions on these materials could severely impact the manufacturing of military equipment. The report underscores the U.S.'s dependence on China for essential components despite efforts to diversify supply chains.</p>

          <p>Airlines are reporting weaker-than-expected domestic travel demand, leading to cuts in capacity growth plans and lower airfares. Factors contributing to the decline include economic uncertainty, volatile markets, and concerns about tariffs. Slower growth in corporate and government travel is also impacting airline revenue. Cheaper plane tickets may result as airlines cut prices to fill seats, although demand for premium travel remains strong.</p>

          <p>Yemeni coffee houses are experiencing growing popularity in the U.S., offering unique coffee drinks and pastries rooted in Yemen's rich coffee history. However, rising coffee prices due to climate change and the ongoing conflict in Yemen pose challenges to the industry. New U.S. policies designating the Houthi rebels as a terrorist organization could also affect the import of Yemeni coffee. Despite these obstacles, Yemeni coffee entrepreneurs remain committed to sharing their culture and providing economic support to farmers in Yemen.</p>
