          <p>Dame Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative MP who defected to Reform UK, has been elected as the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, marking a significant victory for her new party. Jenkyns, who previously worked at Greggs, secured a substantial win over the Conservative candidate, gaining control of a £24 million annual budget and powers over skills, transport, and economic development in the region. This win represents a remarkable political comeback for Jenkyns, who lost her seat in the general election less than a year prior. Her victory speech emphasized a "new dawn in British politics" and Reform's commitment to restoring Britain to its "glorious past."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK candidate Sarah Pochin won the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by a mere six votes, marking a significant win against the Labour Party, especially given the seat's previous Labour stronghold. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP, Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent. Nigel Farage celebrated the victory as evidence that Reform UK is now the primary opposition to the Labour government, while a Labour spokesperson acknowledged the difficulty of by-elections for governing parties, attributing the loss to voter frustration with the current state of the country after years of Conservative rule. The Conservative vote share collapsed, placing them a distant third in the race.</p>

          <p>Apple is moving the majority of its iPhone production for the U.S. market from China to India, with Vietnam becoming a major hub for iPads and Apple Watches, according to CEO Tim Cook. This shift is a response to President Trump's tariffs, which could increase Apple's costs by an estimated $900 million this quarter. While China will remain the primary country of origin for products sold outside the U.S., this strategic move aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions and align with the Trump administration's push for companies to manufacture more in America. Despite these changes, Apple reported a 5% increase in revenues for the first three months of the year.</p>

          <p>British oil giant Shell reported adjusted earnings of $5.58 billion for the first quarter, exceeding analyst expectations, and announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program to be completed over the next three months. CEO Wael Sawan described the earnings as a "solid set of results," highlighting the company's strong performance and resilient balance sheet. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks for the company. Shell's results come as Big Oil profits decline from record highs in 2022, influenced by a weak outlook for oil markets, falling crude prices, and volatile trade policies.</p>

          <p>Ed Martin Jr., President Trump's nominee for top federal prosecutor in Washington D.C., is facing significant opposition due to his conservative activism and limited legal experience. Martin has defended individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot and has appeared on Russian state media to echo Trump's talking points. His nomination is being challenged by Democrats and faces skepticism from some Republicans, leading to calls for a rare hearing to grill him on his record. Critics argue that Martin lacks the necessary experience and has abused his office to intimidate potential targets of investigations, while supporters tout his commitment to conservative causes and his initiative to combat violent crime in D.C.</p>

The film's release follows legal battles and controversy, with some criticizing the premiere as insensitive. The documentary "Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna" was released earlier this year, focusing on Hutchins' life and career and the emotional toll her death took on her family. Baldwin, who was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter, has filed a lawsuit against prosecutors, while Hutchins' widower reached a settlement with the film's producers and became an executive producer.</p>

Early clinical data suggests comparable weight reduction to GLP-1s, with potentially better tolerability and lean muscle preservation.

          <p>The UK's participation in a US military operation against Houthi rebels in Yemen has intensified, raising concerns about civilian casualties. The RAF operation targeted a plant manufacturing armed drones, demonstrating the UK's close military alliance with the Trump administration. Reports indicate high civilian casualties, including a US attack that killed nearly 70 African migrants. The UK's Akrotiri base in Cyprus is linked to the US war against the Houthis and serves as a hub for supporting Israel in the Gaza war, raising ethical and political questions about the UK's involvement in controversial conflicts.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a move likely to have significant socio-economic and political consequences. The decision demonstrates New Delhi's commitment to societal values and interests. The count is likely to lead to demands to raise quotas that reserve government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for certain castes, particularly Other Backward Classes. While colonial rulers Britain began an Indian census in 1872 and counted all castes until 1931, independent India since 1951 only counted Dalits and Adivasis.</p>

While assessing the possibility of starting negotiations, Chinese authorities reiterated Beijing's request for the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs, emphasizing that failure to do so would indicate a lack of sincerity from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on imported Chinese goods, prompting China to impose retaliatory levies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that U.S.-China tariffs at their current levels are "not sustainable on the Chinese side."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs, affecting e-commerce trade in small parcels. This measure, aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers, has led to higher prices for Americans shopping online. The de minimis rule, which allowed products up to $800 to avoid tariffs, resulted in a surge of individually addressed packages to the United States. The change is expected to impact airlines, private carriers, and small retailers, with Temu and Shein already adjusting their pricing strategies.</p>
