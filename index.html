          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez held their wedding festivities in Venice, drawing a high-profile crowd including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian. The lavish event, with around 200 guests, took place at venues like the Madonna dell'Orto church ahead of the main ceremony. However, the influx of celebrities sparked local backlash, leading to protests and the formation of the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, which taps into broader European frustrations over tourism's impact on local costs and housing.</p>

          <p>A new federal vaccine advisory panel, appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., held its first vote, recommending against the use of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in flu shots. This decision was made despite scientific consensus on its safety and its rare use in current vaccines. The committee also endorsed a new RSV shot for newborns but faced strong criticism from medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics for bypassing rigorous review processes and potentially undermining public trust in established science.</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing on U.S. strikes against Iran, several key Senate Democrats have publicly doubted the Trump administration's claim that Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated." Senators Chris Murphy and Mark Warner suggested the president was misleading the public, stating the program was likely set back by only months, not years, as significant knowledge and capability remain. They also criticized the administration for lacking a coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, highlighting a deep partisan divide on the issue.</p>

          <p>The iconic saguaro cactus, a symbol of the American Southwest, is dying at an alarming rate due to the effects of rising temperatures and prolonged heatwaves in the Sonoran Desert. Researchers at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix report that the annual death rate for saguaros has jumped from 1-2% to nearly 7%, a pace that far exceeds the century or more it takes for a new cactus to grow. Scientists are now working to identify and cultivate more heat-resilient varieties to prevent the potential disappearance of these desert giants.</p>
