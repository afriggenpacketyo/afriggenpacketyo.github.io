        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her first significant address since departing Washington, Kamala Harris acknowledged Democratic anxieties regarding the current political climate and commended leaders actively voicing their concerns. Speaking in San Francisco, Harris warned of a potential constitutional crisis if the courts and Congress fail to check the president's power. She emphasized the importance of safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms, suggesting that the American people must serve as the ultimate check on executive power if other institutions falter. Harris's remarks come as she considers a potential run for California governor in 2026, a decision she believes would preclude a future presidential bid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of Israeli reservists, including former Mossad head Danny Yatom, have signed letters urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to halt the Gaza war and prioritize a hostage deal with Hamas. These reservists argue that the war's continuation undermines its stated goals and endangers the remaining hostages. Yatom emphasized that his criticism stems from national concerns rather than political motives, fearing that Israel is losing its way. Reports indicate a decline in reserve attendance, signaling a looming crisis for the military, which heavily relies on reservists, and recent polls suggest widespread public support for a ceasefire and hostage release agreement.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Glasgow University have confirmed the increasing presence of mosquitoes in Scotland, with over 20 species now identified, including some in Shetland. A citizen science project has been instrumental in understanding the extent of the mosquito population, with numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting. Researchers initially suspected midges or clegs, but analysis revealed mosquitoes actively trying to bite people. The insects are most often found in woodland areas, particularly pine forests, and larvae have been discovered in stagnant water in urban areas like Glasgow.</p>

          <p>In a speech in San Francisco, Kamala Harris delivered a strong rebuke of Donald Trump's initial 100 days in office, characterizing them as a "wholesale abandonment of America’s highest ideals." Harris praised leaders and institutions resisting the president's agenda and emphasized the importance of courage in the face of fear. She accused the Trump administration of deliberately creating fear and chaos to consolidate executive power, pushing the country towards a constitutional crisis. Harris, who is considering a run for California governor or another presidential bid, urged Americans to continue organizing and defending their rights.</p>

          <p>The United States military, while possessing advanced equipment, lacks the necessary quantity of resources, including personnel, ammunition, ships, and aircraft, to effectively engage in a major war. The current armed forces are equipped for short, high-intensity conflicts but are ill-prepared for prolonged and violent engagements. The authors argue that the Pentagon should prioritize strengthening combat power by increasing active service members, ammunition production, and the construction of new ships and aircraft. They highlight the need for multiyear purchasing contracts to incentivize defense companies to increase production. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced an agreement with Ukraine to share future revenues from the country's mineral reserves, creating a joint investment fund. This deal aims to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's stability while addressing concerns about providing Kyiv with unconditional financial support. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the agreement signals a commitment to a free and prosperous Ukraine, ensuring that those who supported Russia's war efforts will not benefit from Ukraine's reconstruction. The deal, initially proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, will involve the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation working with Ukraine to finalize the details.</p>

While critics initially viewed the deal as exploitative, the final terms are more equitable, allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources. The agreement, which still requires approval from Ukraine’s parliament, ensures revenue through contracts and aims to attract global investment into the country.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of trade policies, particularly U.S. tariffs, on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The BOJ now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a significant decrease from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent. This decision comes as President Trump's tariff threats weigh heavily on economic prospects around the world. The central bank also decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent, complicating efforts to revert to more conventional monetary policies.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee has scaled back a controversial bill aimed at ending solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, limiting its impact to those who sell their homes. The original bill, AB 942, sought to reduce the benefits of the current program for those who installed solar panels before April 15, 2025, but the committee removed a provision that would have limited the program's benefits to 10 years. Despite the amendment, many rooftop solar owners expressed concerns that the bill would still reduce the value of their homes, while utilities and labor unions supported the measure.</p>

          <p>In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Kamala Harris criticized President Trump's tariff policies, characterizing them as "reckless" and a potential cause of recession. Speaking at an Emerge America event in San Francisco, Harris argued that the tariffs would increase everyday costs and negatively impact retirement accounts and small businesses. She praised those who are standing up to the Trump administration and warned that things may get worse before they get better. Harris also emphasized the importance of upholding the system of checks and balances to prevent a constitutional crisis.</p>

The decline in ad spending is attributed to preparations for the end of the de minimis trade loophole, which has benefited online retailers like Temu and Shein. This shift has impacted Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region, which fell below Wall Street projections.
