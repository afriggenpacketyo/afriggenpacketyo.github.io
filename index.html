          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index soared to a new all-time high, driven by optimism surrounding potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and favorable inflation data. A significant contributor to the rally was tech investment giant SoftBank Group, whose shares jumped nearly 10%. This surge followed reports of a major cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, a company linked to SoftBank through the U.S. Stargate program. While the Nikkei saw broad gains led by energy and utilities, other Asian markets presented a mixed picture, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declining. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in Utah, vigils were organized across the United States to mourn his death and condemn political violence. Supporters, politicians, and community leaders gathered in various cities, including Seattle and Washington D.C., for prayer and reflection. The New York Yankees held a moment of silence to honor the 31-year-old conservative figure. Tributes came from a wide array of public figures, from former President Trump to California Governor Gavin Newsom, all calling for national unity and an end to violent political acts.</p>

          <p>China has opened the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, significantly reducing travel time between the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou. The 10.3-kilometer structure is a multi-modal crossing, uniquely designed to carry an expressway, a local road, and an intercity railway simultaneously. Its innovative asymmetrical lower deck, which places a high-speed railway and a regular road side-by-side, represents a first for a large-span bridge design. This engineering feat aims to enhance regional connectivity and transportation efficiency in Jiangsu province.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has formally appealed a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocked him from removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The appeal challenges Judge Jia Cobb's decision, which stated that Cook's reinstatement serves the public interest in maintaining the Federal Reserve's independence. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, is contesting her dismissal, arguing it is a pretextual move in a broader campaign by the president to influence the central bank's interest rate policies. The legal battle continues as Trump aims to appoint a majority to the Fed's board.</p>

          <p>An investigation led by the U.S. Coast Guard and the NTSB is examining why approximately 75 cargo containers fell from a vessel at the Port of Long Beach. The incident resulted in a minor oil sheen from a damaged clean-air barge, a sprained ankle for one worker, and significant waterlogged cargo. While the cause remains unknown, officials are exploring all factors, including potential human or mechanical error. Despite the disruption and the need for a complex recovery operation, port authorities have confirmed that the Port of Long Beach remains fully operational.</p>

This policy is also seen as a strategic response to U.S. trade pressures and ongoing negotiations regarding North American trade.

Nonprofits like DigDeep are intervening to help replace these failing systems, highlighting the critical need for investment in basic utilities.

The Royal College of Radiologists states that excessive bureaucracy and cumbersome funding applications are stifling innovation, making cutting-edge treatments like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) inconsistently available. This disparity means patients in areas with smaller or less-funded cancer centers may miss out on life-saving care.

His advice includes reframing one's mindset to stop worrying about being stressed, as stress itself is a normal reaction to life's challenges. He also highlights the importance of physical exercise to help the body manage cortisol spikes, prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule, and focusing on self-care through good nutrition and mindfulness.

          <p>California lawmakers have introduced last-minute legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which compensates victims of fires caused by utility equipment.

Utility shareholders would be required to match this amount with their own $9 billion contribution.

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who was tragically killed at age 31, rose to become one of the most influential figures in modern conservative politics after founding Turning Point USA at just 18. He built the organization into a powerful force on college campuses, creating a counterweight to prevailing liberal ideologies and mobilizing a new generation of young conservatives. A staunch ally of Donald Trump, Kirk played a significant role in the 2024 election's ground game. His work and provocative style made him a hero to his supporters and a controversial figure to his critics, but his impact on the youth MAGA movement is undeniable.</p>

Cramer noted that despite its initial surge, the company's valuation has not reached excessive levels. He expressed confidence in Klarna's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and 'impressive underwriting standards,' viewing it as a seasoned startup with a clear path toward profitability, despite preferring competitor Affirm overall.

          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the controversial 'mansion tax' in Los Angeles, in an effort to stimulate housing construction. The proposal would sharply reduce the tax on sales of apartment buildings and commercial properties built within the last 15 years. Critics of the original measure argue it has had a chilling effect on new development since its passage in 2022. The legislative move is also part of a broader strategy to deter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to nullify Measure ULA and other local taxes entirely.</p>

          <p>Traditional 'stand and stir' television cooking shows are facing a sharp decline, with major broadcasters like the BBC commissioning zero new half-hour programs this year. This downturn is contrasted by the explosive growth of food content on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, where food influencers garner millions of views. The shift is attributed to the agility, authenticity, and lower production costs of online content, which can respond to trends like the 'cronut' almost instantly. While TV struggles with compliance and long production timelines, online creators offer a rawer, more direct connection with audiences who now prefer it.</p>

The report, based on leaked documents and whistleblower testimony, shows the charity took in children, sometimes with changed identities, and complied with intelligence service orders to deny relatives access or custody. Since the regime's fall, families searching for over 3,700 missing children face immense challenges. SOS International has acknowledged failures and expressed deep regret, stating it was operating within a 'terror system' and is now committed to independent investigations.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's 'Squawk Box,' Jim Cramer reflected on the changes in market sentiment, noting a return to optimism around individual stock picking. He recalled the show's early days in the 1990s, when there was widespread excitement about stocks, a feeling he believes is re-emerging today. After the dot-com bubble burst, many investors shifted to safer index funds, but Cramer suggests the pendulum is swinging back. He argues that with the immense gains seen in major individual stocks like those in the data center sector, investors are once again recognizing the potential rewards of single-stock investing.

          <p>Researchers are investigating Australia's peacock spiders, known for their vibrant colors and elaborate mating dances, to understand their extraordinary diversity of over 100 species. The key may lie in their 'dark DNA'—the vast, non-gene portions of their genetic code, which is three times more abundant in them than in humans. Scientists hypothesize that this mysterious DNA enables the spiders to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. By studying this extreme case of variation, the project aims to uncover the fundamental processes that drive the evolution and diversity of all life on Earth.</p>
