          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reduced its benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, marking the third consecutive rate cut since February. This decision, below Reuters' median estimate of 5.75%, follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which expanded 7.4% year-on-year. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it acknowledges a slowdown compared to the previous financial year's 9.2%. The RBI's rate cut is also influenced by the downtrend in India's inflation, with the most recent headline inflation reading for April at 3.16%, its lowest since July 2019.

          <p>The Tokyo High Court has overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus overturning the 2022 decision that mandated the executives pay approximately 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The trial focused on whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable, especially after a TEPCO unit estimated in 2008 that a tsunami of up to 15.7 meters could hit the plant. The lawyer for the shareholders has criticized the ruling as fundamentally flawed and intends to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Dr. Casey Means, President Trump's nominee for U.S. Surgeon General, has faced criticism for promoting health and wellness products while simultaneously decrying the corruption of medical and food systems by special interests. An Associated Press review revealed that Means has promoted numerous products, sometimes without disclosing potential profits or connections to the companies. Experts have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given the Surgeon General's role in providing scientific health information to Americans. Means has defended her recommendations, stating that she personally vets and uses the products she promotes.</p>

          <p>A public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has drawn reactions from various prominent figures. The conflict started with Trump criticizing Musk's views on a Republican tax-cut and spending bill, leading to online exchanges on Truth Social and X. Bill Ackman urged Trump and Musk to reconcile, while Jim Jordan expressed hope for reconciliation while defending the budget bill. Steve Bannon suggested Trump should seize SpaceX and suspend federal contracts to Musk's companies, and Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed a proposal from Musk to create a new political party.</p>

          <p>Opposition is growing among MPs regarding a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, according to the BBC. While the Assisted Dying Bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, initially received support from 330 MPs, at least a dozen MPs have indicated they are now likely to vote against it. Concerns have been raised about the bill's safeguards for protecting vulnerable individuals and preventing coercion, with some MPs suggesting that amendments aimed at addressing these issues have been blocked by supporters of the bill. MPs will vote on some of the proposed changes next Friday, with a final Commons vote scheduled for the summer.</p>

          <p>Ispace, a Tokyo-based company, declared its lunar mission a failure after its private lunar lander crashed during a touchdown attempt. Communications ceased less than two minutes before the scheduled landing with a mini rover, despite a seemingly successful descent from lunar orbit. CEO Takeshi Hakamada apologized for the failed mission, which aimed to deploy a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt and place a Swedish artist's toy-size red house on the moon. A preliminary analysis suggests the laser system for measuring altitude malfunctioned, causing the lander to descend too quickly.</p>

          <p>Travis Decker, accused of murdering his three daughters, struggled with PTSD and lacked mental health resources, according to his ex-wife's attorney. The attorney, Arianna Cozart, stated that the system failed Decker, suggesting that the tragedy could have been avoided if he had received adequate support. Cozart emphasized that Decker was not violent before the incident and was an active father in his daughters' lives. The attorney is now advocating for changes in mental health resources for veterans and reforms to the Amber Alert system.</p>

          <p>North Korea has launched a warship, just two weeks after it was damaged during an earlier launch attempt. The previous incident drew harsh criticism from leader Kim Jong Un, who deemed it a result of "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism." The 5,000-tonne destroyer, which was restored to balance earlier this week, is now moored at a pier. Kim's swift and severe response to the earlier failure signals Pyongyang's continued commitment to advancing its military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts, but he later reversed the decision. This back-and-forth occurred amid an escalating dispute between Musk and Trump, sparked by Musk's criticism of the Republican president's major tax bill. Musk's initial tweet responded to Trump's statement about terminating governmental subsidies and contracts. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, and SpaceX has been developing a replacement for it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reiterating his claims, without providing evidence, that aides to former President Joe Biden illegally used an autopen to enact policies. Trump stated that he could discern which executive orders were signed with an autopen, claiming that aides used it to implement policies that Biden didn't support. Biden has denied these allegations, and the Justice Department's legal counsel have endorsed autopens as lawful for signing bills into law. Trump has ordered the Justice Department to investigate the matter, calling it potentially the "biggest scandal" in recent history.</p>

The athleisure brand is one of many businesses warning about the effects of President Trump's trade policies, with Lululemon experiencing lower store traffic in the Americas due to economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. The company plans to implement strategic price increases on a small portion of its products and will cut costs and negotiate with vendors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that in many states, young offenders are denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike the adult system where "time served" awaiting trial is factored into the sentence. This practice adds months to the duration that kids are confined away from their families, and it has enormous costs to the taxpayer and detriment to young people. Experts argue that this lack of time credit undermines the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system, leaving kids languishing in detention without access to services or proper education. The system's focus on rehabilitation, rather than punishment, ironically leads to diminished rights for young people compared to adults.</p>
