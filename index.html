            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has stated the government's commitment to its environmental agenda, criticizing opponents of the net-zero carbon emissions target for spreading falsehoods. Miliband argues that transitioning to green power is essential for social justice and national security, citing the impact of reliance on fossil fuels after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Political rivals claim the net zero agenda jeopardizes traditional industry jobs, but Miliband contends that failing to embrace clean energy risks climate breakdown and forfeits future job opportunities. Despite previous commitments, some Tory leaders express concerns about the economic feasibility of achieving net zero by 2050.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight, with expectations for reciprocal action from Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism but proposed extending the ceasefire if Russia demonstrates genuine commitment. The announcement follows increasing frustration from the Trump administration regarding stalled peace talks. Simultaneously, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange, mediated by the UAE, marking the largest exchange since the conflict began.</p>

The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, created a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds. The bomb uses a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material, releasing hydrogen gas that ignites into a sustained inferno when activated by conventional explosives. The team, led by CSSC research scientist Wang Xuefeng, highlighted the broad explosion range and rapid flame spread of hydrogen gas explosions.</p>
