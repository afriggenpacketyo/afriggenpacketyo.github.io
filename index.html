          <p>Bill Belichick's family is reportedly worried that his relationship with Jordon Hudson could negatively impact his legacy, particularly after Hudson's recent interruption of a CBS interview with Belichick. Hudson has been increasingly involved in Belichick's professional life, including influencing decisions related to his coaching role at UNC. Sources close to the family expressed concerns that Hudson's presence and involvement are detrimental to Belichick's reputation and career, with UNC athletic staff allegedly restricting her access to the football facilities. The article suggests that Belichick's family is actively investigating Hudson's background and influence.</p>

          <p>The US government is moving forward with a plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza through private companies, a move that has raised concerns from UN agencies who say they will not participate. The plan involves setting up distribution centers protected by security contractors, with the goal of providing food and supplies to a million people. The US claims this is necessary to prevent Hamas from stealing the aid, but the UN argues that it has strong supervisory mechanisms in place. The article emphasizes the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where shortages of food, fuel, and medicine are widespread, and the prices of basic goods have skyrocketed, while the UN insists that the Israeli proposals do not meet the minimum bar for principled humanitarian support.</p>

Ozturk is challenging her confinement, claiming it violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, alleging she was targeted for criticizing Israel and participating in pro-Palestinian protests. Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her.

          <p>A member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's board, Kevin Abel, condemned the institution's silence after President Trump fired several board members, including Doug Emhoff, invoking the Holocaust to emphasize the importance of speaking out against injustice. Abel's letter sparked a heated email exchange among board members, with some defending the President's right to appoint and remove members, while others expressed disappointment at the museum's silence. Kimberly Marteau Emerson, one of the fired members, echoed Abel's concerns, highlighting the moral risk of silence in the face of evil, invoking Thomas Mann's criticism of the Nazi regime. The chairman of the board urged members to refrain from such communications, fearing unintended consequences for the museum.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signaled a potential shift from traditional Republican tax policy by expressing a willingness to consider raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Trump stated that he and others would "graciously" accept a tax increase to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but expressed concern that Democrats would exploit the situation for political gain. He referenced George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise, while ultimately suggesting Republicans should probably not pursue the idea, though he would be okay if they did.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert who has worked on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, pleaded guilty to failing to report a series of high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who is accused of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri sold artwork worth Â£140,000 to Ahmad between October 2020 and December 2021, despite reportedly being aware of Ahmad's alleged links to terrorism. The prosecution argued that Ojiri had discussed Ahmad's sanctions with others, indicating a knowledge of his illicit activities, and that the advice the Ramp Gallery received on compliance matters was not properly acted on.</p>

An 80% tariff would be a substantial reduction from the current 145% tariff on many Chinese goods, however, it is much higher than the 10% baseline tariff in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement.</p>

The USPS faces ongoing financial challenges and potential reorganization under the Trump administration, with concerns about privatization and reduced service in rural areas.

          <p>Jim Cramer, on his show Mad Money, discussed effective practices for buying stocks, emphasizing the importance of thorough research and conviction in the stock. He highlighted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) as a stock that may be undervalued, noting that a decline unrelated to the company's fundamentals can present an opportunity. Cramer cautioned against investing in troubled companies with shifting fundamentals, but suggested that TSM may be a momentarily damaged stock due to extraneous reasons. The article itself is not investment advice, but is a summary of Jim Cramer's analysis.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court who became a key member of its liberal wing, has died at 85, prompting reflections on his legacy. Souter, known for his independence and intellectual honesty, often surprised those who appointed him by siding with liberal justices on important social issues. The article details Souter's early life, career, and judicial philosophy, emphasizing his commitment to the Constitution as a charter of "ordered liberty" and his willingness to evolve his views over time. His appointment and subsequent jurisprudence serves as a cautionary tale for presidents seeking ideological predictability in their Supreme Court nominees.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, but the scope of the agreement is limited. The deal reduces or removes tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel, and aluminum, while maintaining most of President Trump's blanket tariffs on imports. The agreement is not a comprehensive trade deal, as it requires Congressional approval and further negotiations, and it only addresses specific goods.

          <p>Japan will continue to demand the full removal of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, despite a recent U.S.-Britain trade agreement that left some levies in place. The Japanese government views the full removal of "reciprocal" tariffs, including additional levies on cars, steel, and aluminum, as a condition for reaching a trade agreement with Washington. The government also dismissed the idea of reducing the consumption tax rate to soften the blow from inflation and U.S. tariffs, while urging caution over pleasure flights near the Senkaku Islands amid tensions with China.</p>
