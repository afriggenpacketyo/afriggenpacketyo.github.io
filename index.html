          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 05:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell, alleging that their actions contributed to the death of a woman in Seattle during a 2021 heatwave. The plaintiff claims that these companies knowingly fueled climate change by manufacturing and marketing fossil fuels, leading to extreme weather events and foreseeable loss of life. The lawsuit seeks damages and a public education campaign to correct misinformation about the link between fossil fuels and climate change. Legal experts say the case could set a precedent for holding fossil fuel corporations accountable for their role in climate change, potentially leading to further litigation and financial penalties. The outcome hinges on proving the companies' specific contributions to global emissions and the link between those emissions and the heatwave that caused the death.</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters may flourish in UK waters as they adapt to rising ocean temperatures. A study mapped the responses of 19 threatened marine species to climate change, identifying potential biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea within the next 50 years. While mobile species are expected to adapt well, static creatures like sea pens and the ocean quahog clam may struggle, impacting ecosystems and food chains. The findings aim to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas, emphasizing the need to manage threats like fishing, disease, and pollution to ensure these species thrive in their new habitats.</p>

          <p>Rising egg prices have led to a surge in interest among Americans in raising chickens at home, with searches for DIY chicken coop plans increasing significantly. Tractor Supply Co. reports a rise in chicken coop sales and chick purchases, indicating a growing trend of backyard poultry farming. Experts advise potential chicken owners to consider the long-term commitment, costs, and local regulations involved in raising chickens. While backyard chickens can provide fresh eggs and encourage outdoor activity, they require significant care, financial investment, and protection from predators and diseases.</p>

The number of Chinese companies attending the show has more than doubled since 2023, with many making their first appearance in Paris.

          <p>A new CDC report indicates that drug overdose deaths in the U.S. are rising again after a period of decline, with roughly 1,400 more deaths recorded in the 12-month period ending in January 2025. While still below the peak of 114,664 deaths in August 2023, this increase is concerning to addiction researchers who fear the positive trends of 2024 may be fading. Most overdose deaths are caused by fentanyl, often mixed with other dangerous substances like cocaine, methamphetamines, and veterinary tranquilizers. Experts emphasize the need for continued public health investments to address the ongoing addiction and overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>Scientists and advocates in environmental health are expressing concern over the Trump administration's actions, which appear to contradict the stated goals of the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda. Despite Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on reducing exposure to toxic chemicals and environmental pollutants, the administration has cut funding for relevant research, weakened environmental safeguards, and appointed individuals with conflicts of interest to key positions at the EPA. These actions have disrupted investigations into toxic substances, imperiled scientific work, and delayed the implementation of drinking water standards on PFAS chemicals. Critics argue that the administration's rhetoric about clean air and water is undermined by its actions to prioritize deregulation and cut staff at agencies responsible for protecting public health.</p>

The main rate of inflation remained at 3.4% in May, while food prices grew for the third consecutive month. Bad harvests in cocoa-producing regions, particularly Ghana and Ivory Coast, have led to chocolate stocks falling to all-time lows. Some economists suggest that businesses are passing on recent increases in employer National Insurance payments to customers, further driving up food prices.</p>

          <p>Despite rent control measures, rental prices in major German cities continue to soar, with advertised rents in the 14 largest independent cities nearly doubling over the past decade. Berlin has experienced the greatest rise in new rental prices, followed by Leipzig and Bremen. Munich remains the most expensive city for renters, with monthly rental prices reaching nearly â‚¬22 per square meter. While Germany has laws in place to limit rent increases in regions with tight housing markets, lessors are not subject to government supervision, requiring tenants to report suspected violations themselves.</p>

          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering" to lower their duty liabilities by strategically altering product classifications. This involves changing an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code, which can result in lower tariff rates. While not inherently illegal, this practice requires careful navigation of over 5,000 product classification codes used by U.S. customs authorities. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding zippered pockets to women's shirts to qualify for lower duties.</p>

          <p>The Club World Cup is experiencing low attendance, leading to discussions about the reasons behind the empty seats and the implications for the tournament. While the empty seats represent unrealized revenues and marketing missteps, the core issue is Fifa's tendency to overemphasize the luxurious excesses of the World Cup, overshadowing the intimate nature of club fandom. Factors contributing to the low turnout include high ticket prices, fears of Ice raids, visa processing difficulties for traveling fans, and inconvenient game times. Despite the empty seats, the enthusiasm of the fans who do attend tells a different story, highlighting the need to view the tournament through a more realistic lens.</p>
