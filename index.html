          <p>Afghanistan is currently enduring a total internet blackout, as reported by watchdog Netblocks, following the Taliban government's decision to sever fiber-optic internet connections. This action, implemented weeks after initial disruptions, aims to prevent what the Taliban deems immorality, aligning with their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law since seizing power in 2021. The shutdown has severely impacted telecommunications, including mobile internet and satellite TV, disrupting international news agencies and causing cancellations of flights from Kabul airport. Business leaders had previously warned of severe economic repercussions from such a ban.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's plan to cut 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America (VOA). Judge Royce Lamberth ruled to preserve the status quo, citing "concerning disrespect" from the administration regarding previous orders to restore VOA programming. The administration had sought to reduce VOA's operations, calling its content "radical propaganda," but employees argued the cuts would undermine VOA's statutory mission to provide reliable news. This legal battle highlights tensions over the government-funded broadcaster's independence and its role in projecting U.S. values globally.</p>

He later capped the drive with a touchdown pass to Darren Waller, contributing to Miami's early lead.

          <p>A BBC investigation revealed that nurses, pharmacists, and a bogus doctor in the UK are endangering patients by illegally supplying Botox without proper consultations. Undercover filming showed a nurse trading prescriptions via WhatsApp and a pharmacist coaching clients to falsify records, bypassing essential safety checks. These shortcuts increase risks like drooping eyelids, headaches, and even respiratory failure or death, with the UK medicines regulator recording a significant rise in complications and 12 deaths since 2015. Regulators have expressed "very concerned" and pledged to review the evidence and take enforcement action against these unsafe practices.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, calling for an immediate end to military operations and Hamas to accept the terms. The proposal includes Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of two dozen deceased hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The plan stipulates no role for Hamas in Gaza's governance, outlines a "technocratic" temporary committee overseen by an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. Trump warned of full U.S. backing for Israel to "finish the job" if Hamas rejects the agreement.</p>

          <p>The NFL has announced Puerto Rican global superstar Bad Bunny as the headliner for Super Bowl LX's halftime show in 2026, a decision that has sparked significant commentary, particularly from conservative circles.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Tuesday, with significant attention focused on the upcoming interest rate decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Analysts anticipate the RBA will maintain its cash rate at 3.6% due to persistent high inflation, which limits the central bank's capacity to ease monetary policy. Any alterations in the RBA's tone or future guidance could influence Australian dollar crosses, especially after recent fluctuations in building approvals data. Meanwhile, major U.S. averages closed higher overnight, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite regaining ground after a period of volatility in the artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>Oregon has initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration following President Trump's directive to deploy 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland to protect federal property. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that the president lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard for this purpose, emphasizing that local officials can manage public safety without federal intervention. The White House, however, asserts Trump is using lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel amidst what it describes as "violent riots." This legal challenge underscores a broader conflict between state and federal authority regarding domestic deployments and protest management.</p>

With 60 votes needed in the Senate, neither party can pass a bill independently, leading to a blame game.

The states claim the administration is unlawfully conditioning this aid on their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, despite a recent federal judge's ruling against such practices. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the move as an illegal attempt to coerce states into federal immigration campaigns, arguing it undermines community safety by defunding critical programs.

          <p>Donald Trump's new 20-point Gaza peace plan, unveiled with Benjamin Netanyahu, is met with significant skepticism regarding its feasibility despite Trump's optimistic pronouncements. The article highlights fundamental disagreements, such as Hamas's reluctance to disarm and Israel's varied stances on troop withdrawal and Palestinian statehood. While the plan includes elements like hostage release and a temporary "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, analysts believe Netanyahu may be counting on Hamas's refusal to secure U.S. backing for continued military action. The commentary suggests that without sustained pressure and political shifts, a lasting peace remains far from certain.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests a government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact the stock market, drawing on historical market reactions to past shutdowns. While acknowledging the potential for 800,000-900,000 temporary job losses and a hit to GDP growth, Cramer's primary concern is the delay of crucial economic data. This delay could complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, though he believes a rate cut might still occur due to the shutdown's broader economic detriment. He differentiates a shutdown from a debt ceiling default, noting the U.S. can still pay bondholders.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced a new action plan to curb cutthroat competition within the strategic non-ferrous metals sector. The plan projects a reduced output growth of 1.5% for primary non-ferrous metals this year, down from 4.3% last year, shifting focus to optimizing industrial structure for value-added output growth of about 5%. It also prioritizes advancements in exploring key metals like copper and lithium, developing ultra-pure materials, and enhancing recycling of used batteries and solar panels. This policy aims to address depressed processing fees and strengthen the sector's supply to hi-tech industries.</p>

Concerns are raised about the security risk of gathering top military command and the President in one location, and the potential for public dismissals.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is reportedly investigating the development of stealthy flying-wing aircraft designed to serve as "arsenal planes" capable of carrying dozens of air-to-air missiles. This concept aims to augment the "magazine depth" for crewed fighters in high-intensity conflicts, particularly against China in the Indo-Pacific. While an air-to-air version of the B-21 Raider was previously discussed, the Air Force is now considering other platforms and even uncrewed combat air vehicles (UCAVs) for this role.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also formalized a directive to deploy federal officers to defend ICE facilities, potentially using grant funding for equipment like body-worn cameras. The Office of Personnel Management guidance suggests federal employees overseeing firings can work during a shutdown, and furloughed workers can check for layoff emails.</p>
