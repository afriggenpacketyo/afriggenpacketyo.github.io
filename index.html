          <p>Donald Trump's attempt to overturn a civil jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and defaming her has been rejected by a federal appeals court. The court declined to rehear his challenge to the $5 million judgment. Two judges dissented from the decision, asserting that the panel made striking departures from legal precedent. Carroll's attorney stated that Trump's efforts to challenge the findings of two separate juries have failed, and he remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. The legal battle between Trump and Carroll continues, with Trump having the option to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced a breakthrough in the fight to reauthorize and expand access to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which provides compensation to individuals exposed to nuclear waste. The Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes the largest expansion of the program since its inception in 1990. Individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation from atomic bomb testing, will be eligible for compensation. Hawley calls this a "huge step forward" and a "huge victory" for those affected by nuclear exposure, with the Senate having previously passed expansions that failed in the House due to cost concerns.</p>

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, India, killing all but one of the 242 people on board, prompting renewed discussions about air safety in the rapidly growing Indian aviation market. The cause of the crash is under investigation, with authorities focusing on engine failure, sabotage, technical malfunction, or environmental hazards. India's aviation regulator has ordered safety checks on the entire Boeing-787 fleet. The Indian government aims to increase the number of airports to over 350 by 2047 and is investing billions in expanding and modernizing existing ones, recognizing the importance of maintaining confidence in the civil aviation sector.</p>

The film highlights the views of Daniella Weiss, a leader in the settler movement, who dismisses international law and sees the Gaza war as an opportunity. The documentary also features American settlers who believe the Jewish homeland is their birthright and that settling the land prevents terror. Critics argue the film unfairly focuses on a fringe minority, while supporters emphasize the influence of these views within the Israeli government.</p>

The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, surpassing expectations, with improvements across current conditions and future expectations. This shift coincides with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs and a 90-day negotiation period, notably with China. Despite these improvements, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, with ongoing worries about the impact of tariffs on prices and geopolitical concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, "Jane" concluded her testimony, recounting her experiences with Combs and the events of a night involving sexual encounters and violence. Prosecutors aimed to reframe suggestive text messages between "Jane" and Combs, emphasizing her lack of physical pleasure during encounters with entertainers and her coerced participation. The defense highlighted texts showing tender moments and questioned her decision not to report the violence earlier. Court adjourned with plans to resume with testimony from a federal agent, a Combs assistant, and another witness.</p>

Padilla was removed, tackled, and handcuffed at a press conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, highlighting an escalation of the administration's assertion of authority. The Trump administration's military deployment to Los Angeles, met with resistance, is viewed as an attempt to crush dissent and assert dominance.

          <p>The military parade orchestrated by Donald Trump on the Army's 250th anniversary and his speech at Fort Bragg signal a desire to use the military in a new way, raising concerns about how the military may begin to see itself. The parade and the deployment of Marines to Los Angeles aim to acclimate Americans to the sight of the military in their streets and signal to governors that Trump will use the forces at his disposal to override their wishes. By politicizing the military, Trump risks the military becoming an independent actor with an independent say in who runs the country.</p>

          <p>Psychological research suggests that narratives about social breakdown could increase support for President Trump and authoritarianism, as people seek order and control during perceived societal instability. Trump's comparison of protests to a "foreign invasion" and the deployment of the National Guard feed a narrative of a state of emergency. Studies show that individuals who perceive society as unstable are more likely to support authoritarian leaders, and Trump's favorability has increased amid the protests. Counteracting this requires addressing the uncertainty caused by perceived social breakdown and better communication on the meaning and purpose of politics.</p>
