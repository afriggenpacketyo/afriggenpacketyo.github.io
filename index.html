        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high fructose corn syrup, fell sharply following a statement by Donald Trump. Trump claimed he convinced Coca-Cola to switch to using real cane sugar in its U.S. products, a move he described as "just better." While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the announcement also caused a drop in other related stocks like Ingredion. The Corn Refiners Association warned the change could lead to significant American job losses and harm farm income by increasing reliance on foreign sugar.</p>

          <p>Uber is partnering with electric vehicle maker Lucid and autonomous driving startup Nuro to deploy over 20,000 robotaxis in the next six years. As part of the deal, Uber will invest $300 million into Lucid, which will supply the vehicles. Nuro will provide the Level 4 self-driving technology, allowing the cars to operate without a human driver under most conditions. This collaboration aims to launch in a major U.S. city next year, expanding Uber's footprint in the autonomous ride-hailing market and creating a new commercial avenue for Lucid's EV technology.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 08:35:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has cleared the names of Errol Campbell and Ronald De Souza, who were wrongly convicted in the 1970s based on fabricated evidence from a corrupt British Transport Police officer, Derek Ridgewell. Ridgewell, who died in prison in 1982, systematically framed young Black men for theft and robbery. This marks the 13th such conviction to be overturned, with the court expressing regret for the decades of suffering endured by the victims and their families. The case has renewed calls for automatic reviews of convictions involving officers later found to be corrupt.</p>

          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, the company's strategy of leveraging its vast intellectual property portfolio remains a cornerstone of its success. The experiences division, which includes theme parks and resorts, is a major profit driver, fueled by acquisitions like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. This approach involves creating immersive lands and attractions based on popular franchises, from classic films to modern blockbusters like "Avatar" and "The Avengers." While this sometimes means replacing older, non-IP-based rides, the strategy successfully broadens the parks' appeal and boosts revenue across Disney's global footprint.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party is assessing comments made by MP Diane Abbott, who recently stated she does not regret a controversial 2023 letter that led to her suspension. In the interview, she reiterated her view that racism based on skin color is distinct from prejudice experienced by Jewish, Irish, or Traveller communities, as skin color is immediately visible. Her original letter was condemned as antisemitic, and she was only readmitted to the party just before the last election. A Labour spokesperson confirmed the new remarks are being taken "incredibly seriously" and will be reviewed under party rules.</p>

Maher emphasized that public media is a critical component of emergency alert systems in nearly half of all states, particularly in rural areas.

Simultaneously, states with abortion bans have seen a significant rise in preventable maternal deaths and criminal prosecutions of pregnant individuals for miscarriages.

          <p>A lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey, has resulted in the death of one person and injuries to fourteen others. The incident occurred during a children's archery competition on Wednesday evening. A volunteer instructor described the strike as happening suddenly, with no prior rain, causing the "earth to explode." The deceased was identified as 61-year-old Robert Montgomery, a club member who was volunteering at the event. The injured individuals, including a 7-year-old, were transported to local hospitals for treatment of various injuries.</p>

          <p>An apparent Israeli military strike has hit the Holy Family Compound, Gaza's sole Catholic church, reportedly killing two people and injuring several others, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem confirmed the fatalities and condemned the attack, stating that "nothing can justify the targeting of innocent civilians." The church had been serving as a shelter for hundreds of displaced Christians and Muslims. The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged reports of the incident and stated that the circumstances were under review, while Israel's Foreign Ministry expressed sorrow over the damage and any civilian casualties.</p>

The bill, which passed 51-48, includes approximately $8 billion in cuts to foreign aid programs and over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The legislation, pushed by the Trump administration to reduce federal spending, was amended to preserve funding for the PEPFAR global HIV/AIDS program. The package now returns to the House of Representatives for a final vote, where its passage is uncertain due to the changes made by the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact check by DW has determined that the claim circulating on social media that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer is false. Health officials and scientific evidence confirm that there is no support for this association; in fact, sunscreen is crucial for filtering the UV radiation that causes skin cancer. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products. While countries with high sunscreen use, like Australia, also have high skin cancer rates, this correlation does not imply causation, as many other lifestyle and environmental factors are involved.</p>

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing global health concern linked to anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Scientific research suggests that beating this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than a single quick fix. Effective, evidence-based methods include physical changes like leaving the phone out of the bedroom, digital adjustments like turning off notifications, and using self-control apps. For more severe cases, therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction, which often stem from a desire to escape stress or other mental health challenges.</p>

The drugs were discovered hidden in a shipment of bananas originating from Latin America, marking Russia's largest bust from the region this year. The cocaine packages were concealed in a hidden compartment within the banana containers and disguised with the label of a luxury fashion brand.

          <p>At Donald Trump's request, Texas Republicans are preparing to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This mid-decade redistricting is a risky political gamble that could dilute the influence of the state's growing non-white population, who accounted for 95% of recent population growth. To create new GOP-leaning districts, mapmakers would need to spread Republican voters thinner, potentially making existing Republican seats more competitive. Critics and watchdog groups argue the move is an undemocratic effort to trample on minority voting rights for political gain.</p>
