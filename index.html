          <p>A federal judge in New York dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Blake Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, their publicist Leslie Sloane, and his defamation claim against The New York Times. The judge stated that the Times reviewed the evidence and reported what it believed happened, lacking a motive to favor Lively. Baldoni has until June 23 to refile some claims, while Lively's lawyers called the dismissal a victory and plan to seek attorneys' fees and damages. The legal battle stemmed from Lively's accusations of sexual harassment against Baldoni on the set of "It Ends With Us," which he denied, leading to dueling lawsuits and campaigns between the co-stars. The optimism score for this article is rather low due to the nature of the accusations and legal battle.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This move comes after Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos resigned from ACIP, citing concerns about helping vulnerable populations.

Protesters blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire, while police used tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowd. California Governor Gavin Newsom intends to sue the Trump administration for deploying the Guard without consulting him, calling it "illegal and immoral." As of midday Monday, 53 people have been arrested on charges including failure to disperse, arson, and looting, reflecting the intensity of the demonstrations against the immigration crackdown.

          <p>Dell Technologies has pledged to provide $1,000 for so-called Trump accounts for new children of its employees, matching the government's contribution if the savings program for newborns becomes law. CEO Michael Dell vowed to match the government's seed money "dollar for dollar" during a White House roundtable with President Trump. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon also expressed support for the savings account plan, which is part of the Republican-backed budget bill moving through Congress. The program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck’s RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, creating competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. The shot aims to protect infants during their first RSV season, with orders expected to begin in July and shipments before the season starts. Enflonsia reduces RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% and decreases hospitalizations due to lower respiratory infections by 90% compared to a placebo. This approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year, increasing prospects for infant health.</p>
