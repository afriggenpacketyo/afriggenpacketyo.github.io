          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor has defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The final bout of their historic trilogy was a tactical and gripping contest, with Taylor boxing smartly and using her speed to counter Serrano's pressure. Unlike their contentious second fight, this verdict was more decisive, sealing a historic rivalry in women's boxing. Both fighters expressed immense respect for each other after the match, which concluded an all-female card at the iconic venue for the first time.</p>

          <p>The owner of a multi-million pound penthouse in Mayfair has been in an eight-year legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family. The dispute, which began over a lift installation agreement, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched refurbishments, and a noisy lift being run maliciously at night. This protracted conflict at the exclusive Hyde Park Residence highlights the combative business approach associated with Al Fayed, which appears to continue after his death. The article also notes the building's connection to past sexual assault allegations against Fayed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Starter Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs and putting the Dodgers in a deep deficit that even a Shohei Ohtani splash-down home run couldn't overcome. The Dodgers' offense, which had been quiet recently, came alive in the later innings but ultimately fell short, stranding key runners. This losing streak, the team's longest since 2017, has narrowed their division lead to just four games.</p>

          <p>A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky to face multiple charges. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of the man, Sedrick T. Stevenson, smiling broadly while seated on the plane under heavy guard. The multi-agency effort to secure his return was extensive, with officials joking he received "VIP service." Stevenson had been on the run for over a month after slipping away from an agent at a ticket counter while in shackles.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah amounts to a plan for a concentration camp and a crime against humanity. The author contends that while the world decries the failure of international law, it has never truly protected Palestinians, citing the unimplemented 1948 UN resolution on the right of return. The piece suggests that accountability for Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank will not come from legal institutions but from the enduring resilience and humanity of the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations in Qatar for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are reportedly close to collapsing, according to Palestinian officials. Deep divisions remain on key issues, including the mechanism for humanitarian aid distribution and the extent of Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza. Palestinian sources accuse the Israeli delegation of stalling for diplomatic purposes during Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to Washington. A major sticking point was a map provided by Israel showing its proposed buffer zones, which contradicted earlier messages and eroded trust.</p>

The authority argues a new, three-track bridge is necessary to handle projected growth in rail traffic, proposing to move the old structure to a new location. However, a coalition of international experts, preservationists, and thousands of residents are fighting the plan, arguing the historic bridge is a crucial part of Prague's skyline and can be repaired and supplemented with a second, slender bridge instead.</p>
