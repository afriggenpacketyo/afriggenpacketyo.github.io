          <p>In Lexington, Kentucky, an 8-year-old boy mistakenly ordered nearly 70,000 Dum-Dums lollipops online, resulting in a $4,200 charge.

          <p>A West Point philosophy professor resigned after 13 years, citing the academy’s shift away from core educational principles under the Trump administration. He criticizes the institution for censoring its curriculum to align with the administration’s ideological preferences, following an executive order prohibiting instruction on theories deemed "un-American." Courses dealing with race, gender, and power dynamics were removed, and faculty faced restrictions on publishing or speaking about their academic work. The professor argues that West Point's submission to the administration damages its mission and values.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade deal with the United Kingdom, the first since implementing new tariffs in April. The deal includes a 10% baseline tariff on UK imports, adjusted tariffs on autos, and increased market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture. The agreement also aims to enhance industrial and agricultural market access, streamline customs procedures, and secure supply chains for aerospace and pharmaceutical products. While touted as a breakthrough, some experts downplay its impact and question whether the approach can be replicated with countries having larger trade deficits with the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump withdrew his nomination of Ed Martin to be the U.S. Attorney for Washington after Senator Thom Tillis opposed the nomination due to Martin's defense of January 6 rioters. Martin's association with a man who made antisemitic remarks also contributed to the opposition. The New York Times article details Martin's history as a conservative political operative with no prosecutorial experience, and his efforts to investigate Democrats and critics of Elon Musk. The article also discusses the impact of the decision on the balance of power in the Senate and the potential for a more palatable nominee to be selected.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing growing opposition from Labour MPs over planned welfare cuts, with some warning they are "impossible to support" without a "change of direction". Forty-two MPs have voiced their concerns about the potential impact on disabled people and their families. The government insists the changes will help more people find work, but critics argue that cuts don't create jobs, they only cause more hardship. Some potential rebels are being assured they won't lose the party whip if they abstain from the vote.</p>
