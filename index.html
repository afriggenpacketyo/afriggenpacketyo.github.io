          <p>Canada is experiencing a major measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 cases reported, a figure that significantly surpasses that of the United States despite a smaller population. The surge, most prevalent in Alberta and Ontario, has made Canada a global hotspot for the virus. Health experts point to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities, and the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation following the COVID-19 pandemic as key drivers. Officials believe the reported cases represent only "the tip of the iceberg" and stress the need for increased immunization to control the spread.</p>

          <p>The body of a 9-year-old Canadian girl, Melina Frattolin, was discovered in Ticonderoga, New York, after her father reported her missing and possibly abducted near Lake George. New York State Police are now investigating the father, Luciano Frattolin, due to "inconsistencies" in his account of the events. Authorities have stated there is currently no indication of an abduction and no threat to the public. An official news conference is scheduled as the investigation into the girl's death continues.</p>

          <p>Scott Turner, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a former player for the Washington Redskins, has publicly supported President Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to change their name back. Turner, who played for the team in the 1990s, stated on social media that the president is right and it is time to restore the original name. This endorsement follows Trump's statements urging both the Commanders and MLB's Cleveland Guardians to revert to their former names, even suggesting a new stadium deal could be contingent on the change.</p>

          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, the stock market is being buoyed by several positive factors, according to a recent analysis. Strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, have set a positive tone for the current season. Furthermore, proposed tax relief measures in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," including extensions of tax cuts and new deductions, are expected to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy. Other key drivers include business tax relief, major infrastructure spending on data centers and the grid, and a more favorable environment for mergers and acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving its Pensions Commission to address a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that future pensioners could be financially worse off than today's retirees. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, nearly half of working-age adults, especially the self-employed and low earners, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will explore ways to boost private pension savings and build a national consensus on a future strategy. This initiative aims to tackle significant gaps in pension wealth, including a notable disparity based on gender and ethnicity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities and believing non-criminals are being targeted. This shift has contributed to a decline in the president's approval rating, especially among Hispanic Americans. The poll also indicates that a large majority of Americans want the administration to focus more on lowering prices, and most disapprove of the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill," believing it primarily benefits the wealthy. The findings highlight a growing divide between Trump's political base and the broader public on key policy issues.</p>

The election outcome reflects voter frustration over rising prices, the threat of U.S. tariffs, and a series of political scandals. This loss of control in the upper house, following a previous loss in the more powerful lower house, is expected to weaken the prime minister's influence and could lead to political instability.</p>

The initial ambition for world-leading speed and frequency drove up costs and complexity, while the political process required expensive compromises and design changes to appease local constituencies.

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, analysis of Scottie Scheffler's career highlights his rise to a level of dominance in men's golf not seen since Tiger Woods's peak. Scheffler has won four major championships in the last four seasons, and his machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments have drawn frequent comparisons to Woods. While his swing is considered unorthodox, his mental fortitude and recent improvements in his putting game have transformed him into the undisputed world number one. Peers and commentators alike acknowledge him as the new benchmark for excellence in the sport.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is shutting down the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the scientific arm responsible for providing the research that underpins environmental regulations. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the move is part of an effort to make the agency more efficient and is coupled with the creation of a new "Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions." Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing that eliminating the ORD will cripple the agency's ability to use the best available science to protect public health and the environment.</p>

          <p>At a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously advised the audience to prepare for their close-up before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where they feature fans on the large video screens. The lighthearted warning comes after a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as a CEO and HR executive from the same company, were caught in an awkward embrace on camera. That viral moment led to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by his company. Martin's new pre-song banter appears to be a subtle acknowledgment of the recent internet fallout.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied numerous parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. This skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and develops authentic confidence, which can protect a child's mental health. Parents can cultivate this by validating their child's feelings rather than dismissing them, welcoming all emotions, and modeling their own emotional regulation. Small shifts in language and interaction, focusing on curiosity over shame, can help a child build a strong and lasting sense of self-worth.</p>

While a framework deal exists, he noted that discussions between the two nations have been almost exclusively focused on tariffs, creating ongoing uncertainty. Stein expressed concern that without a broader resolution, companies are left navigating a difficult environment. He suggested that a potential U.S. reduction in tariffs related to fentanyl could be a step toward normalizing the trade relationship, but reciprocity remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has launched Better Angels, a nonprofit initiative aiming to prove that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. With a $300-million investment fund, the organization is bidding on several projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to build hundreds of units financed through a mix of private equity and conventional loans. This model aims to cut the time and cost associated with the traditional tax-credit system. By creating a pathway for capitalism to address the housing crisis, Miller hopes to attract more for-profit developers to the affordable housing market.</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of plea deals for the defendants in the Guantanamo Bay 9/11 trials has thrown the long-stalled legal process into further uncertainty. According to Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck, the collapse of these agreements, which would have taken the death penalty off the table, means the military commission proceedings will likely continue to face significant delays. The core issues that have plagued the trials for years, including the admissibility of evidence obtained through torture, remain unresolved. This development pushes any potential resolution or trial conclusion even further into the future.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died on Long Island, New York, after being pulled into a running MRI machine by a heavy metallic necklace he was wearing. The man, identified by his wife as Keith Jones-McAllister, had reportedly entered the MRI room without permission to help his wife after her scan. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the 20-pound chain he used for weight training, causing a "medical episode" from which he did not recover. The incident is a stark reminder of the dangers posed by metal objects near MRI machines, which generate extremely strong magnetic fields.</p>

Her comments follow those of teammate Jess Carter, who revealed she has received significant racial abuse during the Euro 2025 tournament. Bronze noted that while criticism is part of the sport, abuse is not, and that women's football seems to be a particular target online. The Lionesses team has decided to stop taking a knee before matches, seeking a new way to combat racism, and Bronze emphasized the players' commitment to using their platform to demand accountability from social media companies.</p>
