          <p>Citizens in Guinea participated in a referendum on a new constitution that could permit military leader General Mamady Doumbouya to run for president. The proposed changes, which are expected to pass, also extend presidential terms and create stricter rules for political parties. The vote has been boycotted by major opposition parties, who are currently suspended and have been unable to campaign against the measure. International observers, including the UN, have raised concerns about the fairness and transparency of the process amid a crackdown on political dissent and the media.</p>

          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in Kenya, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national in connection with her murder, allegedly committed by a British soldier. Wanjiru was last seen in 2012 leaving a hotel bar with British soldiers stationed in Nanyuki. Her friends recount the events of that night and the subsequent discovery of her body, highlighting the long and difficult search for justice. The case has drawn renewed attention following reports of misconduct at the British army base, prompting a UK investigation and a commitment from the Defence Secretary to help the family.</p>

After a successful season in the 800m, Hunter Bell opted against attempting a difficult double with the 1500m, following consultations that included Dame Kelly Holmes. This marks a significant moment in her career, which she is now pursuing full-time after leaving her cybersecurity job.

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting the Muse software from Collins Aerospace has caused significant travel disruption across several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Dublin. The outage, which affected check-in and baggage systems for numerous airlines, led to hundreds of flight delays and cancellations, forcing staff to resort to manual, paper-based processing. While the software provider is working to resolve the issue, airports are bracing for continued disruption and advising passengers to check their flight status. The incident has highlighted the vulnerability of the aviation industry to failures in critical digital infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly adopting a more direct, long-ball style of football, a tactic traditionally associated with lower-league teams. This strategic shift is a response to the effectiveness of high-pressing defenses, which make building up play from the back with short passes riskier. By utilizing goalkeepers with strong long-passing abilities and tall forwards, these teams can bypass the opposition's press, gain territory, and create isolated attacking duels.

          <p>Donald Trump has appointed Lindsey Halligan, one of his former defense lawyers, as the new US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The appointment follows the resignation of the previous prosecutor, Erik Siebert, who reportedly faced pressure to pursue a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. In a social media post, Trump openly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to "get things moving" on investigations into his political adversaries. The move to install a loyalist with no prosecutorial experience in a key legal position has raised concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is gaining strength over the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday. The storm is currently forecast to remain over open water, passing east of Bermuda on Monday without making landfall, and no watches or warnings are in effect. However, swells from the system are expected to reach the East Coast of the United States and Canada early next week. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by forecasters.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover Evidence of Recent Landslides on the Moon Triggered by Moonquakes</h2>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has discovered that the Moon is more geologically active than previously thought, identifying 41 new landslides that have occurred since 2009. By comparing high-resolution images taken years apart, the scientists concluded that these landslides were likely triggered by moonquakes. Published in the National Science Review, the findings challenge the conventional view that the Moon's internal activity has mostly ceased. This discovery has important implications for future lunar missions and the safety of establishing permanent human infrastructure on the lunar surface.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Signs Law Banning On-Duty Federal Officers from Wearing Masks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 23:22:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act," a new law that prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings. The legislation, which also requires officers to be identifiable by name and badge number, is a direct response to federal immigration enforcement operations in the state. Proponents of the bill argue it is a necessary measure to protect residents from what they describe as a "terror campaign" by masked agents in unmarked cars. A U.S. Attorney has stated the state law has no jurisdiction over federal agents, setting up a potential conflict.</p>
