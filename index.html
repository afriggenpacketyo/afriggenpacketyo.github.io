          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will not be running for the Georgia Senate seat in the upcoming election, citing her dissatisfaction with Senate Republicans. Greene, known for her strong allegiance to Trump and her controversial views, stated she would not "fight for a team that refuses to win." This decision comes after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp also declined to run, leaving the Republican primary field open. The Georgia Senate race is crucial for both parties as they seek to control the chamber, with recent elections in the state being closely contested.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, a constitutional right to challenge detention, for migrants. Miller justified this by claiming the U.S. faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts, however, argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a president cannot do so unilaterally. This move would significantly curtail due process for migrants and represents a dramatic escalation of the administration's immigration policies, echoing previous attempts to use the Alien Enemies Act for expedited deportations.</p>

          <p>A new BBC drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103, explores the aftermath of the Lockerbie bombing and its impact on victim response protocols. The article highlights how the experiences of the victims' families, particularly their struggle to receive timely notifications and information, led to significant improvements in how victims were treated following the 9/11 attacks. The families' activism resulted in the creation of victim services within the FBI and the Department of Justice, as well as reforms in airline procedures for dealing with victims and their families. The drama emphasizes the importance of compassion and collaboration in the face of tragedy.</p>

          <p>Financial ties between the US and China are facing increasing pressure due to trade tensions and a decline in mutual trust. New regulations, such as the Outbound Investment Rule and the America First Investment Policy, are adding hurdles to Chinese companies seeking funding in the US. Experts suggest that the erosion of trust is making financial relations particularly vulnerable, as finance heavily relies on commitments over time. The threat of delisting from US exchanges looms large for nearly 300 Chinese firms as trade disputes continue to drive the two largest economies further apart.</p>

Nishino has been compared to junior champion Rio Nakata, impressing judges and coaches with his rapidly improving skills. Despite being too young to compete in the upcoming Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Nishino's recent achievements, including landing a quad toe loop and executing a quad salchow, indicate a bright future.

He emphasized that selecting anyone but the best erodes warfighting readiness and the culture of excellence in the Armed Forces.

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the ongoing legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, a case involving allegations of sexual harassment and defamation. Swift's spokesperson claims the subpoena is a publicity stunt designed to draw attention to the case, asserting Swift had minimal involvement with the film "It Ends with Us," only permitting the use of her song. Lively sued Baldoni for sexual harassment, which he denies, and Baldoni countersued Lively for defamation. The judge has indicated the lawsuits will likely be combined into one trial in March 2026.</p>

Experts predict the re-entry will occur, but the exact location of impact remains unknown, though it will be between 52 degrees north and south latitude.

          <p>Asfandyar Mir argues that the ongoing military conflict between India and Pakistan marks a dangerous shift in their rivalry, eliminating the diplomatic space that once prevented devastating escalation. The immediate cause was a terrorist attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, but the underlying issues stem from India's rise as a geopolitical power and Pakistan's ongoing economic and political crises. India's shift towards a more absolutist endgame and Pakistan's abandonment of hope for normalized relations threaten crucial guardrails, increasing the risk of further escalation.

          <p>Pakistan has accused India of firing missiles at three of its air bases, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two nations. The Pakistani military claims that most of the missiles were intercepted, but retaliatory attacks were launched targeting an Indian missile storage facility and air bases in Pathankot and Udhampur. The conflict, which began after a deadly attack in India-controlled Kashmir, has seen increasing exchanges of fire and accusations of drone attacks from both sides. Tensions remain high as the nuclear-armed rivals continue to engage in military actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled potential openness to reducing tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" ahead of trade talks. The conciliatory tone comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. Trump also emphasized the need for China to open its markets to the U.S. Investors are anticipating a reduction below 80%, with analysts suggesting potential cuts to 50%-60% following the Geneva negotiations. UBS Global Wealth Management anticipates tariffs may settle around 34% due to a more constructive tone and the start of high-level talks.</p>

The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against consuming sport-harvested mussels along the California coastline. During this period, mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be dangerous and potentially fatal to humans. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to frequent testing for toxins.</p>
