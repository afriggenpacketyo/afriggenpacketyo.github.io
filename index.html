            <p>The ACLU of Indiana has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unlawfully terminated the status of seven international students in Indiana without explanation or due process. The lawsuit claims the students, primarily Chinese and Nigerian citizens attending universities like Purdue, Indiana University Indianapolis, and Notre Dame, were not given an opportunity to challenge the decisions, violating their rights. The ACLU argues that the Trump administration's actions are targeting international students engaged in anti-Israel protests, revoking visas for minor infractions, and creating fear among students who now face potential deportation. The suit seeks a court order to reinstate the students' status and prevent their deportation.</p>

The grueling three-day competition involves over 30 events, including long-distance movements, helicopter missions, land navigation, and weapons qualification. While the Army previously highlighted such historic firsts, current policies under President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have restricted the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

            <p>Canada is heading to the polls for a snap general election called by newly elected Liberal Party leader Mark Carney, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The election was triggered by rising tensions and a trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs on the country. The Liberal Party, led by Carney, is facing a tight race against Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party and Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party. Recent polls indicate a slight lead for the Liberals, with voters primarily concerned about responding to Trump's economic threats.</p>

            <p>Hamas has reportedly rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza that included a demand for the group to disarm. According to a Palestinian official, the proposal lacked a commitment to end the war or withdraw Israeli troops, which are key conditions for Hamas in exchange for releasing hostages. The rejection comes amid ongoing military operations in Gaza, including an Israeli airstrike on a field hospital. The UN has warned of a worsening humanitarian situation due to restrictions on supplies entering Gaza, while Israel claims its actions are aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages.</p>

With the team's domestic hopes fading, the decision of who to start in goal for the Europa League quarter-final has significant implications. The chosen goalkeeper will likely shape the future for both the manager and the team, as the overlooked keeper will likely seek a transfer in the summer, creating a further financial burden.</p>

The author criticizes the crew's focus on superficial aspects like makeup and hair, suggesting it reinforces an antifeminist vision of women dependent on men and confined to triviality. The author notes that there are some women on the mission who can be credited as serious persons: Aisha Bowe, an aerospace engineer, and Amanda Nguyen, a civil rights entrepreneur whose past work with Nasa makes her something closer to an actual astronaut.</p>

            <p>Labor groups have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's termination of international labor rights programs aimed at ending child labor and other abuses. The lawsuit argues that the cuts, enacted by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), are unauthorized by Congress and harm American workers and businesses. Critics argue the decision enables the degradation of labor and business standards abroad, making it more likely that workers will be affected by offshoring and consumers will be purchasing goods where labor abuses are rampant in the supply chain.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has shifted his stance on Iran's nuclear program, now demanding its complete elimination after previously suggesting Iran could enrich uranium at a low level for civilian purposes. This change in policy could complicate negotiations between the US and Iran, potentially increasing the risk of military action. The decision to maintain talks in Oman, rather than move them to Italy, further underscores the evolving dynamics of the situation. The shift may be due to backlash from Iran hawks who believe Witkoff's stance was too lenient and resembled the Obama-era nuclear deal.</p>
