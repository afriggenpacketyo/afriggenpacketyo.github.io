          <p>Brian Wilson, the visionary leader of the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82, according to a statement from his family. Wilson's genius for melody and arrangements led to iconic summertime anthems like "Good Vibrations" and "California Girls," making him one of the most influential recording artists. The Beach Boys, formed with his brothers Carl and Dennis, rose to international fame in the 1960s, selling over 100 million records and becoming symbols of California culture. Wilson's musical ambition pushed the Beach Boys beyond simple pop, but his personal struggles and mental health challenges also became part of the band's story, influencing his career in both positive and negative ways. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, cementing their legacy. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The preliminary injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, focuses on Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge found that Khalil's career, reputation, and speech were being irreparably harmed by the detention. However, the ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles has experienced a relative calm after a night of curfew enforcement and mass arrests, following days of protests sparked by President Trump's immigration raids. Nearly 400 people have been arrested, including undocumented migrants and individuals accused of assault and obstruction, with federal prosecutors charging two men for throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers. Mayor Karen Bass attributed the protests to Trump's immigration policies, which she claimed have caused fear and panic among residents. Trump has vowed to "liberate" the city, while Governor Gavin Newsom has accused him of an "assault" on democracy, warning that other states could be next. </p>

          <p>The head of FEMA's National Response Coordination Center, Jeremy Greenberg, has resigned, adding to a growing leadership exodus at the agency. Greenberg's departure comes shortly after the start of hurricane season, raising concerns about FEMA's readiness for potential disasters. Tony Robinson, the regional administrator for FEMA Region 6, has also announced his departure. These resignations follow President Trump's stated desire to reduce FEMA's role and shift disaster response responsibilities to the states, and some FEMA employees are confused as to whether the acting FEMA administrator was joking when he said he had not been aware that the U.S. has a hurricane season. </p>

          <p>Two former executives of the sexual wellness company OneTaste, Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, have been convicted in federal court on forced labor conspiracy charges. The executives were found guilty of manipulating young women into performing degrading sex acts for the company's benefit, as well as coercing employees into working long hours with little to no pay. OneTaste gained attention for its practice of "orgasmic meditation," but allegations of abuse and exploitation emerged over time. The company still operates as a sexual wellness company under the name The Institute of OM Foundation. </p>

          <p>The UK Chancellor's Spending Review is dominating newspaper headlines, with varying reactions to the proposed budget. The Daily Express warns of potential tax increases, while the Guardian highlights the NHS and defense as "big winners."

The Times reports that the Chancellor will likely need to raise taxes to balance the books, while the Daily Telegraph claims the police and defense are being "sacrificed." The Financial Times notes that the Home Office and Foreign Office face a "squeeze." The i Paper leads with the inevitability of tax rises, and the Daily Mirror focuses on a government lawsuit related to a Covid-era PPE deal. </p>
