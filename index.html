          <h2>Study Predicts Increased Ice Jams in China's Yellow River Due to Climate Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 02:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams in the Yellow River estuary will become more frequent by the end of the century due to global warming, affecting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. Warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart and drift downstream, where it can refreeze and accumulate in colder areas, forming ice jams. These jams can cause destructive flooding, damaging communities, wildlife, and infrastructure; integrating historical records with climate projections reveals a shift in ice jam flood hotspots downstream. The Yellow River, while considered the cradle of Chinese civilization, is also known as ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Sorrow‚Äù because of its history of devastating floods. </p>

          <p>Following the implementation of a landfill ban in Scotland at the end of the year, experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scottish waste will be transported to England daily. The ban, which covers biodegradable municipal waste, aims to reduce methane emissions from landfill sites by increasing recycling rates and utilizing energy-from-waste incinerators. However, a capacity gap exists, with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish lacking a destination, leading to councils negotiating contracts with English waste operators. Concerns arise regarding the environmental impact of transporting waste and achieving recycling targets.</p>

The provision allows the US to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions with "unfair foreign taxes" on US individuals and companies. This measure, targeting digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes, could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe haven status.

          <p>Families are grieving as officials begin handing over the remains of victims from the Air India Express crash that occurred minutes after takeoff, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. The process of DNA identification is slow and harrowing, with fragments of bodies being carefully identified and reconstructed. The crash, involving a London-bound Boeing 787, struck a medical college hostel in a residential area of Ahmedabad. Authorities have begun inspecting Air India‚Äôs entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners and a high-level committee has been set up to examine the causes of the crash.</p>

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, intended as a stepping stone to homeownership, are facing increased scrutiny due to a surge in complaints regarding repairs, costs, and selling difficulties. The complaints to the housing watchdog have risen significantly, with many shared owners feeling trapped and burdened by obligations without the rights of homeowners. Many shared owners have experienced issues with increasing service charges and difficulties with reselling their properties. While more shared ownership properties are being delivered, the increasing number of complaints highlights the challenges faced by those in the scheme.</p>

          <p>A Spanish-language commentary criticizes the Los Angeles Dodgers for their silence on recent ICE raids that have terrorized their fan base. Despite celebrating Pride Night and claiming to see everyone, the Dodgers have not issued a statement of support for the affected community, unlike other local sports teams. The commentary accuses the Dodgers of being ungrateful, disrespectful, and cowardly for not addressing the situation, especially given their large Latino fan base. The team's decision to remain silent is seen as prioritizing financial interests over social responsibility.</p>

With his air defenses seemingly ineffective and the coalition of Islamist militias shattered, Khamenei's long career is drawing to a close with a great challenge, as he grapples with preserving his legacy and power.</p>

While Trump's "America First" policies and Putin's aggression destabilize Europe, EU leaders remain paralyzed and are unable to convert public support into political momentum. The article suggests that the EU is increasingly adopting policies similar to Trump's, including on migration, climate, and civil society, and that the EU needs to articulate a compelling alternative to far-right messaging.</p>
