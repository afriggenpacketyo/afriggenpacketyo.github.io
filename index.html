          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of nearly $112,000, driven by increased institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation.

Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration, including advancing crypto legislation and Coinbase joining the S&P 500, have further supported the market.

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from enrolling new international students and retaining current foreign students, citing "pro-terrorist conduct" and accusing the university of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party.

Harvard has denounced the action as unlawful and retaliatory, vowing to maintain its ability to host international students and scholars.

While the report acknowledges the benefits of vaccines, it also calls for further inquiry into potential links between vaccines and chronic disease, a view that diverges from scientific consensus.

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics indicates that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl and precursor chemicals led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the U.S., deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths. The study estimates that without China's restrictions, nearly a thousand more Americans would have died from fentanyl overdoses. Despite fentanyl's addictive nature, the study found that users responded to price changes, with a 1% price increase associated with a decrease in the monthly growth rate of fentanyl-related overdose deaths.</p>

          <p>The Senate has blocked California's plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, a move that could impact the electric car market nationwide. This decision, favored by the oil and gas industry and Republicans, nullifies a waiver granted to California under the Clean Air Act, which allowed the state to set stricter emission standards. California leaders vow to challenge the vote, arguing that it hinders the state's efforts to reduce pollution and combat climate change. The vote also prevents California from requiring half of all new trucks sold in the state to be electric by 2035.</p>

          <p>Congress has voted to overturn a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controls toxic air pollutants emitted by industrial facilities, marking the first time Congress has rolled back environmental protections under the law. Environmental groups condemn the vote, warning it could lead to higher pollution levels and harm human health. The move targets a rule finalized late in the Biden administration, which re-imposed regulations on facilities emitting hazardous pollutants. Industry groups welcome the decision, arguing it will reduce compliance costs for manufacturers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are often presented as a secure way to ensure a steady income stream throughout retirement, but whether an annuity can run out of money depends on the type of annuity. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide income for life, while fixed-term annuities pay out for a set number of years. Variable and indexed annuities can be tied to investment performance, and their value can be depleted if the underlying investments perform poorly. Careful planning and understanding the terms of an annuity are crucial to prevent the risk of outliving the income stream. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, they suggest expanding the standard deduction, eliminating the subminimum wage, and increasing the minimum wage as more effective ways to help low-wage workers.</p>

Robert Hersov, a South African businessman, accused the broadcaster of being "Leftist" and "woke" in its coverage, which rejected claims of a genocide. The criticism arose after President Trump highlighted the issue during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Hersov asserted that Trump is "100 per cent right" and that the situation in South Africa is a real threat to minorities and Western civilization.</p>

          <p>A large fire at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol led to the evacuation of pregnant women and babies. The fire, which broke out on the roof, has been extinguished, and the cause is under investigation. The hospital, including the delivery suite, has reopened to women who need to access services, and people with appointments should attend as planned. Some women were temporarily moved to the Bristol University Life Sciences building.</p>

          <h2>Denmark to Raise Retirement Age to Highest in Europe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 14:17:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark is set to have the highest retirement age in Europe after its parliament adopted a law raising it to 70 by 2040. The retirement age at 70 will apply to all people born after 31 December 1970. Since 2006, Denmark has tied the official retirement age to life expectancy and has revised it every five years. Trade unions protested the decision, calling it "completely unfair" and warning that it will deprive people of a dignified senior life.</p>

          <h2>Glastonbury Festival Yurt Glampers Ticketless as Yurtel Goes Bust</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 14:12:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Glastonbury festivalgoers who booked luxury yurt accommodation through Yurtel have been left ticketless and out of pocket after the company went into liquidation. Yurtel, based in Corsham, Wiltshire, ceased trading on 8 May, informing customers that their bookings would not be fulfilled and that money paid "cannot be refunded". Glastonbury Festival has said it has "no involvement with the operation of Yurtel" and that Yurtel had not paid or secured any tickets for the 2025 festival prior to entering into liquidation.</p>
