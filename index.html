        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by water regulator Ofwat, for breaches related to wastewater operations and dividend payments. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for wastewater operation failures and an additional Â£18.2 million for dividend payment breaches. Ofwat's investigation revealed that Thames Water failed to maintain adequate infrastructure and did not offer an acceptable redress package for environmental damages. The company, which serves a quarter of the UK's population, is under scrutiny for sewage discharges and struggling with Â£20 billion in debt, but recently secured a Â£3 billion emergency loan. </p>

          <p>SpaceX's ninth test flight of Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but failed to complete its return to Earth after experiencing a propellant leak. The upper-stage vehicle spun out of control during reentry, causing it to break up due to intense heat, with debris falling into the Indian Ocean. Despite this setback, the flight achieved improvements over previous tests, such as reaching the scheduled engine cutoff and experiencing minimal heat shield tile loss during ascent. Elon Musk indicated that future tests would occur more frequently, but acknowledged that progress has been slower than initially projected. </p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising alarms about potential capital flight from the U.S. and an unwinding of carry trades as long-dated yields approach record highs. Increased yields on Japanese government bonds could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering global financial market instability. Some analysts warn of a possible "global financial market Armageddon" if yields continue to climb, impacting U.S. tech stocks and increasing borrowing costs. Others suggest the carry trade impact may be less severe than previous instances, anticipating a gradual decline rather than a sudden implosion. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are finding it increasingly difficult to do business due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations. An extensive survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China found that nearly three-quarters of companies said it was getting harder to operate in China. The proportion of companies planning to expand operations has also fallen to a record low. However, some European businesses are also buying more components from Chinese companies due to lower prices, making their supply chains more dependent on China. </p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth test flight, although the vehicle successfully reached orbit before encountering issues. An apparent propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin and re-enter Earth's atmosphere at an unfavorable angle, likely disintegrating over the Indian Ocean. Despite this outcome, the mission marked progress, including the first launch of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster. SpaceX aims to apply the data collected to improve Starship's reliability for future missions. </p>

Sir Mark emphasized that without significant investment, there would be no restoration of neighborhood policing or halving of knife crime and violence against women and girls. The Home Office responded by stating it is backing the police with up to Â£17.6bn this year. </p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has temporarily suspended the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students while it prepares to expand social media vetting. This suspension does not affect applicants who already have scheduled interviews. The move is part of the Trump administration's increased scrutiny of visa applicants, and follows other recent actions affecting international students.
