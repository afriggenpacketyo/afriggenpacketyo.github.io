          <p>Three Iranian men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the UK's National Security Act for allegedly assisting Iran. The charges stem from conduct between August 2024 and February 2025, and the men were arrested on May 3. Authorities from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command are leading the investigation, describing it as complex and fast-moving. The three men are currently in custody and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in Bilopillia, north-eastern Ukraine, has reportedly killed nine people and injured seven others. Ukrainian officials have condemned the attack as a cynical war crime, while Russia claims to have targeted a military staging area in Sumy. This incident occurred shortly after the first direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine since 2022, which resulted in an agreement to exchange prisoners of war. The Sumy region has been a site of increased cross-border attacks in recent months, with Ukraine using the area to launch offensives into Russia's Kursk region in August.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary, marking the longest period any reluctant defectors have been held. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, Pyongyang has refused to communicate with Seoul, reflecting strained relations between the two nations. Experts suggest North Korea's silence is a sign of displeasure with South Korea's hard-line policies under its impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. The fishermen's fate remains uncertain, contingent on improved relations between the two Koreas, especially with upcoming South Korean presidential elections potentially shifting the political landscape.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the origins of Indigenous Americans to prehistoric migrations from Asia, occurring approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The research, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. The findings suggest that early settlers split into isolated groups, adapting to diverse environments and shaping the unique genetic traits of modern Indigenous communities. The study highlights the importance of ancestral knowledge for understanding the cultural heritage and health of underrepresented Indigenous populations.</p>

The election's outcome will determine whether the pro-European government led by Donald Tusk can advance its reform plans, which have been hindered by President Andrzej Duda. Tusk's government has struggled to achieve significant domestic progress due to Duda's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post interpreted by Trump supporters as a veiled threat against President Trump. The post featured seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some interpreted as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, but Trump and administration officials rejected his explanation. The incident highlights the ongoing contentious relationship between Trump and Comey, who was fired during the investigation into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russia.</p>

Visibility dropped to zero in some areas, and residents reported feeling the debris in the wind.
