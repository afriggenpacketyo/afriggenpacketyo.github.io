The company, which functions as an "ecommerce accelerator" for over 200 brands, raised $300 million in its IPO, valuing it at approximately $2.5 billion. The debut occurs during a revitalized tech IPO market but also faces uncertainty from global trade tensions and the company's significant reliance on the Amazon marketplace for its revenue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a short-term Republican funding bill aimed at preventing a government shutdown, with the measure now facing significant opposition in the Senate. The bill, which passed by a narrow 217-212 vote, would extend current spending levels until November 21 and includes additional security funding for lawmakers. Senate Democrats have signaled strong opposition, citing the lack of bipartisan negotiation on key priorities, making a potential government shutdown more likely as the deadline approaches.</p>

The 23-year-old edged out Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson for second place in a stunning performance that marked her first individual global podium finish. American Melissa Jefferson-Wooden won the gold, completing a sweep of the sprint titles. Hunt's success is particularly notable following an injury-disrupted period where she balanced her athletic career with her studies at Cambridge University.</p>

          <p>The UK government has returned an Eritrean migrant to France under its new "one in, one out" agreement after winning a significant High Court challenge. The court ruled that the man's removal could proceed despite his human trafficking claim, as France is considered a safe country where he could continue his case. This legal victory is a key step for the government's strategy to deter small boat crossings, contrasting with the previous Rwanda plan which was blocked by the Supreme Court over safety concerns.</p>

          <p>British retailer Marks & Spencer has launched a new, limited-edition grape variety called Boombites Red Berry Grapes, which is being promoted as a potential 'superfruit'. The result of a natural cross between a table grape and a red wine grape, Boombites have a deep red pulp rich in antioxidants like resveratrol and anthocyanins. Dietitians suggest these compounds may offer health benefits, including supporting gut health, boosting immunity, and reducing inflammation. The grapes are being marketed as a nutrient-dense addition to a healthy diet.</p>

          <p>Jamie Hepburn, the Scottish government's minister for parliamentary business, has resigned from his position following an accusation of physical assault. The complaint was made by Conservative MSP Douglas Ross, who alleged Hepburn grabbed him and swore aggressively after a dispute in the Holyrood chamber. In his resignation letter, Hepburn stated that he had not acted in accordance with his personal code of practice, a decision accepted by First Minister John Swinney. Ross later acknowledged that Hepburn had personally apologized.</p>

          <p>A police pursuit in Jacksonville, Florida, ended dramatically when a state trooper used his vehicle to ram a fleeing motorcyclist. Dashcam footage shows the trooper intentionally colliding with the motorcycle in a residential area, knocking the rider to the ground and preventing his escape. The video highlights a forceful tactic for ending a high-speed chase involving a two-wheeled vehicle. The suspect was wearing minimal protective gear during the pursuit, which snaked through neighborhood streets before the tactical intervention by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Him," produced by Jordan Peele and directed by Justin Tipping, explores the intersection of football and religion through a sinister lens. Marlon Wayans plays a legendary quarterback who mentors a rising college star, played by Tyriq Withers, at his intimidating desert estate. The article praises the film's stylish visuals, menacing production design, and thundering score, comparing its ambitions to a satanic-tinged version of "Rosemary's Baby." However, it criticizes the plot as underdeveloped, leaving key character motivations and story points unclear.</p>

          <p>A U.S. vaccine advisory panel, revamped under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has decided against holding a vote that could have delayed the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. Citing inconsistencies in the proposed policy changes, the committee deferred the decision after medical experts warned that altering the decades-old practice of administering the shot at birth would leave infants vulnerable. The panel did, however, unanimously vote to recommend universal hepatitis B testing for all pregnant women during the meeting.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that new AI-powered companion devices, such as the startup "Friend," represent Silicon Valley's attempt to solve the loneliness epidemic with the very technology that fuels it. The author contends that for decades, digital technologies have replaced genuine in-person interactions with shallow substitutes, contributing to social isolation. Instead of fostering human connection, AI friends offer a simulated, self-flattering version of companionship that may further erode the skills needed for real relationships, likening the strategy to a polluter selling water purifiers.</p>

          <p>Mark A. Welsh III, the president of Texas A&M University, has resigned following a controversy sparked by a student's viral complaint about "gender ideology" being taught in a children's literature course. The incident led to the firing of the instructor and the dismissal of a dean and department chair. Welsh, a retired four-star general, had been leading the university since 2022. His resignation was accepted by the university's chancellor, who agreed it was the "right moment for change" for the institution.</p>

          <p>Authorities have released new details about the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, including text messages that may point to a motive. The suspect, Tyler Robinson, allegedly told his roommate he had "enough of his hatred" and that "some hate can't be negotiated out." Prosecutors revealed that Robinson had become more left-wing and pro-trans rights over the past year, according to his mother. Engraved shell casings found at the scene contained references to video games and online memes, adding a complex layer to the investigation.</p>

          <p>A small group calling itself the "Kingdom of Kubala" has been served a second eviction notice after relocating their camp in the Scottish Borders. The group, led by individuals who have styled themselves as a king and queen, was first evicted from private land near Jedburgh. They then moved to a nearby site which was found to be on council-owned land, prompting Scottish Borders Council to initiate new legal action. The group, which claims ancestral rights to the land, has been ordered to leave by Monday.</p>
