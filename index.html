          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 18:26:45 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports starting August 1. The decision was explicitly linked to the ongoing prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which President Trump described as a "Witch Hunt." The administration also cited an "unfair trade relationship," despite official data showing a U.S. goods trade surplus with Brazil. This move is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to influence both international trade and the domestic political affairs of other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposal to levy a 50% tariff on copper imports has sparked warnings from economists about potential price hikes for consumers. Copper is a critical component in numerous products, including electrical wiring, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. Experts caution that such a significant tariff could fuel inflation by increasing manufacturing costs, which would likely be passed on to consumers. The administration argues the measure is necessary to bolster domestic production and enhance national security, while some analysts suggest it may be a tactic to gain trade concessions.

          <p>A 29-year-old former physical education teacher in the United Kingdom has been charged with 13 sexual offenses involving three children. The alleged crimes, which include sexual activity with minors and producing indecent images, reportedly occurred over a three-year period. The accused, who taught at two different schools, appeared in court and was granted bail with conditions prohibiting unsupervised contact with anyone under 16. The case has been escalated to the Crown Court for a future hearing, highlighting a concerning trend noted in the article of similar cases involving educators.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, briefly exceeding $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in the technology sector led by Nvidia. The cryptocurrency's movement demonstrated its continued correlation with risk-on assets, as investor optimism in tech stocks appeared to spill over into the digital asset market. Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs recently, the price had been trading in a narrow range before this latest breakout. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential crypto-friendly legislation could fuel further upward momentum for the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former chairman of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced his defection to the rival Reform UK party. In a statement, Berry criticized the political establishment, stating that "Britain is broken" and that both the Conservative and Labour parties share the blame. He is the fourth former Conservative MP to join Nigel Farage's party in recent weeks, signaling growing momentum for Reform UK. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative party and prompted Labour to link Reform UK with the "reckless economics" of the Liz Truss government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued letters to more than 20 countries, including major trading partners like Japan and South Korea, threatening to impose steep new tariffs by August 1. The proposed rates range from 20% to as high as 40% for nations like Myanmar and Laos. This action follows the expiration of a 90-day "pause" on previously announced tariffs, with the president now setting a firm deadline for implementation unless new trade deals are reached. Economists warn that these wide-ranging duties could trigger another wave of inflation and negatively impact global trade and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to reports of an AI-generated voice impersonating Senator Marco Rubio to contact high-level officials, The Atlantic published a satirical article listing signs that a caller is an impostor. The piece humorously suggests an impostor might be identified by their "strong backbone," their belief in due process for all, or their expression of guilt over the impacts of U.S. policy decisions. The satire uses dark humor and references to the senator's political stances and public moments to comment on the original news story. The article serves as a comedic take on the intersection of technology, politics, and public perception.</p>
