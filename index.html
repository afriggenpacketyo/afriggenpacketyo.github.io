The ruling stated Trump exceeded presidential authority by imposing levies on nearly all countries. Investors also monitored developments in India-China relations, alongside Alibaba Group's stock surge after strong quarterly results. China's August manufacturing data release was also anticipated, contributing to market movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge intervened to block the Trump administration's effort to deport unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children, just as planes were preparing for takeoff. U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order, citing concerns that the government was circumventing legal protections for these minors. Lawyers argued the children could face abuse or persecution if returned, while the Justice Department claimed the repatriations were for family reunification. This ruling ensures the children remain in U.S. custody for now, allowing for further legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration significantly redecorated the Oval Office, applying numerous "Trump touches" including extensive gold detailing on ceilings, door frames, and cherubim. This aesthetic shift, which Trump personally funded, has sparked varied reactions, with some seeing it as a symbol of a new "golden age" and others criticizing it as "vulgar" or "gaudy." The article highlights how this makeover, alongside an increased number of presidential paintings and personal memorabilia, continues a tradition of presidents personalizing the space, albeit with a unique and highly visible style.</p>

          <p>An aid flotilla, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, has set sail from Barcelona bound for Gaza, aiming to deliver humanitarian aid and challenge the ongoing blockade. Organizers state the mission, involving at least 20 vessels, seeks to "open a humanitarian corridor and end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people." This marks Thunberg's second attempt to reach Gaza, emphasizing the dire humanitarian situation and global silence. The Spanish government has pledged diplomatic protection for its citizens involved, as famine was officially confirmed in Gaza in August, though Israel disputes the report.</p>
