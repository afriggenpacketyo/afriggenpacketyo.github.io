          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Chemotherapy May Inadvertently Promote Cancer Metastasis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy can sometimes awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings focus on breast cancer, explaining why some patients experience metastasis despite successful primary tumor treatment. The research team also identified drugs that, when used with chemotherapy in mice, could inhibit this process. A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with human breast cancer patients, offering potential new strategies to improve treatment outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has indicated that thousands of Afghans whose personal data was leaked in February 2022 will not receive compensation. The breach exposed the details of over 19,000 individuals who had applied for relocation, many of whom now fear retribution from the Taliban. The MoD stated it would "robustly defend" against legal claims, citing an independent review which concluded it was "highly unlikely" that being on the leaked list would directly lead to an individual being targeted. This decision comes despite ongoing lawsuits and concerns for the safety of those still in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid fears he might flee the country while facing trial. Bolsonaro is accused of orchestrating a coup plot to overturn the 2023 election results, charges he denies. The judge also restricted his communication and social media use. The case has drawn international attention, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling it a "witch hunt" and threatening tariffs, leading to a diplomatic spat and visa revocations for Brazilian judicial officials.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning for severe thunderstorms and torrential rain, with a risk of dangerous flash flooding. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to likely road closures, transport disruption, and power cuts. This severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground parched and hard, which ironically increases flood risk as the dry soil cannot absorb the sudden downpour. The warning covers a significant area including London and the south coast.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the complete elimination of its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific division. The move is part of a broader reorganization and is expected to impact over 1,500 employees, including many leading scientists, and save nearly $750 million. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the reduction will help the agency better deliver on its core mission, but critics, including former EPA officials, warn the cuts are dangerous and will dismantle a world-renowned research organization, leaving the public more vulnerable to pollution.</p>

          <p>Scientists with the Chinese army have proposed a new electromagnetic railgun design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing model. The current naval railgun, first seen on a ship in 2018, is limited by the weight of the projectiles it can fire. The new proposed design involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single weapon, which would significantly increase bore pressure. This advancement would allow it to fire heavier, 30kg shells at speeds of Mach 7, making it a much more formidable weapon for military applications.</p>

The audit found that even when inspections occurred, documentation was often poor and fines were sometimes improperly reduced.

          <p>President Trump has signed the bipartisan GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue digital currencies backed by the U.S. dollar, aiming to integrate them into the mainstream financial system. Supporters believe this will strengthen the dollar and provide a 21st-century upgrade to financial technology, while critics had initially raised concerns that were later addressed to ensure the bill's passage. The law is seen as a significant victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clear regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins, which are digital tokens pegged to assets like fiat currencies, presents new challenges for anti-money-laundering efforts and cross-border payment systems. The adviser highlighted that the borderless and pseudonymous nature of these instruments requires new regulatory approaches to maintain financial stability. This call for reform comes as the market for stablecoins is rapidly growing and gaining mainstream attention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government will implement a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for most nonimmigrant visitors, including tourists, business travelers, and international students. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is paid upon visa issuance. According to the provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, travelers may be able to have the fee reimbursed after their visa expires if they comply with all visa conditions, such as not working without authorization or overstaying. However, travel and immigration experts are advising clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable due to the expected difficulty in obtaining reimbursements.</p>

          <p>White House physician Dr. Sean Barbabella has diagnosed President Trump with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. The condition, described as "benign and common" in people over 70, occurs when veins struggle to transport blood effectively, causing it to pool. After a full evaluation including ultrasounds, the doctor found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots and declared the president to be in "excellent health."
