          <p>Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, has surpassed Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual, with his net worth reaching $393 billion. This significant increase in wealth is directly linked to a more than 40% surge in Oracle's stock price. The company's shares soared after it released a highly optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, driven by a surge in demand from AI companies for its data centers. Ellison, who serves as Oracle's chairman and CTO, has also been noted for his political alliances and potential interest in acquiring TikTok.</p>

          <p>At least 19 Russian drones violated Polish airspace, prompting a NATO response where Polish and Dutch fighter jets were scrambled to shoot them down. This marks the first instance of NATO fighters engaging potential targets over allied territory.

The event has heightened tensions, with Poland's foreign minister expressing skepticism about Trump's peace efforts with Russia, urging him to back his words with action.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education, under the Trump administration, plans to proactively inform students and families about the risks associated with federal student loans. This initiative aims to improve financial literacy as outstanding student debt approaches $1.7 trillion and default rates remain at record highs. However, experts question the feasibility of this effort, citing recent significant layoffs at the department's Office of the Ombudsman. The move also comes as millions of borrowers face challenges following the repeal of the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan.</p>

          <p>Decarlos Brown, the suspect in the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train, was heard in a recorded jailhouse phone call admitting to the attack. In the conversation with his sister, Brown, who has a history of mental illness, claimed he did not know the victim and that his actions were controlled by "materials" implanted in his brain by the government. Zarutska had fled the war in Ukraine in 2022 for safety in the U.S. Brown now faces both state and federal charges for the seemingly random and unprovoked killing.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for the first time in over a year during a private 55-minute meeting at Clarence House in London. The meeting is being viewed as a potential first step toward reconciliation in their strained relationship. The last face-to-face encounter between them was in February 2024, shortly after the King's cancer diagnosis. Prince Harry has been in the UK for charity events and has publicly expressed a desire for reconciliation with his family, though no meeting with his brother, Prince William, has been indicated.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily paused proceedings on California's request to block the Trump administration from using National Guard troops in the Los Angeles area. The judge, Charles Breyer, cited uncertainty over his authority to rule while the case is on appeal. Previously, Breyer had ruled that the administration's deployment of troops for domestic law enforcement broke federal law, a decision with significant implications for potential deployments in other cities. California is seeking to prevent the extension of the current deployment of 300 troops, which they argue constitutes a form of military occupation.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the tactical principles of England's national football team under new manager Thomas Tuchel, highlighting a more aggressive and risk-taking offensive strategy. After just six games, including a decisive 5-0 victory against Serbia, Tuchel's approach emphasizes direct passing, off-the-ball runs, and empowering wingers in one-on-one situations. The analysis notes the intelligent use of players in their natural positions and pairings of club teammates to build chemistry quickly. While the team's defense against strong, possession-based opponents remains a question, the overall foundation is considered strong ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>Four men have been found guilty of murdering 33-year-old Tony Ferns, who was stabbed in the heart while in his car in East Renfrewshire in 2019.

Robert Park, who planned the attack, believed Ferns was responsible for injuring his disabled brother. The convicted men—Craig Colquhoun, Raymond Platt, Joseph McCulloch, and Robert Park—received sentences ranging from 18 to 23 years for their roles in the murder.</p>

The complaint alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel told one of the agents his own job depended on removing those involved in past investigations of President Trump. The lawsuit suggests the firings were part of a broader purge to punish agents for their work, particularly on cases like the January 6 investigation. The decorated veteran agents argue their terminations were unconstitutional and put national security at risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The typical peak season for U.S. freight imports is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely due to a sustained drop in exports from China. For three consecutive weeks, imports from China have fallen by 27% year-over-year, and ocean freight booking data suggests the usual late-September rush will not occur. This decline is attributed to the ongoing trade war, which prompted an early front-loading of inventory in May, followed by a sharp decrease in orders. As a result, ocean carriers have announced numerous blank sailings for October, reducing capacity and pushing freight rates higher. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that such a strategy has almost no chance of success, as the GOP is unlikely to defy Trump, and could even backfire if Republicans abolish the filibuster for budget bills in response. Instead, the article suggests that if Democrats are to use shutdown tactics, it should be over a more tangible and popular issue like extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. Ultimately, the piece argues that winning elections is the only effective way for Democrats to counter authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Hope, an 11-year-old polar bear at Jimmy's Farm and Wildlife Park in Suffolk, has died after undergoing a necessary dental operation. The park announced that despite the efforts of a large and experienced veterinary team, the bear did not recover from the procedure. Hope had been moved to the park in 2023 along with three other bears after their previous home at a Swedish zoo closed. The park, which features Europe's largest polar bear enclosure, stated that such complex interventions are sometimes a reality of conservation work and that Hope's passing is a profound loss.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that meat from endangered shark species is being sold to U.S. consumers under vague or incorrect labels. Researchers used DNA barcoding on 29 shark products from stores and online, discovering that 93% were ambiguously labeled simply as "shark." The samples included critically endangered species like the great hammerhead and scalloped hammerhead. The study warns that this practice not only harms endangered populations but also poses health risks to consumers, as some of these species contain high levels of mercury and other toxins.</p>

Now 79, Choi was inspired by the #MeToo movement to seek a retrial, and the court has now ruled her actions constituted justifiable self-defense.

The data revealed that prices for services fell by 0.2%, while goods prices saw only a marginal 0.1% rise.
