          <p>A new study reveals that Buddhist and Taoist temples across China have acted as unintentional sanctuaries for thousands of ancient trees for at least 2,000 years.  These temples have protected these trees from deforestation and development pressures. This unique phenomenon highlights the unintended conservation role of religious sites in landscapes heavily impacted by human activity. The research underscores the importance of preserving these historical and ecological treasures.</p>
