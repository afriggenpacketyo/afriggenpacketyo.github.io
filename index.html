          <p>Japan's Meteorological agency confirmed that July 2025 was the country's hottest on record, with average temperatures 2.89 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average. Officials are warning of continued "severe heat" in August, following a trend of record-breaking Julys for three consecutive years. The extreme weather, which included an early end to the rainy season, is also reportedly affecting the nation's iconic cherry blossoms, causing them to bloom irregularly. Authorities have urged the public to take precautions against heatstroke and manage water resources carefully in areas with low precipitation.</p>

          <p>Despite increased aid deliveries and international airdrops, Palestinians in Gaza report a deteriorating hunger crisis, describing the search for food as a "death journey." Residents state that the aid is insufficient and that diplomatic discussions about Palestinian statehood are disconnected from their immediate, life-threatening struggle for survival. The UN humanitarian office reports that over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while trying to access aid since May, with many deaths occurring near distribution sites. Gazans express that political statements are meaningless without tangible changes to alleviate their suffering on the ground.</p>

In separate news, a key railway line between Düsseldorf and Duisburg has reopened following repairs from suspected arson attacks, which police attribute to left-wing extremists. Additionally, a German consumer group has initiated legal action against several budget airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet. The group argues that the airlines' fees for standard hand luggage violate a 2014 European Court of Justice ruling.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has commented on the transfer situation involving star striker Alexander Isak, calling it "complex" and "far from ideal." The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old Swedish international, whom they value closer to £150 million. Isak was absent from the team's pre-season tour, officially due to a minor injury, and has been seen training alone at his former club. Howe admitted he is largely removed from the negotiations and learned about Isak's whereabouts through the media, expressing his hope to see the player in a Newcastle shirt again.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released a jobs report that fell significantly short of expectations. Trump claimed without evidence that the figures were "RIGGED" to make him look bad, a move that critics condemned as politicizing vital economic data and undermining public trust. The report showed only 73,000 jobs were added in July, far below forecasts, amplifying concerns about the economic impact of his tariff policies. The dismissal caused alarm among economists and a sharp drop in US stock markets. (not investment advice)</p>

By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists discovered that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event approximately nine million years ago. This event involved a tomato-like forerunner and a tuberless, potato-like plant. The research, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this ancient hybridization was the key driver for the development of tubers, the edible part that has made the potato a global food staple.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues EU's Trade Deal with Trump is a Capitulation That Must Be Rejected</h2>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian argues that the trade deal negotiated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with the Trump administration is a "humiliation" for Europe. The authors contend that the deal is a one-way street that damages the EU's credibility and economy, giving up leverage without securing meaningful concessions from the U.S. They criticize von der Leyen for blinking in the face of Trump's coercive tactics and urge EU governments and the European Parliament to reject the lopsided terms. The piece concludes that Europe must course-correct to salvage its interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla liable in a 2019 fatal crash and ordered the company to pay $243 million to the family of the deceased victim and her injured boyfriend. The jury determined that Tesla was partly responsible because its Autopilot technology failed to prevent the collision, which occurred after the driver became distracted looking for a dropped phone. The plaintiffs' attorney argued that Tesla deliberately chose not to restrict Autopilot's use to controlled-access highways, despite designing it for such environments. Tesla has called the verdict "wrong" and plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Two men from Los Angeles County have been charged with murder for allegedly running an illegal cannabis extraction business where five workers died in two separate incidents. Prosecutors state that Ted Chien, 53, and Han Quan Jiao, 55, operated multiple illicit labs. Four workers were killed in an explosion at a warehouse in Irwindale in 2023, and a fifth died in a fire at a South El Monte lab a year later. The district attorney's office accused the men of recklessly prioritizing greed over safety. If convicted, Chien could face the death penalty, while Jiao could face a life sentence.</p>
