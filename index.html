          <p>Russia's Kremlin strongly rejected President Trump's recent criticisms regarding Moscow's military capabilities in Ukraine and its economic health, following Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Trump had suggested Ukraine could reclaim all seized territory and labeled Russia a "paper tiger" facing significant economic difficulties. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov countered this, asserting that "Russia is a real bear" and maintains macroeconomic stability despite global economic disorder and numerous sanctions. He affirmed that Russia's "special military operation" would continue to achieve its initial goals, noting that while Trump's rhetoric shifted, there was no indication of a change in U.S. policy, and the relationship between the leaders remained friendly.</p>

          <p>Lithium Americas' stock soared nearly 80% following news that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This proposal emerged as Lithium Americas renegotiates a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. The administration aims to create a cash buffer and mitigate taxpayer risk by taking a small equity share. This action marks the White House's latest effort to secure direct ownership in mineral supply chains critical to U.S. interests, with the Thacker Pass project poised to become a significant North American lithium source for electric vehicle batteries.

          <p>A shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas resulted in one person dead and two critically injured, with authorities confirming the shooter also deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suspect reportedly opened fire on the government building from an adjacent location. This tragic event is the latest in a series of attacks on ICE facilities across Texas, prompting strong condemnations from officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance, who emphasized the need to stop the rising violence against law enforcement. Federal and local agencies are collaborating on the investigation to determine the motive behind this incident.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is offering special financing to consumers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620, for its F-150 pickup trucks, aiming to boost sales before the third quarter concludes. This strategy provides lower interest rates usually offered to buyers with better credit, making vehicles more accessible and helping to manage inventory levels. While not uncommon, the move targets a demographic with higher default risk, particularly in an uncertain economic climate. Ford Credit asserts it finances only creditworthy customers, utilizing its own scoring model that extends beyond FICO scores to assess eligibility for these promotional rates.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a critical letter to Rolex, questioning if the company's invitation to President Trump at the U.S. Open was an attempt to curry favor and secure lucrative tariff exemptions for its products. Warren suggested Rolex might be adopting a strategy similar to Apple and Nvidia, which have made domestic investments since Trump re-entered office. The article highlights that Trump previously announced a significant 39% levy on Swiss exports, impacting the watchmaking industry. Warren expressed concern over the timing of Trump's presence in Rolex's midcourt box, implying a potential link to his record of doling out special treatment.</p>

          <p>Republicans on the Small Business Committees are actively working to eliminate Biden-era rules that mandate 10% of federal contract resources for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Senator Joni Ernst's proposed INNOVATE Act seeks to ensure grants are awarded solely based on merit, not political or DEI factors. This legislative push coincides with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's expressed concerns to Maryland Governor Wes Moore regarding the state's approach to awarding contracts for the Francis Scott Key Bridge rebuild, warning against using race and sex as criteria. The article underscores a significant ideological debate over DEI's role in government contracts and major infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>The remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman found dead in 1946, were exhumed in Oregon this week as officials aim to solve the state's oldest unidentified person case. The victim, believed to be 30-50 years old, suffered blunt-force trauma and was dismembered, with her remains discovered in burlap sacks along the Williamette River. After critical evidence went missing in the 1950s, the case stalled for decades. The Oregon State Police's Human Identification Program recently located her likely burial site, and the exhumation will allow for advanced forensic testing, hoping to finally identify her and bring resolution to the nearly 80-year-old mystery.</p>

Factors contributing to this cautious outlook include looming tariffs, persistent inflationary pressures, and companies increasingly relying on automation and permanent staff.

          <p>President Trump's recent UN General Assembly speech was met with serious silence and stony faces from delegates, a notable departure from the laughter his 2018 address elicited. Psychologist Peter Collett observed that Trump has evolved into a "global entity," leading his pronouncements to be taken more seriously due to widespread concerns about his erratic actions. The article highlights that Trump's body language, consistently designed to project dominance and immovability, remained evident even during his inflammatory remarks on immigration and climate change. This muted audience response is seen as a reflection of a changed political zeitgeist, where world leaders are more acutely aware of the gravity of Trump's statements and the implications of their own reactions.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the league could begin renegotiating its media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. This move could add billions to the NFL's revenue, contingent on agreement from current partners like Disney, Comcast, Paramount, Amazon, and Fox. The article notes the NFL's content dominates traditional television viewership, making early renegotiation attractive for both the league and its partners seeking extended control. Goodell indicated the changing media landscape incentivizes flexibility, potentially allowing the league to secure new deals and explore partnerships with emerging platforms like YouTube and Netflix.

          <p>A Lowy Institute study reveals China has emerged as Southeast Asia's leading external partner, leveraging its economic clout to become the most influential power in six of the region's eleven countries. With an overall influence score of 65 out of 100, China now surpasses the United States. The report notes that while the region is actively diversifying to mitigate dependence on any single power, numerous nations remain significantly exposed to China in crucial sectors such as trade, investment, and tourism. China currently serves as Southeast Asia's primary export market, absorbing approximately 20% of all exports, and is responsible for about 26% of the region's imports.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Addie E. Citchens's debut novel, "Dominion," which portrays a fictional Mississippi Delta town steeped in Black church culture and sexual repression. The story follows Diamond and Priscilla, two women linked by their love for the troubled teenager Wonder, as they confront their pasts and his escalating wickedness. The novel delves into how rigid religious directives on sexuality, often preached by Wonder's father, Reverend Winfrey, lead to destructive outcomes. The article highlights a pivotal scene where Wonder's violent reaction to a queer encounter underscores the perils of oppressively regulated desire, ultimately leading to the women seeking liberation from their stifling circumstances.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the importance of asking a financial professional if they are a "fiduciary" to ensure trustworthy financial advice. A fiduciary has a legal duty to act in their client's best interest, unlike those who follow only a "suitability" standard, which merely requires recommendations to be appropriate. Failing to work with a fiduciary can lead to higher-cost investments or products that benefit the advisor more than the client, potentially costing tens of thousands over time. The article advises checking an advisor's Form ADV via the SEC's public disclosure site and seeking fee-only advisors who are fiduciaries 100% of the time. (not investment advice)</p>
