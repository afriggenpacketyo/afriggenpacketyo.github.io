          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have secured their first World Series berth since 1993 after defeating the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in a decisive Game 7 of the ALCS.

          <p>Attorneys for Illinois and Chicago have asked the Supreme Court to uphold a lower court's order preventing the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard into the city. In their brief, they argue the administration's request relies on "mischaracterizations" of the situation and that state and local law enforcement have effectively managed protest activities. They contend that federalizing the guard without allowing deployment into Chicago respects the constitutional balance of power between federal and state governments. The state's attorney general emphasized the potential for irreparable harm if the current injunction is lifted.</p>

          <p>Myles Connor, a notorious American art thief, commented on the recent heist at the Louvre Museum, suggesting the perpetrators will struggle to profit from the priceless artifacts. He explained that the thieves' best strategy would be to wait several years before discreetly approaching the museum through an intermediary to negotiate a reward for the items' return. Connor, who once stole a Rembrandt painting to use as a bargaining chip against his own legal troubles, noted the immense historical and national value of the stolen Napoleonic jewelry. He concluded that the thieves will be vilified by the entire nation for stealing its treasures.</p>

          <p>Following a brazen heist at the Louvre, art recovery experts express grave concerns that the stolen French crown jewels may have already been broken apart, with gems recut and precious metals melted down. This process would make the items untraceable and allow them to be sold for a fraction of their historical worth, potentially fetching up to £10 million on illicit markets. The professional nature of the eight-minute robbery suggests the involvement of an organized crime network. Authorities fear that without a swift recovery, these irreplaceable artifacts, considered part of France's national identity, will be permanently lost to history.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Salt Lake City after an unidentified object struck and cracked the cockpit's multi-layered windshield at an altitude of 36,000 feet. The impact caused minor injuries to the pilot, who was treated upon landing. Aviation experts consider the event highly unusual, as bird strikes are rare at such high altitudes, prompting speculation about other potential causes like a drone or weather balloon. The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the incident and examining the damaged windshield to determine the object's origin.</p>

          <p>The WWE World Heavyweight Championship has been officially vacated following an injury sustained by Seth Rollins during an event in Australia. On "Monday Night Raw," general manager Adam Pearce made the announcement, setting up a new title match between CM Punk and Jey Uso to be held at the upcoming Saturday Night's Main Event. Jey Uso earned his spot by winning a battle royal, from which key members of the Vision faction were barred. The development leaves the championship picture open while Rollins recovers, with his return anticipated around WrestleMania 42 season next year.</p>

          <p>A theory termed "winology," originating from Chinese academics, is gaining traction on social media, positing that the West unfairly dismisses China's technological and economic achievements due to hierarchical thinking. The concept suggests a perceived global ranking of peoples that places Chinese individuals in a lower tier, thus preventing objective recognition of the nation's advancements. This viewpoint is now receiving serious academic consideration, with institutions like Wuhan University and Fudan University hosting seminars and dedicating journal issues to its discussion. The theory aims to foster a deeper intellectual conversation about global perceptions and national success.</p>

The pact's first pillar involves Australia purchasing several US Virginia-class submarines before jointly developing a new model. The second pillar focuses on collaboration in advanced military technologies like AI, hypersonic missiles, and undersea robotics, strengthening the trilateral alliance.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: How a US Rule Change on Trade Blacklists Heightened Tensions with China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent change to the rules governing the U.S. Department of Commerce's "entity list" has significantly escalated trade tensions with China. The new regulation expands the criteria for blacklisting companies, effectively increasing the number of sanctioned entities by potentially thousands, many of which are Chinese. This move is viewed by Beijing as a major provocation, predating its own expansion of rare earth export controls. The Bureau of Industry and Security's blacklists are used to identify companies Washington considers a national security threat, and this rule change closes what U.S. officials described as a loophole in the system.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, 82, has finished a course of radiation therapy for an aggressive, high-risk form of prostate cancer that was diagnosed in May. The treatment was administered at the University of Pennsylvania's Radiation Oncology clinic. His daughter, Ashley Biden, shared a video of him ringing a bell at the clinic, a tradition that symbolizes the end of a treatment phase, and expressed gratitude to the medical staff. This follows a separate procedure in September to remove skin cancer lesions. Biden is scheduled to receive a lifetime achievement award in Boston later this week.</p>

          <p>St. Johns, Michigan, a city of 8,000 people, has begun regulating the use of golf carts on public roads due to a boom in their popularity for local transportation. With an estimated 2,000 carts in the city, officials have implemented new rules for safety, including restricting them to streets with speed limits of 25 mph or less. The ordinance also requires carts to pass inspections for signals and horns, and mandates that drivers be at least 18 years old with a valid license. This local action reflects a growing trend across the country as more communities adapt to non-traditional vehicles sharing the road.</p>

          <p>The ghostwriter of Virginia Giuffre's memoir stated that Giuffre would have considered Prince Andrew giving up his royal titles to be a significant victory. The book, released posthumously, details Giuffre's allegations of being trafficked to the prince by Jeffrey Epstein, which Andrew has consistently denied. The co-author, Amy Wallace, emphasized that Giuffre's goal was to hold all the men involved accountable for their actions. She further suggested that if Prince Andrew genuinely feels remorse for the suffering of Epstein's victims, he should cooperate with investigators by sharing what he witnessed during his time in Epstein's circle.</p>

          <p>Childhood peanut allergy rates have dropped by approximately 43% since medical guidelines were updated to recommend early exposure to the allergen, according to a new study. Research published in 2015 found that feeding peanut products to high-risk babies significantly reduced their allergy risk, reversing decades of advice to avoid such foods. This real-world data, analyzing health records of nearly 120,000 children, confirms the effectiveness of the new approach, with an estimated 40,000 children avoiding a peanut allergy diagnosis. Experts are hailing the findings as a major public health success and a call to continue improving allergy prevention strategies.</p>

Despite ongoing issues like homelessness, crime rates are down, tourism is rising, and venture capital funding in the Bay Area's AI sector is set to break records. Local officials, including the mayor, have pushed back against the need for federal troops, highlighting the success of local law enforcement.

          <p>A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud infrastructure provider, caused widespread disruptions across the internet, affecting numerous major websites and online services.

While services were gradually restored throughout the day, the event highlighted the internet's heavy reliance on a small number of dominant cloud providers.

The protests, which were geographically widespread and largely peaceful, serve as a visible counter-narrative to the administration's claims of unstoppable momentum. While not expected to produce immediate policy changes, the movement provides an outlet for dissent and may influence wavering political allies and voters. The large, energetic crowds are seen as an antidote to political despair and a sign of a re-energized opposition ahead of future elections.</p>

This has created uncertainty for over 40 million recipients who rely on the aid for groceries.

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a ruling that temporarily permits the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. The decision is a legal victory for the president, who has asserted the authority to send federal forces to cities to protect federal property amidst protests. The state of Oregon had challenged this authority, with its attorney general warning that the ruling, if it stands, could grant the president unchecked power to place soldiers on American streets. The ruling comes as the administration continues to deploy federal agents to various Democratic-led cities across the country, sparking legal and political battles.</p>
