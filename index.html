        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC report reveals that prior to the Nottingham attacks where Valdo Calocane killed three people, two other men with paranoid schizophrenia, Josef Easom-Cooper and Junior Dietlin, committed similar stabbings while under the care of the same NHS trust. Shelly Easom, Josef's mother, expressed feeling "ashamed" that her son stabbed someone and stated that mental health services failed her son and his victim. The report highlights concerns about patient discharge policies and risk management within the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, suggesting that the trust's failures to learn from previous incidents may have contributed to the subsequent killings by Calocane, and that mental health services let down both her son and his victim. An inquiry is underway to prevent similar incidents. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a black-tie dinner for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, raising ethical questions about potential pay-for-play arrangements. Critics argue that Trump and his family are improperly benefiting from his position of power, with investors spending millions to gain access to the event and potentially influence policy. The gala occurred amid debates in Congress about cryptocurrency regulations, with concerns raised about Trump's potential conflicts of interest. While some investors, particularly foreign-based ones, saw the event as an opportunity to engage with the president, others faced significant financial losses from the volatile meme coin market. </p>

          <p>Bitcoin mining operations are causing a backlash in rural areas that supported Donald Trump, due to the noise and environmental impact of these energy-intensive facilities.

Similar conflicts have emerged in other states, leading to moratoriums and noise limits on mining activity. Trump's support for the crypto industry is clashing with the concerns of local communities, potentially derailing his crypto dreams in his own backyard. </p>

Amazon urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, asserting that the current policy enables the board to determine the appropriate leadership structure based on the company's evolving needs.

Experts emphasize the need for heightened security measures at faith-based communities due to increased threats. Officials believe the suspect acted alone, and the investigation is ongoing.
