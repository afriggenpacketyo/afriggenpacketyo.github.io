          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics found a significant increase in firearm-related deaths among children and teens after 2010, following a Supreme Court decision that granted states more power to set their own gun laws. States with more permissive gun laws experienced over 6,000 excess deaths, while states with stricter laws saw significant drops in pediatric gun deaths. Firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and teens in the U.S., surpassing motor vehicle accidents and cancer. The study emphasizes the need for evidence-based policymaking and tailored approaches to address gun violence.

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl charged with terrorism offences after being groomed online, concluded that there were missed opportunities by authorities to help her. The coroner cited a "systems failure" by counter-terror police and Derbyshire County Council for not referring Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd, the youngest girl charged with terrorism offences in the UK, took her own life in May 2022 after the charges were dropped. The inquest found no organization directly to blame for her death, but highlighted failures in providing mental health support.

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, announced last week, has taken effect, barring nationals from 12 countries and partially restricting those from another seven. The ban, justified by Trump as necessary for national security following a firebombing attack in Colorado, primarily affects countries in Africa and the Middle East. Legal challenges are expected, but scholars note key differences that may make this ban less vulnerable compared to Trump's first-term travel ban. The ban targets the visa application process and includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests.

          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison for attempting to murder a colleague, Graeme Perks, who was a witness against him in disciplinary proceedings.

The judge described Brooks's actions as a "murderous expedition" driven by a "simmering sense of grievance" related to his employment difficulties. Brooks, who was "voluntarily absent" from his trial, will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison. The optimism score is indicative of the severity of the crime and the disruption it caused.

          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained overnight, with all prisoners returned to their cells after officers deployed chemical agents. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their cells, leading to a multi-agency response. Three guards were held hostage but were released safely with no major injuries. One correctional officer received minor injuries and was treated at a hospital. The sheriff confirmed that the prisoners never reached the main fence and posed no threat of escape. The optimism score reflects the successful containment of the riot and the limited injuries sustained. Optimism score is 45</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has largely reversed its cuts to winter fuel payments, raising questions about its spending plans and fiscal rules. The government initially planned to limit payments to pensioners receiving pension credit, but will now provide them to all pensioners, clawing it back in the following tax year from individuals earning Â£35,000 and above. This change will cost Â£1.25 billion, a saving of Â£450 million relative to a system in which all pensioners were eligible to receive the payments. However, analysts suggest the net saving could be lower due to increased pension credit claims. The optimism score reflects the government's attempt to balance financial stability with support for pensioners. Optimism score is 50</p>
