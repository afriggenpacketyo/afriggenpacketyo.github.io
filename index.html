          <p>Chinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its stock reach a record high after the successful launch of its new electric vehicle, the YU7 SUV. Priced competitively to undercut Tesla's Model Y in China, the YU7 received over 200,000 pre-orders shortly after its debut. The vehicle boasts a longer driving range than its Tesla counterpart and incorporates advanced AI features, though it reportedly lags in driver-assist capabilities. This launch intensifies the ongoing EV price war in the Chinese market, marking a significant step in Xiaomi's expansion from consumer electronics into the automotive industry.</p>

In a contrasting development, Citibank has upgraded China's 2025 growth forecast to 5%, citing strong exports to regions like Southeast Asia and the European Union which have helped offset a major plunge in shipments to the United States.

          <p>Nike has announced that new tariffs are expected to add approximately $1 billion in costs during the current fiscal year, presenting a significant hurdle to its ongoing business turnaround. The company plans to mitigate these costs over time by adjusting its supply chain, reducing its manufacturing presence in China, and implementing price increases. Despite reporting an 86% drop in quarterly profits due to inventory clear-outs and strategic shifts, Nike's earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street's low expectations. The company is also realigning its focus back to sports and expanding its wholesale partnerships, including a return to selling on Amazon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is advocating for a major legislative package that includes new tax cuts and an extension of lower rates from his first term, alongside increased funding for immigration enforcement. Despite previously setting a July 4th deadline, he made no mention of it in a recent pitch, as the bill faces a potential logjam in the Senate. The proposal is highly divisive, with Democrats criticizing its significant cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which could leave millions without insurance and food assistance.

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated that the 90-day pause on its 'reciprocal tariffs,' which is set to expire on July 9, could be extended. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt stated that the deadline is 'not critical' and that the president could prolong the pause if U.S. trading partners continue to negotiate in good faith. The remarks came as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks. The policy affects about 60 trading partners, including Japan, which faces a potential total tariff rate of 24 percent on its goods. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite his assertions of significant damage to Israeli military targets, reports indicate that Iran's missile attacks resulted in relatively few casualties and limited impact. In contrast, U.S. and Israeli intelligence suggest that retaliatory strikes 'obliterated' Iran's nuclear program, a claim Khamenei dismissed.

          <p>A whistleblower complaint from a former Justice Department lawyer alleges that a top DOJ official, Emil Bove, suggested the administration should consider defying federal court orders to advance its deportation agenda. The complaint details resistance within the DOJ to what the whistleblower saw as efforts to ignore judicial rulings, highlighting the administration's struggle to meet its ambitious and likely unrealistic goal of removing one million people this year. This comes as the administration has already faced accusations of defying court orders in several immigration cases, revealing a deep conflict between its political promises and legal constraints.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin offered a stark critique of her party, describing it as a 'solar system with no sun' due to its internal divisions and lack of teamwork. In a speech outlining a new vision for Democrats, she argued the party is split between those who see the Trump administration as an existential threat and those who view it as survivable. Slotkin urged Democrats to 'get back to the basics' by focusing on pocketbook issues like jobs, housing, and healthcare to address the shrinking middle class, which she called the nation's greatest security threat.</p>
