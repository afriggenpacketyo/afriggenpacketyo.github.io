          <p>The White House is set to host an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event on its grounds next year to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the nation's founding. The plan was announced by UFC President Dana White, a longtime friend of President Trump, who confirmed the event will happen and that he is coordinating the details with the administration. This marks the first time a professional fighting competition will be held at the White House, with discussions suggesting a cage could be built on the lawn to accommodate up to 25,000 spectators. The event is part of a broader series of celebrations planned across the country for the anniversary.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith received significant criticism after she appeared unfamiliar with the term "chain of command" during a press conference. The exchange occurred as reporters sought clarity following President Trump's decision to federalize the city's police force. Mayor Muriel Bowser intervened to explain the new command structure, stating that Attorney General Pam Bondi is acting as Trump's proxy but the department's internal organization remains unchanged. Smith's response prompted widespread mockery online, with many critics linking it to her previous role as the department's chief equity officer and questioning her qualifications for the top position.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly ruled out any peace proposal that involves surrendering the Donbas region to Russia, warning it would create a bridgehead for future attacks. His statement comes as Russian troops reportedly made a significant 10km advance near Dobropillia, a move Zelenskyy believes is intended to create a narrative of Russian strength before President Putin's meeting with President Trump. Zelenskyy expressed frustration at being excluded from the summit in Alaska, viewing the meeting's location on U.S. soil as a diplomatic victory for Putin. He remains skeptical that the talks will yield a positive outcome for Ukraine without its direct involvement.</p>

          <p>Danielle Spencer, the actress who famously portrayed the sharp-witted younger sister Dee Thomas on the 1970s sitcom "What's Happening!!," has died at the age of 60 after a long battle with cancer. Spencer's character was beloved for her memorable catchphrase, "Ooh, I'm gonna tell mama," and her deadpan delivery. Despite a severe car accident during the show's run that caused lifelong health issues, she pursued a different path later in life, earning a doctorate in veterinary medicine from Tuskegee University. She continued to act occasionally, but was primarily known for her advocacy for animals and her resilience through numerous health challenges, including breast cancer.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has reportedly instructed companies to avoid using specific artificial intelligence chips from U.S. firms Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for government and national security purposes. The warning specifically mentioned Nvidia's H20 chip, which was designed to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions. This development follows a White House confirmation that both chipmakers have agreed to give 15% of their China revenues to the U.S. government. The move signals escalating tech tensions and poses a challenge for American chipmakers, for whom China remains a crucial market for AI hardware.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in the United States have unsealed criminal charges against notorious Haitian gang leader Jimmy "Barbecue" Cherizier, who leads the powerful Viv Ansanm gang alliance. The indictment alleges that Cherizier and a U.S. citizen conspired to solicit funds from the Haitian diaspora in America to purchase firearms and pay gang members, violating U.S. sanctions. Cherizier, a former police officer, is accused of numerous human rights abuses, including massacres and kidnappings that have destabilized Haiti. The U.S. is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest, underscoring the international effort to address the country's severe security and humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Shares of Spirit Airlines fell dramatically after the company issued a warning expressing "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operations over the next year. This cautionary statement, known as a "going concern" warning in accounting, comes only months after the budget carrier emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The airline cited persistent adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel, and expects these challenges to continue through 2025. Despite cost-cutting measures like pilot furloughs, the company emphasized a need for more liquidity, signaling severe financial distress for the no-frills airline.</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 33°C (91.4°F) in several locations. The sustained period of hot, dry weather has led to what experts are calling "nationally significant" water shortfalls, causing widespread environmental damage, impacting farms, and increasing wildfire risks. The heat has also disrupted transportation, with rail services facing cancellations and speed restrictions due to soil shrinkage under the tracks. This event underscores growing concerns about the impacts of climate change, as scientists say such heatwaves are becoming hotter, longer, and more frequent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a steady inflation rate providing some relief to consumers, financial analysis suggests that pursuing debt forgiveness remains a critical strategy for many Americans. The core issue is that while inflation is around 2.7%, average credit card interest rates are near a punishing 22%, creating a massive gap that quickly erodes personal finances. The article argues that the current stable economic environment, before potential headwinds like new tariffs take full effect, presents an opportune moment to aggressively tackle high-interest debt. Waiting for external conditions to improve is a gamble, as the opportunity cost of paying high interest rates prevents building crucial savings. (not investment advice)</p>

The stock's decline was largely attributed to a significant shrinkage in its operating margin, which fell from 20% to 2%, primarily due to $145 million in stock-based compensation costs.

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended President Trump's nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) during a contentious press briefing. Leavitt was pressed by reporters about Antoni's previous suggestion to suspend the monthly jobs report due to alleged inaccuracies. She responded that the president wants to ensure the agency produces trustworthy data and that Antoni's idea was a proposal to get the methodology in order. The exchange has fueled criticism that the administration is attempting to politicize a historically independent agency responsible for crucial economic data.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's sweeping plan to address crime and other issues in Washington, D.C., suggests his actions face significant legal and practical hurdles. The president's authority to federalize the city's police force under the Home Rule Act is limited to a maximum of 30 days, which is insufficient time to implement major reforms. Furthermore, his pledges to change local policies on cash bail, immigration, and homelessness fall outside the scope of his emergency powers. Experts predict that once Trump realizes the extent of these limitations, his focus on the city may wane, rendering the effort a largely symbolic exercise.</p>

          <p>The upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to take place in Anchorage, Alaska, a location chosen for its historical significance as a former Russian territory. The primary stated goal of the summit is to discuss pathways to ending the war in Ukraine, a key pledge of Trump's. The meeting follows several rounds of unsuccessful talks and comes as Trump pushes for a ceasefire. However, Ukraine is not expected to attend, raising concerns in Kyiv that critical decisions about its future could be made without its input, particularly regarding potential territorial concessions.</p>

A search of her apartment uncovered over 130 stolen cards, numerous stolen checks, and a loaded, unserialized "ghost gun."

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a significant 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the race for New York City mayor. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% of voter support, compared to 25% for Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, also running as an independent, trails with just 7%. Mamdani's strength is particularly notable among younger voters, though Cuomo maintains an edge with Black and Jewish voters. The results signal a potential challenge for the Democratic party's centrist wing in the city's upcoming election.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers with a significant deposit, weighing the benefits of a $50,000 certificate of deposit (CD) against a high-yield savings account. While high-yield savings accounts may currently offer slightly higher variable interest rates, CDs provide the security of a fixed rate for a set term. This can be more advantageous in the long run, especially if the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates, which would cause savings account yields to fall. The choice depends on a saver's risk tolerance and their outlook on future interest rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

Andrew Barber, who was reported missing on July 31, used his survival skills to build a shelter from moss and sticks and stayed hydrated by drinking pond water. To signal for help, he carved the word "HELP" on a large rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud. A helicopter search team eventually spotted his truck and then found him near his shelter, severely dehydrated but alive. Rescuers noted he was lucky to have been found when he was.</p>

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index report for July showed that overall inflation held steady at an annual rate of 2.7%, with price declines for gasoline and groceries helping to offset increases elsewhere. However, economists point to worrying signs in the underlying data, as "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy, has risen to its fastest pace since February. This increase is particularly evident in goods like household furnishings and apparel, which some analysts attribute to the inflationary effects of the Trump administration's tariff policies. These effects are expected to become more pronounced in the coming months.</p>
