          <h2>Report Reveals Yacht Tragedy Caused by Gust of Wind and Design Flaws</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A British maritime investigation into the sinking of the Bayesian superyacht off Sicily, which resulted in seven deaths, determined that a strong gust of wind likely caused the vessel to capsize rapidly. The report highlights that the yacht's towering single mast, a unique design feature, increased its vulnerability to high winds. The investigation also revealed that a deckhand delayed waking the captain, posting a video of the approaching storm on social media instead. The New York Times corroborated these findings in a prior investigation, noting the yacht's design deviated from others in its series, raising questions about its overall stability.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a 67% reduction in funding for a state initiative designed to support local newsrooms, citing a $12 billion budget deficit. The cuts would reduce the state's contribution to the News Transformation Fund from $30 million to $10 million for the 2025-26 fiscal year. This decision impacts a deal brokered last year with Google, which would have provided nearly $250 million to newsrooms over five years. The proposal comes amidst broader budget adjustments, including reductions in healthcare for low-income undocumented immigrants and overtime for some government employees.</p>

          <p>A drug bust in Northern California led to the rescue of a young spider monkey, now under care at the Oakland Zoo. Solano County Sheriff's deputies arrested Clifford Vincenty and seized methamphetamine during a traffic stop and subsequent search of his home. The search also uncovered two live rattlesnakes and the spider monkey, named Violeta. Zoo officials emphasized the dangers of the exotic pet trade, noting that infant spider monkeys are often captured after their mothers are killed, leading to physical and mental health issues for the animals.</p>

          <p>China Vanke, a debt-laden property developer, has secured a US$215.4 million loan from its largest shareholder, state-owned Shenzhen Metro Group.

          <p>China-Philippine ties are facing a period of uncertainty as Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been unable to diminish the political influence of the Duterte family. Sara Duterte, accused of misusing public funds and plotting against Marcos, is likely to survive an impeachment trial. Preliminary results from midterm elections suggest allies of Marcos secured fewer Senate seats than expected, which could allow Duterte to avoid conviction and remain a potential presidential candidate in 2028. Analysts suggest that Duterte's "pragmatic" stance on China could lead to improved relations if she were to win the presidency.</p>

Others, like Ilse Steenkamp, feel persecuted and believe they should be treated as refugees due to the violence and discrimination they face.

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, dropping by nearly 30,000, signaling progress in combating the opioid crisis. The CDC credited President Trump for allocating more resources to address the drug problem since declaring the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2017. However, this positive trend coincides with proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis. Experts worry that these cuts could undermine the progress made in reducing drug fatalities.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican-controlled legislature has approved a ballot measure that would ask voters to ban abortion again, after the state overturned a near-total ban through a citizen-sponsored ballot measure in November. The measure, set to appear on the ballot in November 2026, would amend the state Constitution to ban abortion except in medical emergencies, or in cases of sexual assault or incest reported to police within 48 hours. This move bucks the trend of voters siding with abortion rights on ballot measures in other states.</p>

Newsom outlined his nearly $332 billion state spending plan, revealing that California is facing a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by a higher-than-expected price tag on the program and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies, Newsom said. Adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027.</p>
