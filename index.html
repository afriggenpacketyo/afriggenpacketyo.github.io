        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Russia's ongoing aggression, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarus are withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention to potentially redeploy anti-personnel land mines. This move aims to create a significant deterrent along their shared borders, forming what some call a new 'Iron Curtain.' While proponents argue the mines are an existential necessity for defense, humanitarian groups express grave concerns, highlighting the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians for decades after conflicts end. The strategy is part of a broader border reinforcement effort including fences, surveillance, and drone defense systems.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued recovery on the mound by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong pitching performance, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his ability to attack the strike zone aggressively in his third start since returning from elbow surgery.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new smoking ban that covers public beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries, aiming to protect children from passive smoking and move towards a 'tobacco-free generation' by 2032. The rules, which went into effect Sunday, impose fines for violations but do not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants. Health officials state that passive smoking kills thousands annually and that over 30% of French adults still smoke. This measure is the latest in a series of anti-smoking efforts, including high taxes on cigarettes.</p>

          <p>A volunteer at a church in Leicester has detailed a harrowing stalking campaign by a lay preacher after he rejected her romantic advances. The harassment escalated from online abuse to real-world threats, with initial complaints to both police and the Church of England being mishandled. The article reveals that the Bishop of Leicester initially dismissed the victim's complaint and accused him of witchcraft before the stalker was eventually convicted. The story highlights the victim's prolonged suffering and the systemic failures within the institutions that were supposed to protect him.</p>

          <p>A major Republican spending package, dubbed the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' narrowly cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate after a prolonged and dramatic vote. Four conservative holdouts ultimately voted to advance the legislation following negotiations with party leadership over deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid. The senators were reportedly promised a vote on an amendment targeting Medicaid expansion enrollees to secure their support for moving the bill forward. Despite this progress, the bill's final passage remains uncertain, with some Republicans still uncommitted and Democrats planning to delay the process. (not investment advice)</p>

The performance by Irish-language rap group Kneecap was also under scrutiny, as one of its members is currently facing a terrorism charge.

This year's themes, such as 'Rise Up: Pride in Protest' in New York, reflect a shift from pure celebration to a renewed emphasis on resistance.

This behavioral shift highlights the pervasive impact of government anti-corruption and austerity campaigns on the daily lives and social habits of public officials across the country.

One case involves a woman who arrived in 1978, married a U.S. citizen, and regularly checked in with authorities, yet was recently detained. Advocacy groups express concern that ICE is rounding up Iranians regardless of individual threat levels, a claim fueled by recent Homeland Security announcements of arrests.

Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Sean Peden notes that while there is theoretical promise, more robust studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend them.

The verdict concludes a six-year legal process for Bernstein's family, who believe their son was targeted because he was gay and Jewish. Woodward, who was linked to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, stabbed Bernstein to death in a local park.

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating and combat rising obesity rates. Under the plan, retailers will voluntarily take steps such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or reformulating products to be healthier. While the government will not impose specific targets, companies will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. The initiative is part of a broader health strategy aimed at reducing pressure on the NHS, as obesity-related illnesses continue to rise, particularly in deprived areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As 'Love Island USA' experiences its most-watched season, it is also grappling with intense cyberbullying directed at its contestants, prompting on-air pleas to stop the harassment. This issue echoes the dark history of the original UK franchise, where the suicides of two former contestants led to a government inquiry into the welfare of reality TV participants. While producers state they have implemented enhanced mental health support, including on-site psychologists, experts argue that the US version may not have evolved its duty of care as much as its UK counterpart.

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric aimed at the judiciary, stating that it can incite threats and violence. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts noted that when judges are drawn into political disputes, there is a risk that individuals may act on the hostile language. Without naming specific individuals, his comments appeared to reference past statements from both President Donald Trump and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, against whom he has previously spoken out. His remarks follow an assassination attempt on Justice Brett Kavanaugh and come as the court navigates highly politicized cases.</p>

President Vucic has accused the demonstrators of being part of a foreign plot to destabilize the country and has so far refused calls for a snap election.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave continues, the article explains the 'urban heat island' effect, a phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Hard, dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and slowly release the sun's heat, while waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning further elevates temperatures. This effect can make city centers up to 10Â°C warmer, increasing health risks like dehydration and heat stroke and trapping air pollution. With global temperatures rising due to climate change and urban populations growing, cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the dangerous impacts of extreme heat.</p>

Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases adult skin cancer risk, and with melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, preventative education is crucial.
