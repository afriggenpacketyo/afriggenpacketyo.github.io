          <p>Following a terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians in Kashmir last month, India launched airstrikes on what it claimed were terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan responded by calling the strikes an act of war and claiming to have shot down five Indian aircraft, which India has not confirmed. Both sides have reported casualties, including civilians, and the exchange has heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors, prompting international calls for restraint, with the Indian military calling their military operation Sindoor, a reference to the red vermilion that Hindu women wear in their hair after marriage.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a boost after the company announced that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the latter half of the year due to a decrease in the availability of compounded alternatives. First-quarter sales of Wegovy fell slightly below analyst expectations due to the presence of copycat drugs in the U.S. market. However, the FDA's decision to remove the drug shortage ruling, which allowed compounding pharmacies to make legal copies, is anticipated to boost sales for Novo Nordisk.</p>

          <p>A new development in far-UVC technology, specifically secondary harmonics, could make it significantly cheaper to produce lamps that can kill airborne pathogens without harming humans. A startup called Uviquity has found a way to create far-UVC light by shooting a blue laser through aluminum nitrate crystals, potentially leading to widespread adoption of this technology in public spaces. While the effects of far-UVC on air quality are still being researched, preliminary studies suggest that it can be used safely in moderation, paving the way for a future where airborne diseases are significantly reduced.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Susan Collins is under increasing pressure to challenge President Trump's policies, particularly as she chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. Despite her potential power to influence federal spending, Collins has been criticized for not fully utilizing her position to counter Trump's actions, especially those affecting her home state of Maine. While Collins has occasionally voiced concerns, she faces a dilemma between appeasing Republican base voters and upholding her reputation as a pragmatist, creating uncertainty about her political future and her effectiveness in Congress.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing electronic warfare devices capable of creating "ghost" fleets of warships to mislead enemy missiles. The technology, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, involves networked jammers that send signals to deceive advanced radar systems. This could trick missiles into targeting phantom vessels, allowing real warships to evade detection, with the People's Liberation Army looking to get the upper hand in a hypothetical naval combat scenario.</p>

          <p>Many Afghans living in the United States are increasingly fearful of deportation under new policies, particularly after the government declined to renew Temporary Protected Status (TPS). With the end of Operation Enduring Welcome and the potential revocation of TPS, many Afghans who fled the Taliban's takeover worry about being sent back to a country where they could face torture or death. Immigration attorneys are advising Afghan clients to avoid public criticism of the current administration, fearing it could lead to revocation of their legal status.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager, has proposed a change to the offside rule to increase goal-scoring in football, suggesting that a player should only be considered offside if their entire body is beyond the last defender. This proposed adjustment is inspired by a similar rule change implemented after the 1990 World Cup, which resulted in more attacking play and goals. Wenger believes this tweak could help restore the balance between attackers and defenders, particularly with the precision of VAR.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strategy of proposing large tariffs and then scaling them back has created a situation where substantial tariffs are becoming normalized. This tactic, known as anchoring, resets expectations and makes the tariffs currently in effect seem more acceptable, despite their significant impact on global trade. While investors have responded positively to any signs of easing trade tensions, the tariffs still in place represent a tax increase for consumers and pose challenges for businesses, particularly small businesses, as the tariffs have created a great deal of uncertainty.</p>
