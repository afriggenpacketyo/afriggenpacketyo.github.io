          <p>Michail Chkhikvishvili, the alleged leader of a neo-Nazi cult called the "Maniac Murder Cult," has been extradited to the United States and faces federal charges for soliciting hate crimes and violent attacks. The Justice Department claims Chkhikvishvili, also known as "Commander Butcher," distributed a "Hater's Handbook" that encouraged school shootings and other mass casualty events. The DOJ alleges that Chkhikvishvili's solicitations of violence have had their intended effect, directly resulting in real violence, including multiple senseless killings in the United States and around the world. One instance cited was the January 2025 shooting at Antioch High School in Nashville, where a 17-year-old student killed one and injured another before committing suicide, with the attacker claiming affiliation with MKY.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the DOGE initiative, led by Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit, arguing that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates. Judge Illston emphasized that Congress creates, funds, and assigns duties to federal agencies, and a President cannot initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress. The Trump administration has appealed the decision.</p>

          <p>Harvard University's foreign students are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration moved to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, citing a failure to adhere to the law. This action follows a growing crackdown by the administration on institutes of higher learning, particularly those with pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard has been given 72 hours to comply with demands, including providing disciplinary records for non-immigrant students. The move has left international students, who make up over 27% of Harvard's enrollment, in limbo, fearing for their ability to continue their studies and future opportunities in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Harvard professor Steven Pinker defends the university against what he describes as unhinged invective, including accusations of being a "national disgrace" and an "Islamist outpost." Pinker acknowledges Harvard's ailments, such as the erosion of academic freedom and a lack of viewpoint diversity, but argues against the Trump administration's punitive measures, including defunding and barring foreign students. He emphasizes the need for a balanced perspective, stating that Harvard, despite its flaws, remains a vital institution for discovering and transmitting knowledge and that the appropriate treatment is to diagnose and remedy specific issues rather than inflict crippling damage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Apple unless the company shifts iPhone manufacturing to the United States. This threat comes after Apple's decision to move part of its supply chain to India. Industry analysts suggest that relocating Apple's supply chain to the U.S. is highly unlikely due to the time, expense, and higher labor costs involved. While final assembly in the U.S. is theoretically possible, it would take years and increase prices for consumers, potentially driving them to cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports on a study published in The Lancet, finding that contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound. While MRI is more effective at detecting tumors, CEM is more cost-effective and can find smaller tumors than standard mammography. The study suggests that CEM should become a standard of care for women with dense breasts at high risk of breast cancer, potentially averting tragedies through early detection. However, CEM is not yet widely used for screening in the United States and has not been approved by the FDA for breast cancer screening.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US wanted to see more concessions from Europe, stating, "I would hope this would light a fire under the EU".

While some analysts believe economic pressures will prevent Trump from pushing Brussels too far, others suggest an EU-US deal appears harder to reach due to the bloc's large goods trade surplus with the US. The EU has already threatened new tariffs on $107 billion of US goods in response to Trump's earlier tariffs, but paused them to allow negotiations to proceed.</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans would significantly weaken electric vehicle (EV) adoption by repealing key subsidies and imposing new fees. The bill aims to eliminate subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for EV purchases, and funding for charging stations. It also includes a $250 annual fee on EV owners. Analysts predict that the bill, if enacted, would slow EV sales and production, putting the United States further behind China and Europe in EV adoption. Environmentalists warn of higher greenhouse gas emissions and dirtier urban air as a result.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee indicated that President Trump's tariff threats have complicated monetary policy, likely delaying interest rate changes. Goolsbee noted that the Fed will remain cautious as it assesses the impact of trade policy on inflation and employment. He expressed concern that tariffs could have a stagflationary effect, making the central bank's job more difficult. Goolsbee still hopes for solid economic growth but acknowledges the uncertainty introduced by trade policy.</p>

          <p>The House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," disproportionately favors high-income households through tax cuts for business owners, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas. According to the Congressional Budget Office, low-income households would see their incomes decline, while the top 10% would benefit from an income boost. Critics argue that the bill's tax cuts are offset by reductions in social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The legislation compounds the regressive nature of the Trump administration's recent tariff policies, economists said.</p>

Failure to seize the moment could lead to a resurgence of the conflict, as happened in 2015. The PKK is expecting political concessions, including amnesty and recognition of Kurdish political and cultural rights.</p>
