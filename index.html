            <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg to discuss a potential resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, as Donald Trump urges Russia to expedite ceasefire efforts. The meeting, which lasted over four hours, focused on "aspects of a Ukrainian settlement". Trump has expressed his discontent with the progress of talks and reiterated his belief that the war would not have occurred had he been president. Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky accused Russia of prolonging the war and alleged the presence of Chinese nationals fighting alongside the Russian army.</p>

            <p>Rafael Osío Cabrices' book, "Venezuela. Memorias de un Futuro Perdido," chronicles the events leading to Venezuela's socioeconomic crisis. The book provides a nuanced understanding of a country that lost a quarter of its population in less than a decade. Osío Cabrices argues that democracy cannot be taken for granted and that people are not very aware of what democracy means. He stresses that democracy is like building a Jenga tower, where any mistake can collapse everything built.</p>

            <p>A US immigration judge sided with Trump administration lawyers, ruling that Mahmoud Khalil can be deported for his views. The Department of Justice was unable to provide a court with information on a wrongly deported man. The US president insisted his tariff war was going “really well” despite mounting fears of recession. Immigration officials attempted to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools, but were turned away by school administrators.</p>

If China can weather this difficult period, it could boost Beijing's confidence in facing potential sanctions in a future cross-strait conflict. The United States has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent.</p>
