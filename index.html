          <p>A Chinese military journal has revealed the development of new unmanned underwater systems designed for stealth and integrated combat operations. According to the publication, these systems operate at extremely low noise levels to evade enemy sonar detection. They can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles, smart mines, and other unmanned vehicles to create a sophisticated, multi-layered strike network. This disclosure highlights China's advancements in disruptive and intelligent underwater warfare capabilities, signaling a strategic focus on enhancing its naval power through autonomous technology.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has placed the national park system in a precarious state, with thousands of employees furloughed and operations severely curtailed. While some parks remain partially accessible using fee revenues, essential services like maintenance and visitor support are largely absent, leading to public confusion and safety concerns. This situation echoes the 2018 shutdown, which resulted in significant environmental damage and waste management issues, raising fears among advocates and park workers about long-term consequences for both the parks and their gateway communities.</p>

          <p>Small college towns across the U.S. are facing significant economic hardship due to a sharp decline in international student enrollment. This downturn is linked to stricter immigration and visa policies under the Trump administration, which have created a climate of fear and uncertainty for prospective students. Universities and local businesses, which rely heavily on the higher tuition and spending from these students, are reporting substantial revenue losses. The trend threatens the economic stability and cultural diversity of communities that have long depended on their academic institutions.</p>

Labor unions emphasize that these low-wage workers are the most vulnerable, as a prolonged shutdown forces them to risk eviction and struggle to afford basic necessities for their families, turning their lives upside down.</p>

          <p>After undergoing an extensive 20-year renovation project, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in Egypt's Valley of the Kings has reopened to the public. The restoration, led by a Japanese team, focused on preserving the intricate paintings depicting the pharaoh and his wife on the tomb's walls. Amenhotep III, one of the most prominent pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty, ruled for nearly four decades. The reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency for the nation's economy.</p>

          <p>Early returns from the Czech Republic's parliamentary election indicate a victory for the right-wing populist ANO party, led by billionaire former Prime Minister Andrej Babis. Projections show ANO winning with 35.5% of the vote, significantly ahead of the ruling center-right Spolu coalition. Babis, who has opposed continued military aid to Ukraine, may align the Czech Republic more closely with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU policies. The result raises concerns in Brussels and Kyiv about a potential shift in Central European geopolitics and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In the new A24 film "The Smashing Machine," Dwayne Johnson delivers a career-defining performance as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, a role that starkly contrasts with his typical blockbuster characters. The gritty biopic, directed by Benny Safdie, chronicles Kerr's rise in the early days of the UFC and his harrowing battle with opioid addiction. While the film's narrative is considered somewhat conventional, Johnson's physical and emotional transformation is being praised by critics as a potential awards contender. Emily Blunt co-stars as Kerr's then-girlfriend, offering a strong supporting performance in the intense drama.</p>

These prosecutions often involve allegations of substance use during pregnancy and utilize laws originally intended to protect children, not fetuses, thereby advancing the concept of "fetal personhood." The author warns that this could lead to increased surveillance of pregnant people and the criminalization of behaviors deemed risky, drawing parallels to the highly restrictive environment in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>A 37-year-old mother, Michaela Del Barrio, was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer after she proactively sought early screening due to her family's history with the disease. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI ordered by a high-risk clinic revealed two suspicious masses. Her experience underscores the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as doctors recommend women with a family history of cancer begin discussions about screening in their mid-20s. Her oncologist credits her awareness with catching the cancer at a highly treatable stage.</p>

          <p>A public dispute between a celebrity influencer and a major restaurant chain has ignited a nationwide debate in China over the use of pre-made and semi-processed foods in the catering industry. The controversy highlights consumer concerns about paying premium prices for meals that are not freshly prepared, putting further pressure on an already struggling sector. While the industry's income has grown, the rate of growth has slowed significantly compared to previous years. This debate comes at a critical time as restaurants look to the National Day holiday week to boost consumption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, adopted a plant-based diet approximately 50 years ago, a decision deeply intertwined with her ethical and environmental activism. She famously stopped eating meat after reflecting on the fear and pain it represented, a choice she said made her feel immediately better and lighter. Goodall was a vocal advocate for plant-based eating, citing the negative environmental impact of factory farming and meat production. Her commitment to her work and diet aligns with traits often observed in the world's longest-living, healthiest people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-held belief in the enduring prestige of top-ranked universities is weakening as families increasingly prioritize practical outcomes like cost, career placement, and hands-on learning. With soaring tuition and a tough job market, many parents are questioning whether a brand name alone is worth the price. This shift is reflected in changing application patterns, with students considering a wider mix of public and private schools, and in the rising popularity of institutions that emphasize experiential learning over historical reputation, reshaping the hierarchy of American higher education.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has presented a "Compact for Academic Excellence" to nine elite universities, offering federal benefits in exchange for adopting a sweeping MAGA-aligned agenda. The document mandates policies on admissions, free speech, tuition, and hiring, effectively stripping the institutions of their independence. If universities refuse to sign, they risk losing federal funding and access to student loans. Critics describe the proposal as an unconstitutional and coercive attempt to bring higher education to heel, comparing its logic to that of a mafia protection racket.</p>
