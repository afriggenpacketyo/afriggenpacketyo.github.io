          <h2>Families of D.C. Plane Crash Victims Urge Aviation Safety Reforms</h2>

          <p>Families of victims from a deadly D.C. plane crash are actively advocating for comprehensive aviation safety reforms in Congress, emphasizing the critical need for robust transportation systems unaffected by government shutdowns. Rachel Feres, who tragically lost four family members in the January collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Eagle flight, has met with lawmakers and the NTSB chair. She is championing legislation that mandates all aircraft, including military, utilize Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) tracking equipment, noting the Black Hawk involved in the crash lacked this. This bipartisan advocacy highlights an urgent push for enhanced safety measures, aiming to prevent future air travel tragedies and restore public trust in the nation's aviation infrastructure, especially given the ongoing investigation into the crash's causes.</p>

          <p>Germany's national football team secured a decisive 4-0 victory over Luxembourg, a much-needed win to get their World Cup qualifying campaign back on track after a troubling start that included an opening game loss to Slovakia. The match, played in Sinsheim, saw Luxembourg reduced to 10 men early on, allowing Germany to dominate and deliver a performance both expected and required. Coach Julian Nagelsmann made tactical adjustments, including moving captain Joshua Kimmich to right-back, while key players like Serge Gnabry and Florian Wirtz showed strong performances, unconcerned by recent critical headlines. This significant result helps Germany greatly in their quest for the top spot in their group, providing a temporary reprieve from recent criticism and growing concerns surrounding the national team's form and public perception.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as Prime Minister, just four days after he initially stepped down, marking a week of significant political turmoil. Lecornu faces the immense challenge of forming a government and presenting next year's budget to parliament by Monday, all while Macron lacks a majority in the National Assembly. France is grappling with a public debt nearing 114% of its economic output and a projected 5.4% budget deficit, which has intensified political divisions and contributed to the fall of two previous prime ministers. Macron's popularity has hit a record low, and Lecornu's reappointment is met with strong skepticism from opposition parties, who view it as a move by an increasingly isolated president, suggesting a difficult path ahead for the new government.</p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran, Joshua Finney, 38, was arrested in Texas after allegedly threatening to carry out shootings at Morton Ranch High School in Katy and the Houston Zoo. Authorities reported Finney sent alarming Facebook messages to a relative, including pictures posing with guns, before leading police on a high-speed car chase where he drove recklessly at speeds up to 110 mph. Upon his eventual stop and arrest, a loaded gun with 39 rounds of ammunition was discovered in his vehicle, and law enforcement also obtained video evidence of him driving by the high school. Finney, who has a lengthy and violent criminal history, is charged with harassment, evading police, and illegally possessing a weapon, with his bond notably raised to $10 million, as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, a newly minted Nobel Peace Prize winner, dedicated her prestigious award to both President Donald Trump and the "suffering people of Venezuela." Machado, a prominent figure in the resistance against Venezuela’s ruling party, publicly praised Trump for his "decisive support" in their ongoing struggle for freedom and democracy, viewing the international recognition as a significant boost to their cause. She has consistently supported the Trump administration's actions against Nicolás Maduro's regime and its narco-trafficking network, previously stating it was time for Maduro "to go." Trump, who was also among the contenders for this year’s prize, has been a vocal critic of Maduro, and the U.S. is among several countries that do not recognize Maduro's government as legitimate.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration immigration official testified in federal court about the complex and ongoing efforts to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year before being returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. The U.S. has engaged in discussions with numerous foreign nations, including Eswatini and Ghana, about accepting him, but neither has yet agreed, with Ghana's foreign affairs minister explicitly refusing. Abrego Garcia's lawyers contend his continued detention is illegal, citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision against indefinite detention and arguing the administration's actions appear "punitive." Adding to the complexity, a federal judge in Tennessee recently suggested the criminal human smuggling case against Abrego Garcia may have been "vindictive," further scrutinizing the government's intentions and legal strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for what the White House described as his "routine yearly checkup," notably just six months after undergoing his annual physical examination at the same facility. The White House declined to elaborate on the reason for this second checkup, although Trump himself characterized it as a "semi-annual physical." This visit is particularly timed ahead of his planned travel to the Middle East, following the announcement of the first phase of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas. While his April physical results showed no major abnormalities, later medical unit findings revealed the president has chronic venous insufficiency, which adds relevant context to this unscheduled medical evaluation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened a "massive increase" in U.S. tariffs on China, accusing Beijing of becoming "very hostile" over its new restrictions on rare-earth elements, which are critical for manufacturing semiconductors, electric car batteries, and defense weapons. China's new export controls, which took effect Thursday, now require special approval for products containing even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths, impacting global supply chains. Trump also explicitly threatened to cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. This aggressive stance reignites trade tensions between the two economic giants, causing U.S. stocks to fall sharply, and signals a potential reversal of the fragile trade détente established earlier this year.

However, Martinez’s lawyer, Christopher Parente, strongly disputes this narrative, claiming that footage from one of the agent’s body-worn cameras contradicts the official account, capturing an officer saying, “Do something, bitch,” before opening fire.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James faces a federal indictment for mortgage fraud, a case legal experts widely dismiss as weak and potentially politically motivated, given President Trump's public calls for her indictment. Career prosecutors initially found no probable cause, but a Trump-appointed interim US attorney proceeded with the case. James is accused of lying on mortgage documents for a second home, then renting it out, allegedly saving her around $18,933 over the loan's life. Legal scholars point out that the mortgage rider she signed did not prohibit renting outright and included an exemption for "extenuating circumstances," such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics highlight the small alleged financial benefit and the unusual nature of such a prosecution, suggesting a vindictive aim rather than legitimate legal grounds.</p>

David Weild, chairman and CEO of Weild & Co., highlights its historical role as a consistent store of value, even dating back to gold-backed bearer bonds in the mid-1800s during periods of high inflation. Gold's enduring ability to preserve purchasing power and offer crucial diversification, often performing well when other assets are under stress, makes it relevant for both seasoned and beginner investors today.

          <p>National Guard troops have commenced patrols in Memphis as part of a federal task force established by President Trump to combat crime in the city, which the administration described as "suffering from tremendous levels of violent crime." The task force, comprising agents from several federal agencies, aims to reduce crime, enforce immigration laws, and assist local police with recruitment and training. While some local leaders and state officials, like Governor Bill Lee, support this federal intervention, critics accuse the administration of unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities and testing the limits of presidential power regarding the use of military force. Governor Lee confirmed that troops would serve in unarmed support roles unless specifically requested by local law enforcement, with the city government's website clarifying their function as "extra eyes and ears" for local and federal agencies on the ground.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan comedian Angelo Colina discusses the political and cultural significance of performing stand-up in Spanish in the U.S., particularly amidst ongoing ICE raids. Colina, inspired by Venezuelan acts who fought censorship, describes his shows as "the closest to punk that we’ve ever been," celebrating Latino culture while acknowledging the challenging climate for immigrants. He notes a shift in his audience, with fewer second-generation Latinos attending due to parents' fears, and recounts emotional goodbyes to audience members facing deportation. Colina emphasizes his commitment to addressing these realities through comedy, viewing it as a way to help his community and navigate the evolving U.S. comedy scene.</p>

          <p>The conservative Parents Television Council (PTC), known for its high-profile campaigns against TV shows deemed too raunchy, has folded after nearly three decades, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Once a powerful watchdog that influenced advertisers and network programming, its demise reflects broad cultural shifts, including the fractured media environment and the consumer migration to streaming and social media platforms, which the FCC does not regulate. Former president Tim Winter expressed disappointment but pride in their achievements, citing fundraising difficulties as the primary reason for the closure. The group's influence waned as its ability to flood the FCC with complaints became less impactful in the new media landscape.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought confirmed that "reductions in force" (RIFs), or federal worker firings, have begun amidst the ongoing government shutdown. This announcement drew sharp criticism from Republican Senator Susan Collins and federal employees' unions, who labeled the actions "disgraceful" and "illegal," and have filed a lawsuit to block the move. The Department of Health and Human Services also confirmed layoffs, blaming a "bloated bureaucracy" from the previous administration. Democrats accuse Trump and Vought of causing "deliberate chaos" by using federal workers as political pawns in the funding stalemate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled the massive Esmeralda 7 solar power project in Nevada, which would have been one of the world's largest, signaling a broader attack on renewable energy initiatives. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) changed the project's status to "cancelled," despite having advanced a draft environmental impact statement earlier under the Trump administration. While the interior department suggested developers could resubmit individual project proposals, critics interpret this as a clear policy move against green energy. This action follows President Trump's executive order pausing new renewable energy authorizations for federally owned land and water, and his appointment of a Colorado-based oil industry trade group president to head the BLM, reinforcing a significant policy shift away from renewables.</p>

          <p>Sir Tony Blair met with Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street while serving as prime minister in 2002, a meeting lobbied for by Lord Peter Mandelson, as confirmed by recently released documents. A memo shows Blair was briefed on Epstein, a "super-rich" financial adviser and friend of Bill Clinton, six years before Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. A spokesperson for Sir Tony stated the meeting was brief, discussing U.S. and U.K. politics, and occurred long before Epstein's crimes were known. The release of these documents, previously blocked, follows fresh revelations about Mandelson's friendship with the disgraced financier, adding to the historical record of Epstein's high-level connections.</p>

Judge Peter A. Hernandez found Bonta had not met the legal grounds to strip local control, citing a lack of clarity in the settlement's tasks.

          <p>The Newville Diner in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, has regrettably closed its doors after three years of operation due to a persistent and unresolvable issue with its well water supply having a bad odor. Owners John Barsoum and Asham Moawad were forced to purchase their own water for the past six months, incurring substantial monthly costs of $6,000 to $7,000, which ultimately proved unsustainable for their family-owned business. Despite this significant setback, the owners have expressed resilience and announced plans to relocate and reopen their business under a new name, Dickinson Family Restaurant, at a new Carlisle location, bringing their dedicated staff with them. This local story highlights the unexpected challenges small businesses can face with infrastructure issues, but also demonstrates an optimistic spirit in planning a new beginning.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's album "The Life of a Showgirl" achieved record-breaking sales, selling over 3.5 million units in a week, a feat attributed to high-pressure sales techniques and intense fan loyalty. The article highlights how modern music success is increasingly tied to popularity as a performance, with artists leveraging "album equivalent units" that prioritize sales over streaming. Swift and her team maximized sales by releasing the album in over 30 "variants" – different formats, art, merch, and bonus music – often with limited-time offers and countdown clocks. This strategy transforms album releases into a consumer game, where fans are encouraged to make multiple purchases, showcasing a shift in the music industry's monetization tactics.</p>

          <p>Turkey is playing a significant and increasingly active role in the new Gaza peace plan, brokered in Sharm el-Sheikh under U.S. President Donald Trump's initiative, despite its relatively late involvement in the negotiation process. Turkish President Recep Erdogan was specifically asked by Trump to help persuade Hamas, with whom Turkey maintains close ties and which it openly supports as a "freedom movement." Turkey's intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin joined the third round of talks, reportedly succeeding in reaching Hamas groups thought to be holding hostages. Erdogan has confirmed Turkey's participation in a task force, potentially involving troops to locate the remains of Israeli hostages, though several details, such as the timeframe and possible Israeli reservations about a Turkish military presence in the region, still remain unclear.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and AstraZeneca have reportedly reached an agreement for the U.K.-based pharmaceutical giant to cut drug prices in the U.S., following a similar pact with Pfizer. President Donald Trump and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot are expected to announce the deal, which includes selling drugs directly to Medicaid patients at "most-favored nation" pricing via a new government website, TrumpRx.gov. This initiative aligns with Trump's push for drugmakers to lower costs and invest in U.S. manufacturing, as he has threatened tariffs as high as 250% if agreements are not met. AstraZeneca had already announced a $50 billion U.S. investment by 2030, reinforcing the administration's efforts to curb sky-high medicine costs for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
