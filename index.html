          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are publicly voicing increasing concerns about the long-term sustainability of Washington's national debt, suggesting that U.S. Treasuries are no longer a risk-free investment. A recent article in a publication supervised by China's central bank stated that while a default has not occurred, the current expansion of U.S. debt is unsustainable. In response to these worries, China has been gradually reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, with its current holdings at the lowest level since 2009. The researchers recommend that China continue to adjust its reserves, potentially increasing its holdings of gold and other strategic resources. (not investment advice)</p>

The accident occurred near the German border when the train collided with a slurry tanker at a level crossing, causing at least two carriages to derail. Emergency services were on the scene, using a crane to lift damaged carriages to search for any additional victims among the 106 people involved. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed her condolences, and rail services along the affected line have been suspended indefinitely.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial test of the engine system for its new Long March-10 rocket, marking a significant step towards its goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2030. The test involved firing 21 YF-100K engines simultaneously, confirming they could operate in sync under various power conditions and providing essential data for the program. The superheavy Long March-10 rocket is designed to be powerful enough to send a 27-tonne payload into a trans-lunar orbit. China's lunar mission plan involves using two of these rockets to separately launch the Mengzhou crewed spacecraft and the Lanyue lander for a rendezvous in lunar orbit.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded a high-stakes summit in Alaska, which Trump described as "productive" despite failing to secure a breakthrough or ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. Putin characterized the talks as a "starting point" for improving U.S.-Russia relations, which he said are at a low point, and proposed a future meeting in Moscow. The White House had initially downplayed expectations, calling it a "listening exercise," and key details of the discussions remained vague, with Trump deferring next steps to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European allies. The meeting was notable as Putin's first visit to the U.S. in nearly a decade.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, portraying it as an event where Trump was deferential to the Russian leader. The author notes the optics of the meeting, from the red-carpet welcome to Putin endorsing Trump's claims about the 2020 U.S. election being "rigged." The piece argues that Putin achieved a significant diplomatic victory by being welcomed back onto the world stage without offering any tangible concessions on the war in Ukraine. The summit is framed not as a negotiation between equals, but as a moment that reinforced authoritarian narratives and yielded little for U.S. or Ukrainian interests.</p>

          <h2>Five Key Takeaways from the Trump-Putin Summit in Alaska</h2>

          <p>The BBC article breaks down the Alaska summit between Presidents Trump and Putin into five main observations, highlighting the lack of a concrete ceasefire deal as a primary outcome. Key takeaways include Putin's successful return to the world stage, marked by a red-carpet welcome on U.S. soil, and the vagueness of the leaders' post-meeting statements. The analysis points out that while Putin hinted at eliminating the "root causes" of the conflict—implying maximalist demands—Trump did not mention Ukraine at all in his public remarks. The summit is characterized as yielding more questions than answers, culminating in Putin's invitation for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is implementing significant changes to its residency rules for mainland Chinese nationals, a move described by some as an "attack" on cross-strait spouses. The new policy, driven by concerns over security risks and Beijing's influence, requires applicants to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. President Lai Ching-te's administration has cited threats like societal infiltration and identity ambiguity as reasons for the stricter measures. This marks one of the most substantial shifts in cross-strait residency governance in recent decades, reflecting a strategy to eliminate dual-status ambiguities that Taipei views as a potential threat.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, allowing them to move back into a tie for first place in the National League West.

Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, and the bullpen successfully protected a narrow lead, a task they had struggled with recently. The game, held on "Demon Slayer Night" at Dodger Stadium, was seen as a significant moment for the team to halt their slide and reassert their position in the division race.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump revealed in a Fox News interview that a potential land swap between Ukraine and Russia was a key topic of negotiation. Trump stated that points regarding territorial exchanges and U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine outside of NATO were "largely... agreed on" during the talks. He emphasized that the meeting was "very warm" and that the two sides were "pretty close to a deal." However, Trump also acknowledged that the final agreement is contingent on Ukraine's acceptance, noting that Kyiv "has to agree with it" and could potentially reject the proposal.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps in a bid to gain up to five additional U.S. House seats. This move is positioned as a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas, with both parties vying for control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. If passed, the new maps would significantly reshape several GOP-held districts to favor Democratic candidates, potentially reducing the Republican House delegation from the nation's most populous state to just a handful of members.</p>

          <p>This analytical article from The Atlantic argues that the Alaska summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin was a strategic victory for the Russian leader, who left with his objectives intact while Trump appeared empty-handed. The author notes that despite the high-stakes context of the Ukraine war, the meeting produced no tangible agreements or "deliverables," leaving allies in Europe and Kyiv guessing about what was discussed privately. The piece contrasts the event with the controversial 2018 Helsinki summit, concluding that while Anchorage was less overtly damaging, Putin successfully used the platform to regain international legitimacy without making any concessions. The summit is framed as a spectacle that ultimately bought Moscow more time to continue its war efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) following a lawsuit filed by the city. A federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the initial order, which had placed the DEA administrator in command of the local police force. Under the new agreement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain control of the MPD, while the federal government can still direct the department to assist with federal matters, such as immigration enforcement. The resolution came after D.C. officials legally challenged the move, which they had labeled a "hostile takeover" and an abuse of federal authority.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," meticulously planned his prison escape over six months. Hardin stated that "very lax" security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out of the facility. The report details numerous security failures, including an unsupervised dock and a guard opening a gate without confirming identity, which have led to two employees being fired. Hardin survived in the woods for nearly two weeks before being recaptured a short distance from the prison.</p>
