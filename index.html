          <h2>Aston Villa to File Complaint Over Referee Selection in Loss to Manchester United</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 15:37:31 EDT</div>

          <p>Aston Villa plans to lodge a formal complaint with the Premier League regarding the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their recent match against Manchester United, which they lost 2-0. Villa's director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, expressed concern that Bramall, deemed one of the league's most inexperienced referees, was assigned such a crucial game, especially considering Champions League qualification implications. The complaint is not about the specific decisions made during the game, including a disallowed goal and a penalty, but rather about the perceived lack of experience of the referee in such a high-stakes match. Villa manager Unai Emery acknowledged the mistakes but emphasized the need to accept them, highlighting the significance of the referee's decisions on the game's outcome.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Kate Shaw discusses the Supreme Court's recent unsigned order that effectively allows President Trump to remove high-level officials who are typically protected from being fired at will. Shaw argues that this decision, made without full briefing or argument, undermines established precedent and grants the president considerable new authority, potentially disrupting the balance of power within the executive branch. The court's intervention is seen as enabling the consolidation of power in the presidency and assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law, which could embolden the administration to act outside traditional constitutional constraints. Shaw concludes that the Supreme Court is undermining lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law.</p>

The sheriff’s department has launched criminal and internal administrative investigations into Devoe, who worked as a bailiff at the Antelope Valley Courthouse. Devoe's lawyer stated that he has endured significant personal and professional losses due to the pending matters, with the 2023 child abuse case expected to be resolved with a misdemeanor plea.</p>

          <p>Alexander Rossi's promising run at the Indianapolis 500 ended abruptly on Lap 73 when his vehicle began leaking fluid and subsequently caught fire during a pit stop. Rossi, who had been competing near the front of the pack, had to quickly exit his No. 20 car as flames engulfed it, while his fueler Mike Miller also required attention for burns. Rossi expressed his disappointment, noting the phenomenal racecar and the team's strategic decisions, but acknowledged that success in the Indy 500 requires many factors to align perfectly. He suspected the gearbox's rising temperature contributed to the incident, marking another missed opportunity for the 2016 race winner.</p>

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin indicated that there is significant resistance among Senate Republicans to President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," suggesting it could be stalled unless major changes are made. Johnson criticized the bill for increasing the deficit and urged deeper spending cuts to return to pre-pandemic spending levels. The bill, passed by the House using a reconciliation process requiring only a simple majority, faces challenges in the Senate due to concerns over the debt ceiling and spending cuts, with some senators advocating for separate consideration of the debt ceiling increase. Speaker Johnson defended the bill as a significant investment that will stimulate the U.S. economy through tax and regulation reductions.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's election victory, the Democratic Party is struggling to find a path forward, facing historically low approval ratings and a sense of cultural rejection. Communities traditionally aligned with the Democrats, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos, have shifted towards the right, exacerbating the party's challenges. The article explores the Democrats' predicament, examining the reasons behind their decline and potential strategies for recovery, noting that Republicans have been gaining ground in voter registration and working-class voters have been steadily drifting toward the GOP. The party is also grappling with internal divisions and ideological debates over policy, as they seek to rebuild their image and reconnect with voters.</p>

Kagame's actions, driven by economic interests and a desire to maintain regional power, have strained relations with Western allies, including Britain and the United States. The article suggests that Kagame's gamble may have been influenced by the US election, with a miscalculation of international response. With increased pressure from the Trump administration and potential economic consequences, Kagame may be forced to withdraw M23 and sign a peace deal, but the region's instability and Kagame's history suggest the conflict could easily reignite.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. This contradicts its role in promoting the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which aims to foster cooperation on net-zero emissions in Asia. While Japan deems LNG a "transitional fuel," studies suggest it involves significantly more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered. Critics argue that Japan's approach constitutes greenwashing, as loopholes in its G7 pledge allow for continued investment in LNG projects under the guise of energy security and diplomacy.</p>

This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, encouraging parents to respond to children's emotions without shame or dismissal. Emotionally safe parents view challenging behavior as a signal for support, not defiance, and prioritize reconnection after conflicts. The article suggests that practicing this style involves doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair.</p>

The Israeli military stated that it had struck a number of suspects in a structure near Israeli forces in Khan Younis but was still checking if "uninvolved civilians were harmed."

          <p>The story of Julie Moore, an Army spouse who, in 1965, after her husband served in the Vietnam War, helped change military protocol by ensuring families received death notifications in person rather than by telegram. Moore worked with the local Western Union office to be notified of telegrams, and then rushed to comfort the widows. The Army made a fundamental change, taking responsibility for delivering these telegrams to the wives and personally caring for the spouse during that time of cathartic change. This year, the Army post was re-named Ft. Benning, and it became Ft. Moore to honor them both.</p>

          <p>Germany's finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, has joined European leaders in calling for negotiations with the U.S. after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe, starting next week. Klingbeil warned that the tariffs would harm both the U.S. and European economies, reiterating Germany's support for the EU in handling the talks. The EU's trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, stated the bloc is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides, emphasizing that trade relations must be guided by mutual respect rather than threats.</p>
