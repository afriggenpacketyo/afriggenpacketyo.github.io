        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Health Service in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children starting next January. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, to prevent the varicella virus. This public health initiative aims to protect children from rare but severe complications and reduce the economic impact on working parents, which is estimated at £24 million annually in lost income. The move comes amid concerns over declining uptake for other childhood vaccinations.</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has excluded Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold from the latest national squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. Despite being named in the previous squad, the 26-year-old right-back was not selected for the upcoming matches. The decision follows his recent omission from Real Madrid's starting lineup in their win over Real Oviedo. In his place, the squad includes first-time call-ups for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Tottenham full-back Djed Spence, while Everton's Jack Grealish was notably left out despite a strong performance.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed it will not invite an official Israeli government delegation to the upcoming Defense Security and Equipment International (DSEI) conference in London. This decision was made in response to what the UK termed Israel's "wrong" decision to escalate its military operations in Gaza. While government officials are barred, representatives from the Israeli defense industry will still be permitted to attend the major weapons trade show. The Israeli Ministry of Defense criticized the move, stating it legitimizes terrorism and introduces inappropriate political considerations into a professional exhibition.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's legal team has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning his initial investment in Twitter, now known as X. The SEC alleges Musk illegally saved approximately $150 million by delaying the disclosure of his stake in the company beyond the required 10-day window, allowing him to buy shares at artificially low prices. Musk's lawyers argue the lawsuit is a waste of resources, claiming there was no investor harm, no ongoing violation, and that the late filing was corrected immediately. They also accuse the SEC of selectively targeting Musk for his criticism of the government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba announced better-than-expected net income for its June quarter, largely due to a 78% increase in profit from equity investments and the sale of its Turkish e-commerce division, Trendyol. The company's cloud computing unit was a significant bright spot, with revenue growing 26% year-over-year, fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence services. Despite overall revenues falling slightly short of analyst forecasts, the core e-commerce business showed resilience, though profits in that division were impacted by heavy investment in the competitive 'instant commerce' market in China.

          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth, expanding at an annual rate of 7.8% in the quarter ending in June, significantly exceeding economists' forecasts of 6.7%. This strong performance was primarily driven by the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. The reported Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figure represents an acceleration from the 7.4% growth recorded in the previous quarter. For context, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have projected that India's economy will grow by 6.3% and 6.4%, respectively, for the current fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is a net negative for the brand's appeal among potential buyers. The report found that 35% of consumers were less likely to purchase a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% said it would make them more likely to buy one. This consumer skepticism comes as Tesla faces a sales slump, increased competition, and reputational damage linked to Elon Musk's public statements. The findings suggest a significant market education problem for Tesla, as the company's future valuation heavily relies on the successful adoption of its autonomous driving services.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. tariff exemption, known as "de minimis," which allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free, ended on Friday.

The change primarily affects direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands like Shein and Temu, as well as smaller overseas businesses, which must now incorporate tariffs into their pricing.

Restaurant owners report a sharp decline in business, not only from a lack of staff but also from fewer delivery drivers on the streets and fewer customers venturing out.

          <p>A new report from the Bank of America Institute reveals that wealthier households return a higher percentage of their retail purchases compared to other income groups. In 2025, high-income shoppers returned 5.3% of their purchases, while lower-income households returned only 3.7%. The analysis suggests that affluent consumers are more likely to engage in "bracketing," where they buy multiple variations of an item with the intent to return most of them. This trend contributes to the high cost of returns for retailers, which has led many companies to tighten their return policies by shortening return windows or charging fees.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Federalization of D.C. Police Could Set Precedent for Future Power Grabs</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department is raising concerns about the potential for a centralized, politically loyal national police force. Analysts point to this move, along with an FBI mission shift toward violent crime and a new executive order to create deployable public safety units, as steps toward eroding the tradition of local and state policing. While the immediate effects in D.C. may seem minor, critics worry these actions are building a framework for a more authoritarian response to future crises. The concern is that such a force, staffed with loyalists, could be used to suppress dissent or interfere in elections.</p>

          <p>Russia's Foreign Ministry has criticized Western proposals for Ukrainian security guarantees, calling them "one-sided" and designed to contain Russia. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that such plans would transform Kyiv into a "strategic provocateur" on Russia's borders, thereby increasing the risk of a direct armed conflict between Moscow and the NATO alliance. The comments come as Ukraine's European allies work on a framework of guarantees intended to protect Kyiv from future Russian aggression as part of a potential peace settlement. Moscow insists that any security arrangement must take Russia's own security interests into account and has rejected any presence of NATO troops in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Relatives of two of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022 are asking a judge to block the public release of graphic crime scene photos and videos. They argue that the images are profoundly traumatizing and that their release violates the family's privacy. The request comes after the city of Moscow released some records, with bodies blurred, following the sentencing of killer Bryan Kohberger. An attorney for the families contended that the blurring was ineffective and failed to hide blood and other disturbing details, leading to further victimization in an era of 'true crime' commodification.</p>

These items, which include chemical materials, electronic components, medical supplies, and solar manufacturing equipment, will continue to be exempt from the Section 301 tariffs of 7.5% to 25% that were imposed during the Trump administration. The USTR stated the decision was made after considering public comments and advice from interagency committees. This extension provides temporary relief for U.S. businesses that rely on these specific imports from China for their supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Stone's latest film, "Bugonia," has become a major topic of discussion at the Venice Film Festival. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the movie features Stone as a powerful CEO who is kidnapped by two men who believe she is an alien and responsible for a declining bee population. The film is being praised as a unique and gripping drama that explores the impact of conspiracy theories and societal fringes without being preachy. Critics have lauded Stone's performance in the dark comedy, which marks her fourth collaboration with Lanthimos and is seen as more accessible than some of his previous, more divisive work.</p>

O'Neill, who lacks a medical or scientific background, is a former investment executive and an ally of Kennedy in his efforts to change U.S. vaccine policy.

          <p>The rising cost of college is a result of a fundamental shift in U.S. policy that began in the 1980s, when higher education started being treated as an individual benefit rather than a public good. Historically, from the American Revolution through the Cold War, the U.S. government consistently subsidized higher education to strengthen democracy and respond to national crises. However, significant funding cuts since the 1980s have forced universities to raise tuition, shifting the financial burden onto students and families. The article argues that restoring affordability requires reinvesting public funds, not cutting subsidies, to uphold the nation's long-standing commitment to accessible education.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that for Democrats to effectively counter the Trump administration, they must shift their focus from abstract warnings about democracy to concrete economic issues that resonate with everyday voters. The author points to the 2024 election, where inflation and the cost of eggs were more potent issues than constitutional norms. With grocery prices rising again under President Trump, the article suggests Democrats have a clear opening to connect his policies, such as tariffs and immigration crackdowns, to the financial strain on American families. The central argument is that saving democracy requires proving it is a more affordable alternative for voters.</p>

The incident, which occurred during a restructuring of the bank's retail business, was described by an executive as an error where emails were sent ahead of schedule. The Financial Sector Union condemned the action, stating the "botched" and "disgusting" episode caused panic and distress among staff. The bank's CEO reportedly called the move "indefensible" and has launched an investigation, while the affected staff have since been spoken to personally.</p>

Salazar was killed by a sheriff's deputy while covering the Chicano Moratorium protest in 1970, and his columns on immigration, political division, and the push for Latino rights mirror many of the issues facing society today. The article argues that Salazar's legacy as a truth-teller who was unafraid to criticize all sides is more important than ever as journalists face increasing hostility and physical threats.

          <p>A summer of intensified federal immigration raids in Oxnard, California, has created deep distrust and tension within the city's large Latino community. These sweeps, targeting farms and packinghouses, have led to street protests and criticism that local officials are not doing enough to protect residents. The situation escalated after a farmworker, Jaime Alanis García, died from a fall while trying to evade federal agents during a raid on a cannabis facility. The federal actions are undermining decades of work by the Oxnard Police Department to build trust with the immigrant population, placing city leaders in a defensive position as they try to navigate community anger.</p>

          <p>Despite having nearly 4,500 rental vouchers available—enough to end veteran homelessness in Los Angeles County—thousands of veterans remain on the streets due to systemic failures. Housing authorities are only utilizing about 59% of the available vouchers, well below the national average, with about 4,000 vouchers currently unused. Officials blame a complex and slow referral process managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, but records show that nearly half of referred veterans drop out before securing a lease. The bureaucratic hurdles, coupled with a high rate of lease terminations, mean that for every three veterans housed, two others lose their housing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to repeal the 2001 Roadless Rule, which protects nearly 60 million acres of national forests from development, in order to build more roads. The U.S. Forest Service argues that increased road access is necessary for wildfire suppression and active forest management. However, many forest ecologists and fire scientists warn that more roads could actually increase wildfire risk, as roads are a primary source of human-caused ignitions and can introduce invasive, flammable plants. Environmental groups suggest the move is primarily motivated by a desire to increase timber production rather than to mitigate fire danger.</p>
