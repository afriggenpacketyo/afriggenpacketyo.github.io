          <h2>Market Analyst Outlines Ten Factors Supporting Stocks Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:14:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, this article argues against conventional wisdom suggesting market turmoil. It posits that highly valued tech stocks are insulated from trade disputes and lists ten positive drivers for the market, including strong corporate earnings and a proposed tax bill that would inject billions into the U.S. economy. The analysis also points to major infrastructure needs, increased bank lending capacity, and a pro-business M&A environment as reasons for optimism, suggesting these factors outweigh tariff-related risks.

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that individuals retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly increased. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is relaunching the Pensions Commission, which previously led to the auto-enrolment system. The new analysis highlights stark disparities, with nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners, the self-employed, women, and certain ethnic minorities, not contributing to a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old Canadian girl, initially reported as kidnapped from a rest stop in upstate New York, was found deceased. The New York State Police, who had issued an Amber Alert based on the father's claim, now state there is no indication an abduction occurred. Investigators have identified inconsistencies in the father's story and timeline of events. The investigation is now focused on the father, though no immediate arrest has been announced, and authorities have assured the public there is no ongoing threat.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ predicts that the technology will cross a critical threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale educational quantum computers and more powerful industrial-grade systems, which it sells globally. The founder and CEO, Xiang Jingen, tempers this optimism by comparing the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s. He emphasizes that significant development is still required before the technology achieves broad, mainstream applicability.</p>

          <p>Comedian Ellen DeGeneres has stated that Donald Trump's 2024 presidential election victory was the catalyst for her permanent move to the United Kingdom with her wife, Portia de Rossi. After initially planning a part-time stay, DeGeneres decided to remain in their new English farmhouse after the election results were announced. She has since expressed her love for the "simpler way of life" in the UK. The article also notes her support for fellow comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who also left the U.S. following Trump's election.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. This shift has contributed to a decline in the president's approval rating, especially among Hispanic Americans. The poll also highlights a strong public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices and inflation, an area where Mr. Trump's disapproval has reached a new high. The newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill" is initially viewed by most as primarily benefiting the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. It suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings. The expert provides practical tips, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to help parents nurture this non-negotiable skill.</p>

          <p>This article explores the investment potential of Nebius Group, an AI data center infrastructure provider backed by Nvidia. As a "neocloud" company, Nebius offers access to Nvidia's GPUs through its own data centers, competing with firms like CoreWeave and Oracle. Despite its stock price already appreciating significantly, the analysis suggests it may be undervalued compared to its peers, citing strong revenue growth and bullish price targets from Wall Street analysts. With massive capital expenditure flowing into AI infrastructure from tech giants, the article posits that Nebius is well-positioned for continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview, Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, discusses the precarious position of American businesses operating in China. He notes that while an extension of the current 90-day tariff pause is almost inevitable, the broader trade relationship remains fraught with uncertainty. Stein explains that while China has taken steps on issues like restricting fentanyl precursors, the U.S. has yet to reciprocate by lowering related tariffs. The business community remains concerned that discussions between the two nations are almost exclusively focused on tariffs, neglecting other critical aspects of the complex economic relationship.</p>

          <p>A non-profit named Better Angels, founded by tech billionaire Adam Miller, is attempting to disrupt the affordable housing sector by building projects without public subsidies. The organization is bidding on several large-scale developments in Los Angeles, proposing to finance them with a mix of its own equity and conventional loans. This model aims to prove that affordable housing can be built faster, cheaper, and still generate a market-rate return for investors. By simplifying the financing, Better Angels hopes to attract private capital and demonstrate a scalable, capitalist solution to the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in a tragic incident at a medical facility on Long Island, New York, after being pulled into a running MRI machine. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, causing a "medical episode" that ultimately proved fatal. This event serves as a stark reminder of the strict safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn any magnetic metal object into a dangerous projectile.</p>

The author notes that despite a recent positive visit to China, the Australian government's stance on issues like the potential sale of the Port of Darwin sends mixed signals. The article suggests that such actions undermine attempts to convince Chinese investors that Australia is a reliable partner.

Bass criticized the use of federal troops in the city as a misuse of taxpayer money.
