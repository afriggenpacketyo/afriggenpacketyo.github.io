          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado fire attack on pro-Israel demonstrators, has been charged with a federal hate crime. According to the criminal complaint, Soliman allegedly attacked the demonstrators with a makeshift flamethrower because they were supporting Israel and calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The affidavit states that Soliman threw Molotov cocktails while yelling "Free Palestine," and authorities found multiple unlit Molotov cocktails at the scene. The U.S. Attorney General condemned the attack as vile anti-Semitic violence. The suspect also allegedly told investigators that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. </p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis indicates that colleges are slightly less diverse following the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action in admissions. Data from 116 colleges shows a decrease in underrepresented minority students at schools that previously considered race in admissions. Some experts suggest the ruling may have influenced campus diversity, while others point to potential issues with FAFSA applications as a contributing factor. Experts emphasize that diversity is essential to students' education and that socioeconomic status could be considered to increase diversity on campus. </p>

          <p>Home Office Minister Jess Phillips has apologized to MPs for a delay in the publication of a report on grooming gangs. The government had commissioned Baroness Louise Casey to conduct a rapid audit into the data and evidence on group-based child sexual assault, with the report originally due in May. Phillips cited a request for a short extension from Baroness Casey as the reason for the delay. The minister assured MPs that the government will respond to the report and outline its plans once the evidence is in hand.</p>

The salon owners claim that the switch in labor law, which stemmed from Assembly Bill 5 in 2019, unfairly targets their businesses and creates an uneven playing field. The nail salon industry in California has been dominated by Vietnamese workers since the influx of refugees in 1975.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are heading to the polls to elect a new president, in an election seen as a referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeol and the governing conservative party. The election comes after Yoon's impeachment for declaring martial law, which has aggravated political polarization. The new president will face challenges including tariff threats from the Trump administration and North Korea's growing closeness with Russia. Both candidates have pledged to unite the nation, but represent the country's deepening division.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack targeted several Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers, marking an unprecedented strike in its scope and sophistication. Ukraine claimed over 40 bombers were damaged or destroyed, while Moscow acknowledged only several planes were struck. The attack demonstrated Ukraineâ€™s capability to hit high-value targets anywhere in Russia, inflicting significant losses to Moscow's war machine. Repeated Ukrainian strikes prompted Moscow to relocate bombers farther from the conflict.</p>

          <h2>The Myth That Taking Longer Makes for Better Decisions</h2>

          <p>A decision coach shares that the number one myth they see with clients is the belief that taking a long time to make a decision leads to better outcomes. Many clients spend months or even years mulling over decisions, which adds too many details and makes the decision harder. Spending too much time agonizing over a decision can be draining and negatively impact one's life. The coach recommends avoiding the trap of overanalyzing and instead taking simple steps to make decisions more efficiently.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI is reportedly seeking a valuation of $113 billion in a $300 million share sale, according to the Financial Times. The deal would allow employees to sell shares to investors, with a larger investment round expected to follow. XAI acquired X, Musk's social media business, in March, valuing xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Musk recently stepped back from the Trump administration to refocus on Tesla.
