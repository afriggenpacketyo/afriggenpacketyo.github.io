Chime reported a net income of $12.9 million on $518.7 million in revenue for the March quarter, with 8.6 million active members, and offers services such as high-yield savings accounts and fee-free overdraft protection.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will remove all sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country a chance at greatness. Speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Trump stated that Syria has a new government that will hopefully stabilize the country and maintain peace. Syria, previously designated a state sponsor of terrorism, has been under U.S. sanctions since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011. The move follows the toppling of the Assad regime in 2024 and aims to restore normal relations between the U.S. and Syria.</p>

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry company, is preparing to raise prices and reroute shipments in response to President Trump's potential 36 percent tariffs on goods entering the United States from Thailand, where the company manufactures its products. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that the company is 'battle ready' but acknowledged the uncertainty paralyzing businesses and is considering whether to pass on costs to consumers or adjust pricing globally. Pandora is also streamlining its supply chain by changing distribution routes for products sold in Canada and Latin America to bypass its Baltimore hub, but has no plans to move production to the United States due to higher labor costs.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that Pete Rose and 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, have been reinstated, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by gambling scandals. Manfred is changing the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, stating that bans will expire at death, and Rose's reinstatement comes eight months after his death. Rose agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 following an investigation that concluded he repeatedly bet on the Reds as a player and manager, while Jackson was part of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider their eligibility under its rules.</p>

The analysis indicates that households earning an average of $38,000 per year would need $67,000 to afford the items tracked by the LISEP index.
