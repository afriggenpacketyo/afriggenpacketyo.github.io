          <h2>Trump to Visit Federal Reserve Amid Public Pressure on Chairman Powell</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 05:50:34 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump's planned visit to the Federal Reserve headquarters follows his public criticism of Chairman Jerome Powell over interest rates and building renovation costs, which he suggested could be grounds for dismissal. This visit intensifies pressure on the Fed's independence, a cornerstone of economic stability supported by economists and investors. The president's actions and rhetoric, including calling Powell a "numbskull," have rattled financial markets, despite his recent statement that firing the chair is "highly unlikely." The meeting underscores the ongoing tension between the White House and the central bank over monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has launched a probe after data revealed that government-issued payment cards for asylum seekers were used for gambling. These "Aspen cards," intended for essentials like food, were used thousands of times in casinos and betting shops. While online attempts were blocked, physical transactions were successful, prompting criticism from the Conservative opposition. The government provides about 80,000 asylum seekers with these cards and has pledged to take urgent action to prevent such misuse in the future.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing criticism for its policy of deporting convicted criminals to Afghanistan, a country run by the Taliban regime, which Germany does not officially recognize. The government defends the move as part of a "repatriation offensive," arguing that serious criminals have no right to reside in the country. However, human rights advocates and researchers warn that deportees could face torture or inhumane treatment. The policy also complicates Germany's diplomatic stance, relying on Qatar as a mediator to facilitate the controversial flights.</p>

A potential 15% tariff rate is being discussed, which analysts see as a better outcome than the previously threatened 50%, but no deal is guaranteed. In response to the uncertainty, the EU is preparing countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs on US goods totaling over €93 billion.

          <p>Ahead of a meeting with the Deputy Attorney General, a 2022 sentencing memorandum from the Department of Justice is being revisited, detailing Ghislaine Maxwell's "significant pattern of dishonest conduct." The document outlines how she enabled and directly participated in the sexual abuse of multiple teenage girls alongside Jeffrey Epstein, preying on vulnerable individuals and showing no remorse. Prosecutors described her as a vital participant in Epstein's sex trafficking operation who used her respectable image to gain victims' trust. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence but continues to appeal her conviction.</p>

          <p>The UK's automotive industry has recorded its worst first-half production figures since 1953, excluding the COVID-19 shutdown period. Data from the SMMT shows car output fell 7.3% and van production plummeted by 45%, partly due to a plant closure and uncertainty over US tariffs. While a new US-UK tariff deal and government grants for electric vehicles may offer some relief, the industry body expressed concern. It remains unclear which vehicles will qualify for the new EV grants, creating confusion for manufacturers and consumers ahead of a key sales month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing its sharpest sales decline in a decade, Tesla has announced plans to build a more affordable car and secure regulatory approval for its self-driving software in Europe this year. The company's profits have shrunk amid increased competition from Chinese automakers, US tariff costs, and damage to its brand from CEO Elon Musk's political activities. The end of a key US tax credit for EV buyers is also expected to hurt sales. Musk emphasized that achieving full autonomy for its vehicles is the key to unlocking the company's future value.

          <p>Nigerian artist John Madu is being featured in an exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where his work creates a dialogue between the Dutch master and contemporary Lagos. Madu, who was influenced by Van Gogh from a young age, has created ten large paintings that infuse the famous artist's motifs with a modern, cosmopolitan West African sensibility. Like Van Gogh, Madu is a self-taught artist who developed a unique style. The exhibition, "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path," highlights a cross-cultural artistic connection and celebrates a global perspective on art.</p>

          <p>China is grappling with a surprising oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy sector, as the nation's capacity to incinerate trash has outpaced the actual amount of waste being generated. An optimistic and rapid expansion of incineration plants, combined with a slowdown in waste growth due to economic and urbanization factors, has left an estimated 40% of capacity idle. While China has the world's highest processing capacity, this mismatch between supply and demand reveals an unexpected inefficiency in a sector once seen as a key part of the country's environmental strategy.</p>

Green is believed to be only the second person in history to accomplish this grueling task.
