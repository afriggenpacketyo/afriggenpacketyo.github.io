          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to its lowest point since 1939. This trend is accompanied by a growing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The article highlights that this decline is particularly pronounced and beneficial among underage individuals, where drinking rates have plummeted over the last few decades. While acknowledging a potential link to a broader decline in social activities, the overall shift is presented as a significant public health victory.</p>

          <p>Actress Margaret Qualley shared an amusing anecdote about trying to play matchmaker for her mother, Andie MacDowell, with actor Bill Murray. During an appearance on "The Tonight Show," Qualley described a backstage encounter where she learned Murray and her mother both live in Charleston. Her plan was complicated when Murray revealed that he and MacDowell didn't get along well during the filming of their 1993 movie "Groundhog Day." Despite this, Qualley expressed hope that their shared history and single status could spark a romance, humorously urging Murray to connect with her.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of recent visitors to Grand Teton National Park are being contacted by health officials due to potential rabies exposure from bat-infested cabins. The alert spans 38 states and seven countries for guests who stayed at the Jackson Lake Lodge between May and July. Although bats tested so far have been negative for rabies, officials are acting with caution because a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed, especially during sleep. Authorities are recommending preventative shots for certain individuals, while emphasizing there is no ongoing safety concern for the general lodge area.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasts predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend. The storm's current path is projected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, bringing heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. While tropical storm watches are in effect for several islands, forecast models show the hurricane curving northward into the open ocean. This trajectory is expected to keep it well offshore from the U.S. East Coast, though meteorologists continue to monitor its progress closely.</p>

          <p>Activist firm Engine Capital has acquired a significant stake in life sciences company Avantor and is publicly calling for substantial changes to address its severe underperformance. In a letter to the board, Engine criticized the company's flawed leadership, poor capital allocation on overpriced acquisitions, and a failure to accept a previous acquisition offer at a much higher share price. The activist investor is demanding a focus on operational efficiency, cost reduction, a board refresh, and prioritizing share repurchases over costly M&A. Engine suggests that these changes could significantly increase shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to pursue his own case, calling the legal action an attempt to intimidate him for his reporting.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This shift is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones and a wider range of price points compared to the iPhone. Analysts note that while Apple still leads, its static design has created an opening for Samsung's new form factors. In response, Apple is expected to launch a slimmer iPhone and is rumored to be developing its own foldable device for release in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

The primary points of contention in the eight-month-long negotiations are wages and compensation for unpaid work performed when planes are on the ground.

          <p>American farmers in the Midwest are grappling with a severe economic squeeze caused by the dual challenges of climate change and President Trump's trade policies. Extreme weather patterns, from drought one year to excessive rain the next, have drastically reduced crop yields and increased operating costs. Concurrently, retaliatory tariffs have caused exports of key crops like soybeans to China to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing domestic prices. Despite the financial hardship these policies create, many farmers remain supportive of the administration, highlighting the complex political landscape in rural America.</p>

Instead of zero-tolerance policing, the city uses a "carrot and stick" approach, offering targeted social services, job training, and housing, while also ensuring stricter prosecution for those who continue violent activity.

However, certified financial planners strongly recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. While a three-decade saving period is viable, an earlier start in one's early 20s can result in a significantly larger nest egg with smaller monthly contributions.

Montoya, who had lived in the U.S. for three years, was remembered as a hardworking man supporting his family.

          <p>A great horned owl is facing a lengthy and uncertain rehabilitation after being found stuck in a glue trap in Orange County. A well-meaning individual cut the bird's feathers to free it, inadvertently causing severe damage that will require the owl to undergo a full molt to regrow them, a process that can take over a year. Wildlife officials warn that glue traps are inhumane and indiscriminately harm non-target animals, including birds of prey. The incident serves as a public reminder of the dangers of these devices and the proper way to handle wildlife emergencies.</p>

          <p>Amid a surge in homelessness among Americans aged 55 and older, healthcare organizations are stepping in to provide housing solutions. Groups like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), funded by Medicare and Medicaid, traditionally aim to keep frail seniors in their homes but now face the reality that many clients have no home to begin with. This "national scandal" is driven by rising housing costs and economic instability, forcing healthcare providers to partner with developers or purchase their own properties. The trend highlights the inextricable link between stable housing and health outcomes for the elderly.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. In a social media post, Trump stated that after a call with Zelenskyy and European leaders, it was determined that a direct "Peace Agreement" is preferable to a temporary ceasefire. Trump framed the upcoming meeting as a discussion of this proposal, which could potentially save millions of lives. The announcement marks a shift in focus toward a permanent resolution after the Alaska meeting concluded without a concrete deal to end the conflict.</p>

The olive tree was one of several memorials to Halimi, whose brutal killing by a gang that targeted him for being Jewish caused widespread shock in France.

          <p>California has approved a comprehensive and forward-thinking plan to protect the western Joshua tree, a species that is currently abundant but faces significant habitat loss due to climate change. The plan identifies resilient habitats, aims to mitigate wildfire risk, and introduces genetic diversity to help the trees adapt to warmer temperatures. However, the plan is controversial among some high desert communities, who argue that new permitting requirements and fees for removing trees will stifle development and increase living costs. The effort is considered groundbreaking for its proactive approach to conserving a species based on future climate projections.</p>

          <p>This opinion column posits that the Trump administration's sudden federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force is a calculated distraction. The author argues the move is not a response to a genuine crime emergency, as crime rates are at a 30-year low, but rather an attempt to shift public attention away from the Jeffrey Epstein files, in which the president's name reportedly appears. The piece draws parallels to historical instances where governments used emergency powers under false pretenses. It concludes that the action is a politically motivated abuse of power designed to protect one individual rather than serve the public interest.</p>

While the administration claims it is enforcing laws that local Democratic leaders neglect, political scientists see it as a test of presidential authority.

The bear, tracked by wildlife officials as Yellow 2291, crossed multiple major highways and navigated urban areas during her remarkable trek.

          <p>Young people in Washington D.C. say that President Trump's decision to deploy federal forces and take control of the local police has made them feel more afraid, not safer. Teenagers interviewed by NPR expressed fear of being wrongly targeted by federal officers, who they feel are more intimidating than protective. This sentiment comes as D.C. officials legally challenge the federal takeover, which was justified by the administration with rhetoric about "roving mobs of wild youth," despite data showing a decrease in crime. Youth advocates argue the crackdown unfairly punishes all young people for the actions of a few.</p>

          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda suggests that young chimps acquire their patterns of combining vocal sounds and physical gestures from their mothers, not their fathers. Scientists observed that individuals related through their maternal line exhibited similar communication styles, a pattern not seen among paternally related chimps. Because young chimpanzees spend their formative years almost exclusively with their mothers, this indicates the behavior is learned rather than purely genetic. This finding suggests that the capacity for socially learned communication may be an ancient trait dating back at least six million years to the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.</p>
