          <p>A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reveals increasing pessimism among American companies operating in China. Only 41% of surveyed firms expressed optimism about their five-year business outlook, a significant drop from nearly double that rate in 2021. The uncertain US-China relationship, fierce competition, and the economic slowdown are cited as the leading drivers of this declining confidence. Many multinational companies are finding it harder to replicate their past successes in China, as local companies become more innovative and competitive, contributing to a broader pullback by global investors in the region. This article reflects a challenging environment for American businesses in China. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company known for producing Wegovy, plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 9,000 positions, around 11.5% of its total employees. The company aims to simplify its organization, speed up decision-making, and reallocate resources towards growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity care. This transformation will incur a one-off cost of 8 billion Danish kroner ($1.26 billion), which will impact the company's full-year operating profit growth expectations. This strategic move by Novo Nordisk is designed to improve efficiency and focus on key growth areas. </p>

          <p>Europe's planned ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars and vans from 2035 is facing renewed scrutiny. Over 150 leaders from the electric car industry signed an open letter urging the European Commission to maintain its commitment to the zero-emission target. However, automotive industry associations argue that the 2035 carbon targets are no longer feasible and need recalibration to protect Europe's industrial competitiveness. This split in opinion highlights the challenges and complexities of transitioning to electric vehicles in Europe, with potential impacts on investment and global competitiveness. </p>

          <p>Despite only securing two Premier League wins since April, statistical analysis suggests that Manchester United has been performing better than their results indicate. While the team has earned few points, their underlying numbers show they have been creating and restricting chances effectively. The primary issue lies in scoring and saving goals, with players underperforming historical averages in both areas. Although tactical adjustments by manager Ruben Amorim may contribute, the team's efficiency in converting chances remains a key area for improvement. </p>
