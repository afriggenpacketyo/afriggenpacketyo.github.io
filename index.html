          <p>Former congressman George Santos has been sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft. Santos misused campaign funds for personal expenses, illegally claimed unemployment benefits, and lied to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). He was found to have charged over $44,000 to his campaign using credit cards belonging to unaware contributors. Santos has been ordered to pay at least $374,000 in restitution and was expelled from Congress following investigations revealing he fabricated his background and misused funds.</p>

Authorities have charged a 19-year-old with causing the wildfire by failing to extinguish a bonfire.

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has experienced its largest drop since 1990, falling by 32% since January, primarily due to concerns over President Trump's trade policies. The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research reports that consumers perceive risks to the economy due to trade policy uncertainty and potential inflation. Consumer expectations of inflation have also surged, reaching the highest level since 1981. This decline in sentiment suggests that consumers are increasingly hesitant to spend, potentially leading to an economic slowdown.</p>

Trump's alignment with Putin, demands for Ukraine to cede territory, and disregard for international law demonstrate a pattern of authoritarianism and disregard for global stability. His actions, including tariff policies and defiance of U.S. courts, reflect a broader assault on the rule of law and a pursuit of personal gain over national interests.</p>

          <p>Laurence Fox has denied sharing an upskirting image of TV star Narinder Kaur, pleading not guilty to two counts under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The charges stem from an alleged incident in April 2024, where Fox is accused of sharing an intimate image of Kaur on X without her consent. Fox has been released on bail with conditions preventing him from contacting Kaur. The trial is set to proceed at Woolwich Crown Court.</p>
