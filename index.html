          <p>Kering, the luxury group behind Gucci, saw its shares jump over 9% after reporting a significant improvement in its third-quarter financial performance, narrowing its sales decline and surpassing earnings estimates. The company's overall sales dropped by 5% on a comparable basis, a notable recovery from the previous quarter's 15% fall. Gucci, its largest brand, experienced a 14% sales decrease but demonstrated a sharp sequential improvement from an earlier 25% plunge. CEO Luca de Meo acknowledged that while performance is improving, it still lags the broader market, reinforcing his commitment to a comprehensive turnaround strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stern warning, threatening to sue the Trump administration if President Trump deploys National Guard troops to San Francisco. Trump had indicated such a deployment might occur, citing concerns over crime and the city's perceived decline, following similar deployments in other U.S. cities. Newsom fiercely criticized this potential federal intervention as an "abuse of power" and a direct "assault on the rule of law," asserting California's commitment to defending its state sovereignty against authoritarian overreach. San Francisco's mayor also expressed opposition to the National Guard's deployment, while welcoming other forms of federal assistance for drug enforcement.</p>

          <p>Thames Water, the United Kingdom's largest water company, has received its lowest possible environmental rating, a one-star score, from the Environment Agency for its consistently poor performance in 2024, particularly regarding sewage spills. This damning assessment is part of a broader report revealing that serious pollution incidents across England surged by 60% compared to the previous year, with most water and sewerage companies rated as "requiring improvement" or worse. Mired in significant financial difficulties, including a £16.8 billion debt, the company admitted that its transformation program would require at least a decade to achieve the necessary scale of change, fueling public anger and calls for an overhaul of the privatized water sector.</p>

          <p>The third T20 cricket match between England and New Zealand in Auckland was abandoned due to heavy rain, resulting in a 1-0 series victory for England. Only 3.4 overs were played, with New Zealand reaching 38-1 before the weather halted play. This marks Harry Brook's first overseas series win as England's white-ball captain, with the team winning seven of eight completed T20s under his leadership. The persistent rain denied England further preparation time for the upcoming T20 World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly engaging in discussions with several leading quantum computing firms, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, regarding potential federal funding in exchange for equity stakes. This strategic move aligns with Washington's broader national security efforts to bolster domestic capabilities in critical industries, following earlier investments in rare earths and semiconductor manufacturing. The government aims to secure a share in the success of companies that benefit from public funds, signaling an ideological shift towards increased state intervention in strategically vital technological sectors. This proactive approach is largely motivated by the intensifying technological and economic competition with China.</p>

The camp was set up by Vučić's supporters in response to student-led protests. Vučić stated the perpetrator was politically motivated and intended to cause public danger, emphasizing that such an incident was anticipated given prior calls for violence.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Holding, saw its shares surge by approximately 40% after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter operating income of 6.4 billion Swedish kronor ($680.4 million). This strong performance, up from 5.8 billion kronor a year prior, was largely attributed to an ongoing 18 billion kronor cost-saving program and one-off items. CEO Håkan Samuelsson highlighted a return to slight sales growth in September and the ramp-up of BEV car sales. Despite a challenging short-term outlook due to macroeconomic factors, the company expects further positive effects from cost-cutting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed new, significant sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in a concerted effort to pressure Moscow into ending its ongoing war in Ukraine. These measures represent the first direct interventions by the Trump administration against Russia's energy industry, targeting entities deemed crucial for funding the Kremlin's military machine, as they account for nearly half of Russia's total crude oil exports. The decision, which follows similar actions by the UK and the cancellation of a planned meeting with President Putin, signals a strategic pivot by Trump from diplomatic mediation to applying robust economic pressure. The long-term efficacy of these sanctions in altering the war's trajectory and their impact on global oil markets remain subjects of ongoing analysis.</p>

Starring August Diehl, the movie delves into the nature of evil and ideological extremism, showing how Mengele, despite evading capture, could not escape his past or his warped justifications.

Consequently, many long-time, loyal fans, such as accountant Bob Hinz, are finding themselves priced out of attending games, despite acknowledging the inherent "business" aspect of professional sports.

          <p>President Trump's federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon and Illinois are currently embroiled in significant legal challenges, including an anticipated review by the Supreme Court. Initial district court rulings had blocked these deployments, which were undertaken against the explicit wishes of the respective Democratic state governors. This article emphasizes that upcoming decisions from the 9th and 7th Circuit Courts of Appeals are expected to provide crucial clarity on the extent of the president's authority to deploy federal military resources domestically. Legal experts voice concerns that these rulings, particularly any from the Supreme Court, could potentially embolden the administration and establish precedents for future interventions, possibly allowing for a "blindness to facts" in justifying such actions.</p>

          <p>A significant U.K. study, published in The Lancet, has analyzed data from over 150 clinical trials to compare the physical side effects of 30 different antidepressants. The research details how each medication can impact weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol, providing a "sports league table" of side effect profiles. Commonly prescribed SSRIs generally showed fewer physical side effects compared to older drugs. The lead author, Dr. Toby Pillinger, hopes this data will empower patients and prescribers to make more individualized medication decisions based on specific health profiles and desired side effect avoidance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is grappling with a severe and persistent shortage of affordable "starter homes," effectively locking out many first-time buyers, particularly in rapidly expanding urban centers like Austin, Texas. This article reveals that the construction of smaller, more budget-friendly houses has drastically fallen from 40% of the market in the 1980s to a mere 12% by 2023, largely due to escalating material costs and narrower profit margins for developers. Additionally, existing homeowners are reluctant to sell their properties and forfeit low mortgage rates, further tightening inventory. Local zoning restrictions and protracted approval processes also exacerbate the issue, though community initiatives and strategic compromises like expanding search areas offer some potential avenues for prospective buyers.

Russian state media largely refrained from reporting Trump's critical comments, while former President Dmitry Medvedev vehemently denounced Trump for aligning with "insane Europe" and embarking on a "warpath."

This article highlights a notable divergence between Beijing's optimistic outlook regarding the property market's bottoming out and the prevailing market reality.

Promises of a new "maritime doctrine" to actively turn back boats are being dismissed as mere "blah-blah," with French police largely refraining from intervention due to inherent safety risks for both officers and migrants. Despite substantial UK financial contributions for border security, persistent legal and moral obstacles, coupled with inadequate equipment and personnel, continue to impede more robust French action, allowing dangerously overcrowded boats to proceed with their perilous journeys.</p>

          <p>U.S. sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, are expected to create supply disruptions for China and India, Moscow's primary energy customers, though without causing an immediate global supply shock. The sanctions, designed to diminish Russia's ability to fund its war, provide companies with nearly a month to cease operations. This article notes that China and India, which collectively import millions of barrels of Russian oil daily, will likely be compelled to seek alternative suppliers, primarily from the U.S. and OPEC nations. While global oil prices initially reacted with a jump, experts anticipate that a complete halt of Russian crude flows is improbable, but a short-term interruption in supply is considered inevitable.
