            <p>President Trump addressed the tragic shooting at Florida State University, expressing his condolences but indicating his reluctance to support new gun control measures, reaffirming his commitment to the Second Amendment. He emphasized that the issue lies with individuals, not firearms, and mentioned his past actions, such as restricting "bump stocks," while also noting the Supreme Court's recent decision against that rule. Trump also stated his familiarity with Florida State University and the surrounding area, given his primary residence in Palm Beach, Florida. The shooting resulted in two fatalities and six injuries, with the alleged gunman in custody. Optimism score: 30</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to review the Trump administration's challenge to nationwide injunctions issued by district judges, consolidating three cases into one. This decision follows nationwide injunctions blocking President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. The court will consider whether district judges can issue rulings affecting the entire country, potentially impacting the President's agenda and national policy. The Trump administration argues that these injunctions have become too common, hindering its ability to enforce laws, particularly in immigration.</p>

            <p>The IRS is evaluating whether to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status following President Trump's suggestion after Harvard rejected his administration's demands for policy changes, including those related to viewpoint diversity. Experts note that stripping an institution like Harvard of its tax exemption would be historically unprecedented. The IRS's decision comes after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard, escalating the conflict over the university's policies. Legal experts suggest that such a move could face significant legal challenges, particularly concerning academic freedom and freedom of speech.</p>

            <p>Honda Motor is relocating production of its Civic Hybrid hatchback from Japan to the U.S., a decision announced amidst ongoing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. While the company did not explicitly attribute the move to tariffs, a spokesperson cited Honda's long-standing policy of producing cars where the demand exists. This shift reflects a broader trend of companies adjusting their manufacturing strategies in response to trade policies and the desire to localize production for key markets. The move also supports domestic manufacturing in the U.S.</p>

            <p>Brazil experienced a trade deficit with China for the first two months of 2025, marking the first such occurrence in nearly a decade. This deficit was primarily driven by a significant increase in Chinese imports, including solar panels and petroleum drilling platforms. However, the trade balance shifted by the end of the first quarter, with Brazil ultimately reporting a US$700 million trade surplus with China. The initial deficit was attributed to concerns among Brazilian business executives regarding the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington, leading to a surge in imports.</p>

The US Department of Justice, along with 17 US states, argued that Google illegally dominated the technology that determines online ad placement. The judge found that Google “wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts” that enabled it to “acquire and maintain monopoly power.” Google plans to appeal the decision, arguing that publishers choose Google because its tools are effective and affordable.</p>
