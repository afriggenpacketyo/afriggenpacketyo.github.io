          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are voicing increased apprehension about the sustainability of the United States' national debt. In a central bank-supervised publication, they recommended gradually reducing China's holdings of US Treasury bonds, which are currently at their lowest level since 2009. The article highlights a strategic shift, suggesting that China should diversify its reserves by increasing its holdings of gold and other strategic materials. This reflects Beijing's effort to mitigate financial risks associated with its significant exposure to US dollar assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a definitive ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. While Trump described the talks as "productive," he acknowledged that significant points of contention remain and that the final resolution is up to Ukraine and European allies. Putin called the summit a "starting point" for improving relations, which he said are at a post-Cold War low. The lack of a concrete deal has left the future of the peace process uncertain.</p>

Rooney reflects on career highs and lows, the sacrifices his parents made, and the challenges of his recent managerial roles. Now transitioning into punditry, he aims to be fair and honest in his analysis, even if it means criticizing former teammates or his old club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary article portrays the Alaska summit as a diplomatic victory for Vladimir Putin, who was welcomed back onto the world stage after years of relative isolation. The author notes Putin's dominant posture during the brief press conference and his success in getting President Trump to echo his views on the 2020 U.S. election. The piece suggests Putin effectively manipulated the summit by appealing to Trump's personal grievances, securing a significant propaganda win without making any tangible concessions. The meeting is framed as an appeasement that reinforced Putin's standing.</p>

          <p>This article provides five main observations from the summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, highlighting the lack of a concrete ceasefire deal for Ukraine. Key points include Putin's warm reception on U.S. soil, which marked a significant return to the world stage for the isolated leader. The article also notes the vagueness of the leaders' statements, with Trump not mentioning Ukraine at all in his remarks and Putin reiterating maximalist demands for peace. Ultimately, the summit generated more questions than answers, concluding with Putin's open invitation for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is proposing new regulations that would require mainland Chinese nationals applying for residency to prove they have relinquished their Chinese household registration and passport. The policy is framed as a necessary measure to address national security threats from Beijing, including infiltration and identity ambiguity. This move represents a significant tightening of cross-strait residency governance under President Lai. Critics and those affected view the changes as an "attack" on mainland spouses, underscoring the escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit from Washington D.C. officials, the Trump administration has rescinded its decision to take direct control of the city's police force. An agreement was reached after a federal judge indicated the administration likely could not legally control the police department, though the president could still direct the mayor to provide police services. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith, who had been ordered to report to a federally appointed commissioner, will remain in full command of her department. The conflict began when President Trump initiated a federal crime crackdown in the capital.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a controversial proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps, aiming to gain up to five U.S. House seats. This move is a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas and is intended to help Democrats win control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. The proposed maps are designed to create significant Democratic voter advantages in several currently Republican-held districts, sparking criticism of partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic concludes that the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska was largely fruitless, producing no tangible agreement to end the war in Ukraine. The article argues that the meeting was a significant victory for Vladimir Putin, who was granted a high-profile reception on U.S. soil, effectively ending his status as an international pariah. Despite President Trump's vague claims of productivity, the lack of specifics and Putin's unchanged demands suggest a diplomatic stalemate. The author suggests Putin achieved his goals of gaining legitimacy and time while offering nothing in return.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that former police chief Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," meticulously planned his prison escape over six months. Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out of the facility. The report highlights multiple security failures, including an unsupervised dock and a guard opening a gate without confirming identity. Hardin survived in the woods for nearly two weeks before being recaptured.</p>
