            <p>A 38-year-old man, Cody Balmer, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder, terrorism, and arson after allegedly setting fire to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence in Harrisburg. The incident occurred early Sunday morning while Shapiro and his family were inside, celebrating the first night of Passover, but they were safely evacuated without injuries. Investigators are exploring potential motives, including the fact that Shapiro is Jewish, and the arson took place on Passover. The fire caused significant damage to the residence, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the US to completely cancel its tariffs, as the trade war between the two countries continues. This week, Trump announced a 90-day pause on some global tariffs but increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%. The Chinese commerce ministry called on the US to correct its mistakes and return to mutual respect. While the US administration seemed ready to offer a concession by exempting some electronic products, this was later contradicted by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, injecting uncertainty into the situation.</p>

Greer maintained that the U.S. is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade, blaming China's retaliation for the current situation.
