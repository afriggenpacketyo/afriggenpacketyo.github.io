          <h2>Trump Floats 80% China Tariff Amid Trade Talks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested lowering tariffs on China to 80% before trade talks in Switzerland, a significant reduction from the current 145% but still potentially prohibitive. The article highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether this rate is a long-term goal or a negotiating tactic, as China remains a key challenge in Trump's efforts to reshape global trade. The U.S. exported $143.5 billion in goods to China in 2024 while importing $438.9 billion, underscoring the importance of the trade relationship. Trump also urged China to open its market to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Two men in England, Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, have been convicted of criminal damage for cutting down the iconic Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland in September 2023. The tree, believed to be around 200 years old, was a beloved landmark near Hadrian's Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Crown Prosecution Service stated that the men recorded a video of themselves cutting down the tree and relished the public outcry they caused. The National Trust expressed gratitude for the conviction, emphasizing the strong connection between people and natural heritage, and the men are slated to be sentenced on July 15.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is holding a bail hearing for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate detained by ICE after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, alleging she criticized Israel. Ozturk's lawyers argue her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, as she is among international students accused of criticizing Israel or participating in pro-Palestinian protests. Tufts president Sunil Kumar defended Ozturk, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her. Ozturk alleges she has suffered multiple asthma attacks in ICE detention and received limited medical attention, and a judge will weigh the merits of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a former Supreme Court Justice nominated by George H.W. Bush, has died at the age of 85. Souter, a New Hampshire Republican, became a key member of the court's liberal wing during his 19 years on the bench, often disappointing conservatives. Known for his preference for solitude and intellectual pursuits, Souter retired at 69 to return to New Hampshire, creating a vacancy filled by Sonia Sotomayor under President Barack Obama. The New York Times article emphasizes Souter's evolution on the court and his commitment to constitutional principles.</p>

The article describes how the exhibit examines themes like ownership, disguise, freedom, and respectability through both historical garments and contemporary designs from brands like Louis Vuitton and Balmain.

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on specific goods traded between the two countries. Tariffs on UK car imports have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 cars annually, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped, though quotas may apply. While the UK will allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free, the government insists that hormone-treated beef will not enter the UK. The agreement does not affect the UK's digital services tax, and negotiations on pharmaceuticals are ongoing.</p>

          <p>Ron Chernow's biography, "Mark Twain," delves into the life of the celebrated American author, revealing a man prone to gullibility, emotional immaturity, and financial misadventures, contrasting sharply with the wise and witty persona conveyed in his writings. The article notes that Twain's personal life was marked by a series of bungles, calamities, and family tragedies, which deeply affected his later works. Despite his struggles, Twain produced enduring literary achievements, including "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," though his transformation from a Southerner to a New Englander left him spiritually homeless. The review highlights Twain's later years, marked by bitterness and cynicism, as a reflection of his personal losses and disillusionment.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK have struck a preliminary trade deal that cuts tariffs on British-made cars, eliminates duties on steel and aluminum, and opens the UK market to American farmers. While not a comprehensive trade agreement, the deal aims to smooth trade ties between the two countries, with the UK reducing tariffs on US ethanol to zero. However, Britain maintains its ban on US chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, and outstanding issues on pharmaceuticals and the digital services tax remain. The deal may serve as a roadmap for other countries seeking to reverse Trump's tariffs, including China.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts are unsure of the exact location where the half-ton spacecraft will crash or how much of it will survive reentry. Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While the risk to humans is low, the spacecraft's potential impact is being monitored by space debris-tracking experts, and the possibility of debris impacting aircraft is a growing concern.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has granted refugee status to 54 white Afrikaner South Africans, who are expected to arrive in Washington D.C. on Monday, according to media reports. The move follows an executive order signed by Donald Trump in February, directing the government to grant refugee status to Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and French colonizers, citing discrimination. The speed at which refugee status was granted is faster than normal, with officials arranging a charter flight to transport the Afrikaners.
