The magnitude 4.2 tremor caused a partial collapse that killed one worker and trapped the five others at a depth of over 900 meters. State-run operator Codelco has halted all operations at the world's largest underground copper mine while about 100 rescue workers attempt to reach the miners.

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are set to face Spain in a warm-up match as they finalize preparations for the upcoming Rugby World Cup. While Spain is not expected to pose a significant challenge, the game offers a crucial opportunity for players on the fringe of the squad to secure their positions. Head coach John Mitchell is using the match to assess talent and solidify his lineup, particularly in key positions like fly-half and the back row. The team aims to build on their momentum and inspire the nation, similar to the recent success of England's women's football team.</p>

Born in the UK, Badenoch spent her childhood in Nigeria and the US before returning to England at age 16 due to the political and economic climate. She explained on a podcast that while she is Nigerian by ancestry, her identity is now British, as her life and family are in the UK. Badenoch, who previously faced criticism from Nigeria's vice president for her comments about the country, noted that her early experiences there shaped her conservative political views.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, resulted in the deaths of four people, including a bartender and three patrons. The incident is the ninth mass murder in the United States for the year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Authorities have identified 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, an army veteran who lived next to the bar, as the suspect and initiated a large-scale search.

          <p>Cambodia's government has announced it will nominate former U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in brokering a ceasefire to end a border conflict with Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol praised Trump's efforts, which included threatening to halt trade negotiations until the fighting ceased. The conflict had resulted in at least 43 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people before a ceasefire was reached. This follows similar nominations for Trump from officials in Israel and Pakistan for his involvement in other international conflict resolutions.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato back approximately nine million years to a hybridization event involving a tomato ancestor. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists discovered that this ancient crossbreeding was crucial for the development of tubers, the edible part of the potato plant. This research provides new insights into the genetic history of one of the world's most important food crops. The findings, published in the journal Cell, highlight hybridization as a key driver of significant evolutionary traits in plants.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has maintained a lower court's order blocking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting certain patrols in Southern California. The ruling upholds a temporary restraining order that prevents agents from stopping individuals without reasonable suspicion that they are in the country illegally. The court rejected the Trump administration's argument that the injunction would irreparably harm their enforcement efforts, stating the government failed to prove its case.

          <p>As wildfires continue to affect parts of Europe, including Greece and Turkey, travel experts are offering guidance to concerned holidaymakers. Although the UK Foreign Office currently deems it safe to travel to these destinations, travelers should understand their rights regarding cancellations and insurance. Standard travel insurance policies typically cover disruptions only if there is official advice against travel, but some providers offer additional coverage for natural catastrophes. If a holiday is cancelled by the provider, customers are entitled to a refund, but those who cancel on their own may not be covered unless they have specific insurance provisions.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Link Northern China's Increased Flooding to Solar Cycle Activity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have attributed the recent pattern of increased summer flooding in northern China to the influence of the solar magnetic cycle. A study published in the Journal of Climate suggests that decadal changes in solar activity affect the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This solar-driven climate pattern has led to what scientists describe as a "south drought and north flooding" regime. Understanding this connection is considered crucial for improving climate predictions and managing flood risks in China during the summer months.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump, just one day after Trump publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, lower their drug prices. The president sent letters to 17 drug companies, urging them to match the lower prices paid in other countries and giving them a 60-day deadline for commitments. The fundraiser, held at Trump's New Jersey golf club, aimed to raise approximately $25 million for a pro-Trump super PAC. This situation highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry amid ongoing debates over prescription drug costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board hearing has provided new insights into the fatal midair collision between a regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people. Key revelations include that the helicopter's altimeter may have been inaccurate, a known issue that was not considered alarming. Investigators also heard that air traffic controllers at the busy airport were under pressure to "make it work," sometimes pushing safety limits. Furthermore, it was revealed that FAA staff had previously raised concerns about the helicopter's flight path proximity to commercial flights, but no action was taken.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning beachgoers about a significant seasonal rise in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to about ten. The increase is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing stingrays closer to the shore, particularly in an area known as "ray bay" near the San Gabriel River. Experts advise visitors to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish of their presence. If stung, the recommended treatment is to soak the affected area in hot water to break down the venom and relieve pain.</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages after finding the company partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend. The jury determined that Tesla's Autopilot technology failed, contributing to the collision where a Model S struck the couple while the driver was distracted. The plaintiffs' attorney argued that Tesla was negligent for not restricting Autopilot's use to controlled-access highways. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that the driver is solely responsible and that the ruling sets back automotive safety innovation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by the Trump administration's own Environmental Protection Agency indicates that its plan to roll back greenhouse gas emission standards would lead to higher gasoline prices. While the EPA promoted the move as saving consumers money, the underlying data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects increased gas prices due to higher demand for less fuel-efficient vehicles. The report also estimates a loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 under the new policy. The rollback reverses Biden-era policies that encouraged higher fuel efficiency and electric vehicle adoption to limit tailpipe emissions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trade experts are warning that President Trump's executive order to hike tariffs on imports will likely increase consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for businesses. With new baseline tariffs of at least 15% on most countries, the average U.S. tariff rate has risen to 17%, its highest in decades. Economists predict this will lead to higher prices for a wide range of goods, from clothing and toys to cars and furniture, potentially costing the average American household over $2,000 annually. While the administration argues the policy will revive U.S. manufacturing, many experts fear it will cause inflation and sluggish economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
