          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has officially announced his bid for a third term, launching his campaign with a video and a formal event in Chicago. In his announcement, Pritzker highlighted his administration's achievements, including seven balanced budgets, multiple state credit upgrades, and the legalization of marijuana, while positioning himself against the policies of the Trump administration. He outlined future goals such as restructuring education for the AI era and making housing more affordable, though he avoided committing to serving a full term amid speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>Nike has reported that new tariffs will add approximately $1 billion in costs during its current fiscal year, a significant challenge as the company navigates a major business turnaround. The sneaker giant's fourth-quarter profits fell by 86% due to efforts to clear out old inventory and shift its sales strategy back toward wholesale partners. Despite the downturn and tariff pressures, Nike's leadership expressed confidence that the worst financial impacts are over and that business results are expected to improve moving forward, with plans to mitigate costs through supply chain adjustments and price increases.

          <p>The S&P 500 is approaching a record high, demonstrating a significant recovery from a sharp decline in April that was triggered by new tariff announcements. Analysts attribute the rebound to several factors, including easing concerns about trade disputes as negotiations enter a quieter phase and strong performance from the technology sector, particularly AI-related companies like Nvidia. Optimism is also fueled by forecasts of potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this year, which could further stimulate economic activity and investor confidence.

          <p>Following recent U.S. and Israeli military strikes, Iran's primary nuclear facilities have sustained significant damage, though the full extent remains under assessment. The deeply buried Fordo enrichment site was targeted with powerful bunker-busting bombs, while the Natanz facility's underground halls were also hit. The Isfahan site, crucial for uranium conversion, saw its above-ground buildings destroyed. However, experts caution that Iran may still possess significant capabilities, including potentially relocated stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and other undisclosed underground sites, making a diplomatic agreement essential for a long-term solution.</p>

Amid these trends, China is actively working to establish a financial sphere of influence centered on the yuan, which some see as a more promising alternative to the dollar compared to the euro.

          <p>The British government is reportedly preparing to announce significant concessions on its proposed welfare reform bill to avoid a major parliamentary defeat. Faced with a rebellion from over 100 Labour MPs, ministers are expected to agree that planned cuts to disability and sickness benefits will only apply to new claimants, protecting existing recipients. This move represents a substantial climbdown for the government, which had argued the reforms were essential to control rising benefit costs, and it marks the third major policy U-turn in a month, potentially undermining the prime minister's authority.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare public appearance with his wife and their daughter, Kim Ju Ae, to open a new coastal resort, an event that has intensified speculation about his succession plans. Ju Ae, believed to be around 12 years old, is the only one of Kim's rumored three children to have been seen in public, and state media has increasingly referred to her with honorifics like "respected." Her repeated presence at significant state events has led analysts to believe she is being positioned as her father's eventual successor, a notable prospect in the patriarchal dynasty.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured the first direct evidence of a planet outside our solar system since its launch, a significant milestone for the observatory. The exoplanet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn and orbits a young star. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to suppress the star's bright light, revealing the faint planet nearby. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly points to it being a previously undiscovered planet.</p>

          <p>A new survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation reveals that a Fourth of July barbecue for ten people will cost significantly more in California ($90.06) compared to the national average ($70.92). This year's survey, which included California-specific data for the first time, shows Golden State shoppers paying premiums on staples like ground beef, chicken, and hamburger buns. Economists attribute the higher prices to a combination of inflation, supply chain issues, and the impact of tariffs on imported goods, noting that these increased retail costs do not typically translate to higher profits for farmers.</p>
