          <p>Experts at the GITEX Asia 2025 conference discussed the potential for AI to exacerbate inequality in the workplace, with some suggesting companies should focus on upskilling employees and creating new employment opportunities. Others argued that protecting existing employment may not be the right approach and that adapting to the changing landscape is crucial. The Microsoft Trend Index indicates that many leaders are confident in using AI to expand workforce capacity but are also considering headcount reductions. Ethical considerations, such as managing bias in AI data, were also highlighted as important aspects to address. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue the recent offensive has not secured the release of captives and question Prime Minister Netanyahu's objectives. The military plans to operate in new areas and destroy infrastructure, but reports suggest this will not occur until after President Trump's visit. Aid agencies have reported acute shortages of food, water, and medicines, accusing Israel of a policy of starvation, an allegation Israel rejects.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for the reopening of Alcatraz prison to house the most ruthless and violent offenders. He said that when the United States was "a more serious nation" it "did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals". The prison was closed in 1963 due to crumbling infrastructure and high repair costs. A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said it would "comply with all presidential orders".</p>

          <p>An exhibit honoring victims of gun violence has been removed from the headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The exhibit showed the portraits of 120 people killed in gun violence. The Department of Justice (DOJ) suggested it will still honor victims in other ways, but not only of gun violence. The removal has drawn criticism from gun violence prevention advocates, who view it as a political decision by the Trump administration to roll back firearms regulations.</p>

          <p>The death of a 14-year-old boy, believed to be Layton Carr, in an industrial building fire in Gateshead has left his school community heartbroken. Eleven boys and three girls, aged between 11 and 14, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and later released on bail. The fire occurred at Fairfield industrial park, where trespassing and previous fires have been reported. Tributes have been left at the scene, and a GoFundMe appeal has been set up for Layton's mother.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police conducted raids across England, resulting in eight arrests as part of two separate investigations. A "major attack" was being plotted, one that "could have led to an imminent threat to life". The arrests, seven of which were of Iranian men, have led to renewed calls for the government to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. The EU has told British negotiators there can be no access to its crime and illegal migration databases as part of Britain's Brexit reset.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for rejecting his proposal to send U.S. troops to Mexico to help thwart the illegal drug trade, saying she is fearful of the country's powerful cartels. Trump said it was "true" that he proposed sending the troops to Mexico and lashed into Sheinbaum for dismissing the idea. Sheinbaum stated that U.S. troops operating inside Mexico was going too far. Trump said the U.S. military is needed to stem the scourge of fentanyl in the United States.</p>

          <p>Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine, with at least 45,287 people killed. The BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries. Russia lost at least 27 lives for every kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured. Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations.</p>

          <p>Nearly a million people in 17 states face losing healthcare coverage after Aetna's parent company, CVS, announced it would leave the federal insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The decision was made despite surpassing financial expectations. ACA tax credits and other financial incentives, implemented by the Biden administration in 2021, are scheduled to expire next year, leading to higher premium costs for people who enroll through the federal healthcare marketplace. Aetna said it will continue delivering superior service and support to its individual exchange members through 2025 and residual activities in 2026.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist, won the first round of Romania's presidential election, bucking the recent trend of voters punishing candidates seen as friendly to President Trump. With more than 98 percent of the votes cast inside Romania counted, Mr. Simion was far ahead of 10 rival candidates, garnering more than 40 percent. The results ensured Mr. Simion a slot in a runoff on May 18 against the likely second-place finisher, Nicusor Dan, the centrist mayor of Bucharest. Simion is an admirer of US President Donald Trump.</p>

The original vote last year was canceled because of widespread concerns over Russian interference in favor of far-right Calin Georgescu, who has been placed under investigation.</p>

          <p>The Royal Family hopes nothing distracts from VE Day commemorations this week, which fall days after Prince Harry's interview. Events begin on Monday with a military procession through central London after which members of the Royal Family will appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony. The King and Queen are looking forward to the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe and the end to World War Two. This years' VE Day commemorations are the first to take place without any of the royals who were present 80 years ago.</p>
