          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he has not considered pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, as she meets with a top Justice Department official for a second day. Trump deflected questions about his own past association with Epstein, suggesting focus should be on others like Bill Clinton. Maxwell's lawyer described her as a "scapegoat" and expressed hope for a productive interview with the DOJ, asserting she will tell the truth about what happened. The meetings come amid growing pressure on the administration to release files related to the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala pilgrimage center in Karnataka, India, has alleged that temple officials covered up hundreds of murders and sexual assaults over nearly two decades. In a police complaint, the man claimed he was forced to secretly dispose of numerous bodies, many of whom were women and girls showing signs of sexual violence. Following these revelations, the state government has formed a Special Investigation Team to probe the claims. The case has prompted families of missing persons to demand their cases be reopened, while temple authorities state they support a transparent investigation.</p>

          <p>In response to a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional districts in Texas, Democratic state legislators are traveling to California and Illinois to meet with their respective governors. The Texas Democrats are seeking to build opposition to the redistricting push, which they label a power grab orchestrated by former President Trump to gain more House seats. The move highlights the intense partisan conflict as a special legislative session, initially called to address flood relief, is being used for the contentious redistricting process. The trip is intended to draw national attention and find allies in a fight where they have little power within their own state.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are claiming Social Security benefits at the earliest possible age, which permanently reduces their monthly payments for life. This decision is often driven by financial necessity, such as job loss or rising living costs, rather than optimal retirement planning. The article outlines three key strategies to create an income bridge that allows individuals to delay claiming benefits: investing in an annuity for guaranteed income, utilizing a reverse mortgage to access home equity, and maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

SpaceX's vice president of Starlink engineering confirmed the network issue lasted approximately 2.5 hours before service was mostly recovered.

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted its democratically elected president, Niger is grappling with a deteriorating situation marked by economic hardship and suppressed freedoms. The junta has forced many international NGOs to cease operations, leading to significant job losses in a country already struggling with high youth unemployment. Human rights organizations report a severe crackdown on dissent, with the arbitrary detention of former government officials and restrictions on media and civil society. With the military leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a swift return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly unlikely.</p>

          <p>The European Union is preparing a strong response should trade negotiations with the United States fail, with a deadline looming for new U.S. tariffs on EU imports. EU lawmakers have approved a combined list of counter-tariffs on up to 93 billion euros of American goods, which could be implemented shortly after the U.S. measures take effect. While talks are ongoing, uncertainty remains high, with former President Trump stating there is only a "50-50" chance of a deal. In a no-deal scenario, the EU is expected to retaliate with its own tariffs and may consider deploying its anti-coercion instrument, or "trade bazooka." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges of diagnosing and treating depression in later life, a condition often overlooked or misattributed to the normal aging process. Experts note that while symptoms are similar across age groups, older adults may present with more physical complaints, and both patients and doctors can be hesitant to address mental health due to stigma. The piece highlights that depression in the elderly can become chronic if left untreated, especially when combined with other physical illnesses. It also discusses the complexities of treatment, including medication interactions and the exclusion of older adults from crucial research trials.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, represents a significant escalation in his long-standing conflict with the media. The lawsuit, filed over a story about a suggestive birthday card allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, is part of a broader strategy to use the legal system and executive power to punish and discredit news organizations. This article analyzes how Trump has targeted numerous outlets, including CBS, ABC, and NPR, using lawsuits and regulatory pressure.

          <p>The United Nations' human rights chief, Volker Turk, has condemned the UK government's decision to ban the activist group Palestine Action as a "disturbing" and disproportionate misuse of counter-terrorism legislation. The group was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 after its activists claimed responsibility for damaging military aircraft. Turk argued the ban impermissibly restricts the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly for supporters not involved in criminal activity. He also criticized the UK's broad definition of terrorism, which includes serious damage to property, stating it deviates from international standards focused on acts intended to cause death or serious injury.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, a decision he plans to formalize at the United Nations General Assembly in September. The move makes France the largest and most powerful European nation to take this step, adding to the more than 140 countries that already recognize Palestinian statehood. Macron framed the decision as part of France's historic commitment to peace and a response to the urgent need to end the war in Gaza. The announcement was strongly condemned by Israel and rejected by the United States, who view it as a reward for terrorism.</p>

Thailand's acting prime minister warned the fighting, which now involves heavy weapons, could "move towards war." Each country has accused the other of initiating the violence and has reported civilian casualties. Despite calls for an immediate ceasefire from the U.S., China, and ASEAN, Thailand has rejected the need for third-party mediation, insisting on a bilateral solution. The conflict, rooted in a century-old border dispute, has plunged relations between the two nations to their lowest point in over a decade.</p>

          <p>A deputy speaker in the state parliament of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, has stepped down from his leadership role after admitting to drawing a swastika on a ballot paper. The center-left politician, Daniel Born, drew the Nazi symbol next to the name of a candidate from the far-right AfD party during a secret vote. Calling his action a "serious mistake" and a "momentary lapse," Born resigned from his party's parliamentary group leadership but did not give up his seat. The incident prompted widespread outrage and a criminal complaint, as the use of unconstitutional symbols is a prosecutable offense in Germany.</p>

          <p>Drawing on Sarah Jessica Parker's early experience of living on a tight budget, this article provides financial advice for those with fluctuating incomes like freelancers and artists. A financial advisor suggests that instead of extreme daily rationing, workers should build a system that absorbs volatility. The core strategy involves a "bucketing" method, where a percentage of every dollar earned is allocated to different categories like essentials, savings, and taxes. This approach provides more flexibility than fixed-amount budgets. Experts also stress the importance of building a larger emergency fund, ideally six months of expenses, to navigate periods without work. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The future of British fashion chain River Island is in jeopardy as it seeks court approval for a major restructuring plan to avoid collapse. The company intends to close 33 stores and secure rent reductions on 71 others, citing heavy financial losses driven by the shift to online shopping and rising operational costs. Once a high-street giant, the family-owned retailer has struggled against intense competition from online-only brands like Shein and Temu, reporting a £33.2m loss in its latest accounts. The company is confident its plan will be approved, but analysts suggest it faces significant challenges in rebranding and retaining customer loyalty.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board report has concluded that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene "Buzzy" Peltola Jr., the husband of Alaska Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by overloading the aircraft. The investigation found the small plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum weight with moose meat from a hunting trip. Additionally, a set of moose antlers had been improperly strapped to the plane's wing strut, which degraded the aircraft's performance and flight characteristics. The NTSB determined these factors led the pilot to lose control shortly after takeoff, resulting in the fatal crash.</p>
