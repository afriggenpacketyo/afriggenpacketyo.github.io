        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S치nchez has apologized to the Spanish people after a corruption scandal led to the resignation of a senior Socialist party member. S치nchez expressed regret for trusting Santos Cerd치n, who is under scrutiny for allegedly improperly awarding public contracts in exchange for kickbacks. Despite the scandal, S치nchez rejected calls for early elections and affirmed his government's commitment to its political agenda until 2027. He emphasized that the issue is not about him or the Socialist party, but about maintaining integrity in governance. The Prime Minister has asked the Spanish people for forgiveness for his misjudgment in trusting Cerd치n. The article notes the prime minister has faced repeated political crises and once threatened to step down in April 2024 before ultimately deciding to remain in office. The stability score reflects the impact of the scandal on the government's reputation. </p>

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the remaining charge of third-degree sexual assault against Jessica Mann due to a disagreement among jurors. This decision followed a partial verdict where Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of the same charge against Kaja Sokola. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced his office's intention to retry the sexual assault charge, emphasizing the immense power imbalance in the case. Mann expressed her readiness to endure further trials to seek justice and accountability. The article highlights the tension among the jurors during deliberations, including a juror who felt threatened, and the DA also thanked each of the accusers for coming forward and sharing their difficult testimony. </p>

          <p>A recent LendingTree study reveals significant variations in tipping rates across U.S. states, with New Hampshire residents tipping the most and Utah residents tipping the least. The analysis suggests that tipping rates correlate with the frequency of dining out in each state. The study also indicates that East Coast residents generally tip more, while those in the South and Western U.S. tip less. This comes as spending at restaurants and bars has increased, representing a larger portion of Americans' food budgets. The findings highlight the role of tipping in supplementing the income of service workers, particularly given the federal minimum wage for tipped workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeremy Greenberg, head of FEMA's National Response Coordination Center, has resigned, adding to a leadership exodus at the agency less than two weeks into hurricane season. His departure follows Tony Robinson, the regional administrator for FEMA Region 6, and his deputy, Traci Brasher. Sources say these experienced leaders are leaving due to disagreements with the current administration's direction, particularly regarding federal disaster assistance. This comes after President Trump expressed a desire to reduce FEMA's role and shift more responsibility to the states.

          <p>A federal hearing is scheduled to address California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles. Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they deem an unlawful militarization. The state argues that the deployment, ostensibly to assist with enforcing federal immigration laws, exceeds the legal justification. The Department of Justice counters that limiting the military's role would undermine the President's authority and create a "rioters' veto" over federal law enforcement. The case raises constitutional questions about the balance of power between the federal government and the states.</p>

The decision revives a lawsuit by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt, whose home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017. The court unanimously held that the Federal Tort Claims Act permits suits for such abuses, confirming an exception to legal immunity that typically protects the government. Justice Gorsuch noted that Congress has opened the door to liability when officers commit assault, battery, or abuse of process. The ruling is seen as a victory for accountability and justice.</p>

The CBO projects that the nation's highest-paid workers would see the biggest gains from the bill's tax cuts, while middle-income families would experience smaller benefits. Families earning less than $55,000 a year would likely face a net loss due to reduced government benefits outweighing any tax savings.

          <p>The Senate confirmed Billy Long as the next IRS Commissioner, a move that could signal significant changes for taxpayers amid sweeping agency budget cuts. Long, nominated by President Donald Trump, secured confirmation through a party-line vote, despite facing Democratic scrutiny over his Trump loyalties and ties to certain tax credits. During the confirmation process, Long pledged that the IRS would not be politicized under his leadership. The implications of Long's appointment for taxpayers remain uncertain, particularly in light of the agency's reduced resources.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "numbskull" and urging him to lower interest rates. Trump claimed that a two-percentage-point rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion annually, but expressed frustration that Powell has not taken action. He stated that he may have to "force something" if the Fed does not lower rates, despite low inflation. This attack marks the third time in two days that a member of the Trump administration has targeted the central bank leader, escalating pressure on the Fed to ease monetary policy.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's inspector general is reviewing the Trump administration's attempts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The review includes workforce reductions and canceled contracts initiated by Trump's acting CFPB head Russell Vought. The investigation was prompted by requests from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim, who sought to examine the legality of Vought's actions and their impact on the CFPB's mission. The Fed IG office has the authority to examine agency records, issue subpoenas, and refer criminal matters to the Department of Justice, providing independent oversight of the CFPB.
