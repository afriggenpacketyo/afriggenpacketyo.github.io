            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. is pursuing fair trade deals with all countries, despite President Trump's imposition of tariffs that have unsettled global markets. Trump indicated he's not considering pausing tariffs for negotiations and is prepared to veto any bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs. A White House official mentioned the possibility of additional tariffs on China in response to retaliatory measures, potentially raising the total tariff to 104%. The administration maintains that tariffs are a tool to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's 49% tariff on Cambodian goods is unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia. Manufacturers are exploring alternative locations like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia to mitigate the impact. The tariff poses an existential threat to Cambodian factories and workers, with no new orders being placed. While the Cambodian government is working on fiscal policies to alleviate the pressure, supply chain experts anticipate a pause in executive decision-making due to the uncertainty.</p>

            <p>The UK government has declined to endorse a 'buy British' campaign in response to tariffs imposed by the U.S., with Chancellor Rachel Reeves arguing that such a move would be 'inward looking'. The government is considering alternative measures, including reviewing Whitehall procurement rules to favor British firms bidding for government contracts. While stressing support for British producers and manufacturers, officials are wary of escalating trade barriers and prefer negotiating arrangements to mitigate the tariffs' impact. New rules aimed at facilitating government contracts for small and medium-sized British companies were introduced in February.</p>

            <p>President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang membership has sparked legal challenges. A federal judge temporarily blocked the law's use, but the Supreme Court later cleared the way for deportations to resume, mandating judicial review for those subject to removal. The Alien Enemies Act, enacted during a potential war with France, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of enemy nations during war or invasion. The law has been invoked in the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.</p>

            <p>Luke Littler, the darts world champion, experienced a surprising early defeat in the 11th Players Championship, losing 6-3 to Dylan Slevin.

Former world champions Michael van Gerwen and Gerwyn Price also faced first-round exits in the tournament held in Leicester. Slevin raced to a 4-1 lead, and Littler's rally was not enough to prevent Slevin from securing the victory.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has begun revoking the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. using the CBP One app under a Biden-era policy, instructing them to leave the country immediately. Over 900,000 migrants entered the U.S. through this process and were granted immigration parole, allowing them to work lawfully. The administration is sending notices of parole termination and urging migrants to self-deport, warning of potential law enforcement actions. The Department of Homeland Security stated that this action fulfills a promise to secure borders and protect national security.</p>

            <p>Kevin De Bruyne could potentially join Lionel Messi at Inter Miami in Major League Soccer. Inter Miami has acquired De Bruyne's discovery rights, granting them the first opportunity to negotiate a contract with him if he decides to move to the league. Salary constraints and MLS roster rules present challenges, as De Bruyne's current earnings would make him the highest-paid player in the league. However, mechanisms like targeted allocation money and general allocation money could facilitate the move, and there is precedent for star players joining MLS on non-DP deals.</p>

Financial markets and economists anticipate the Bank of England will implement more interest rate cuts to mitigate potential economic downturns. Experts predict that mortgage companies will quickly factor in these expectations, leading to a decrease in mortgage rates.</p>
