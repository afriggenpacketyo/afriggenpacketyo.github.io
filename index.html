          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 20 individuals at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. This ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison, followed protests that caused an estimated £7 million in damages. Protesters held signs stating, "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action," just one day after the group's legal challenge to prevent the ban was dismissed by the High Court. The government's action was prompted by what it called a history of unacceptable criminal damage by the organization.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix with a last-minute lap, narrowly beating out McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just over a tenth of a second. Piastri's teammate, Lando Norris, secured third place, followed by Mercedes' George Russell in a tightly contested qualifying session at Silverstone. Despite a promising start, Lewis Hamilton finished fifth for Mercedes, expressing that a small mistake in the final corner likely cost him a front-row start. The results set the stage for a competitive race, with the top drivers separated by very slim margins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A focus group of 2024 Labour voters in Kent has revealed a prevailing sense of disappointment and frustration with the party's first year in power. Participants expressed that the government has not delivered on key promises, particularly concerning immigration, and criticized its frequent policy U-turns as signs of a lack of clear direction. While some voters showed a degree of sympathy for the challenges faced by the new government, others felt lied to. The discussion also highlighted the growing appeal of Reform UK, with some former Labour supporters considering voting for Nigel Farage's party in a future election.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Reform UK Member of Parliament, has voluntarily given up the party whip following newspaper allegations concerning £70,000 in COVID-19 Bounce Back loans his companies received. The Sunday Times questioned the legitimacy of the loans, suggesting the companies may not have met the required turnover thresholds. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing, stating his business dealings were compliant, but suspended the whip as a "precautionary measure." Reform UK has launched its own internal investigation into the matter, making McMurdock the second of the party's five MPs elected in 2024 to lose the whip.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump's recent threats of retribution against political opponents and critics represent a significant escalation in his assault on democratic norms. In the past week, Trump has publicly targeted figures like Elon Musk, prospective NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, and former official Alejandro Mayorkas with warnings of deportation, arrest, or loss of citizenship. Pro-democracy advocates argue that even if these threats are not immediately acted upon, they create a chilling effect designed to silence dissent. This pattern of weaponizing state power against adversaries is seen as a direct attack on the principles of free speech and the rule of law.</p>

The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti while their case proceeded. A Supreme Court decision ultimately cleared the way for the deportation, ruling that a lower court could not block the removal.

          <p>The proliferation of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to a phenomenon known as "tipflation," leaving many consumers confused and pressured. While tipping has long been customary in certain service situations, new technology now prompts for gratuities in a wider range of transactions, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks. Experts note that these systems often default to higher tip percentages, influencing customer behavior and increasing tip amounts overall. This shift has sparked a debate about when and how much to tip, as consumers navigate feelings of obligation and social pressure in new contexts.</p>

Experts from the Quincy Institute and the Institute for Security and Development Policy argue that Pyongyang may view the U.S. as an unpredictable and untrustworthy actor, thereby eliminating any remaining possibility of denuclearization. This perspective posits that North Korea will likely be driven to further develop and disperse its nuclear arsenal to ensure a credible second-strike capability.

          <p>At Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to monitor the health of the marine ecosystem and challenge negative public perceptions of the animals. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the research team examines shark stomach contents to understand their diet, which serves as an indicator of the bay's overall water quality and ecological balance. The lab's work aims to demonstrate that healthy shark populations are crucial for a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination with sharks, researchers note that securing financial support for this vital scientific work remains a significant challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk is exploring the idea of launching a new political party, suggesting it could strategically target a small number of congressional seats to gain influence in a narrowly divided legislature. Following a public dispute with President Trump over a new spending bill, Musk polled his followers on X about forming an "America Party" to challenge the two-party system. He proposed that by winning just a few key races in the House and Senate, the party could hold the deciding vote on major legislation. This development comes after Musk's recent and contentious role leading a government efficiency task force.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a large-scale luxury beach resort, even as the country remains largely closed to foreign tourists. The sprawling complex, which includes high-rise hotels and numerous amenities, is seen as part of Kim Jong Un's long-term goal to boost the sanctioned economy through tourism. However, following a brief and abruptly halted reopening to Western tourists earlier this year, only Russian visitors are currently expected. Analysts remain skeptical about the project's economic impact, citing North Korea's poor infrastructure and deep geopolitical isolation as major obstacles to developing a thriving tourism industry.</p>

          <p>An Arizona renter is challenging his property management company, Denali Real Estate, after being fined $4,000 for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in his lease, which experts say is likely illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). This federal law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation or financial penalties from businesses. The tenant has filed complaints with state and consumer protection agencies, highlighting a broader issue of companies attempting to silence customer criticism.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with rescue operations continuing for a second day. The building collapsed on Friday, and emergency crews have been using heavy machinery to search for survivors believed to be trapped in the debris. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where lax enforcement of building codes and the use of substandard construction materials often lead to structural failures. This tragedy echoes a similar event in Karachi in 2020, where a collapsed apartment building killed 22 people.</p>

          <p>A physician writing in The Atlantic argues that newly passed congressional work requirements for Medicaid will create insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles for the most vulnerable patients, causing millions to lose their health insurance. The author illustrates this by describing patients who, despite qualifying for medical exemptions, would struggle to navigate the system due to homelessness, lack of internet access, cognitive impairments, or language barriers. Citing projections from the Congressional Budget Office, the article contends that the policy is designed to cut costs by disenfranchising eligible people, which will ultimately lead to disastrous health outcomes and financial ruin for safety-net hospitals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule posits that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, involving hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any prolonged feeling of upset is due to consciously or unconsciously re-engaging with the negative thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose a different focus, thereby preventing rumination and allowing for a quicker recovery from life's daily frustrations.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the central role of hobbies in Danish culture, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies.

She argues that contrary to the belief that one needs to find balance before starting a hobby, the act of pursuing a hobby is what actually creates balance and forces the definition of personal and professional boundaries.</p>

While this number is lower than the previous year, it still far surpasses other states like North Carolina and Arizona, which also saw significant gains. The state's appeal is attributed to its lack of state income, estate, or inheritance taxes, making it financially advantageous for those on fixed incomes. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000. (not investment advice)</p>

Furthermore, advancements in emergency and hospital care, such as portable defibrillators and angioplasty, have greatly increased survival rates.
