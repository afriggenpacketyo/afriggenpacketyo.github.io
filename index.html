          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:36:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups, which presented substantial evidence of unconstitutional tactics, such as targeting individuals based on their race or ethnicity. The order also mandates that federal authorities provide detained individuals with proper access to legal counsel at a Los Angeles facility. This decision comes amid heightened tensions and fear within Latino communities due to an increase in federal immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has imposed an emergency ban on carrying substandard portable power banks onto commercial flights, following several incidents where defective units caught fire. The new rule, effective since June 28, prohibits any portable batteries that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. This has led to confusion among travelers and large piles of abandoned power banks at airports. The measure is part of a broader safety crackdown in Asia, as aviation authorities seek to mitigate the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries during air travel.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have confirmed the arrest of about 200 immigrants during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The operation, which involved criminal search warrants, led to a tense standoff with protesters, resulting in at least twelve injuries and four arrests for assaulting officers. In response to reports of violence, President Trump authorized law enforcement to use necessary force against assailants. One farm worker was critically injured after falling from a roof, though authorities state he was not in their custody at the time of the fall.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the competitive AI talent landscape, hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key personnel. While not an acquisition of the company, Google is paying $2.4 billion for licensing fees and compensation to bring the team to its Google DeepMind division. Windsurf, which specializes in AI tools for writing code, remains an independent entity. This deal underscores the intense "talent war" among major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, all vying to absorb top AI researchers and engineers.</p>

          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, is burning out of control northwest of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, having scorched nearly 11,000 acres. The blaze has forced the evacuation of the park's North Rim and nearby communities, with officials describing it as 0% contained. Dangerous conditions, including extreme heat up to 115°F and gusty winds, are fueling the fire's rapid expansion. The incident highlights a broader wildfire threat across the western U.S., with another national park in Colorado also evacuating staff and visitors due to lightning-ignited fires.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Prospect of Significant Tax Increases Amid "Daunting" Economic Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 20:05:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic data and a stark report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the United Kingdom is facing a gloomy economic future that will likely necessitate significant tax rises. The OBR warned that current government spending promises are unaffordable and that UK debt levels are vulnerable compared to other advanced economies. This assessment, combined with recent economic figures showing a dip in growth, sets a challenging stage for the government's autumn Budget. The chancellor may need to raise taxes by £10-20 billion to stabilize public finances and maintain borrowing limits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will be a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both competing for their first title at the tournament. Swiatek, the world number one, has had to adapt her powerful game to the grass courts, while Anisimova is fulfilling her early potential after taking a break for her mental health. Analysts suggest the match will be decided by who better handles the pressure of the occasion. Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style as the underdog could pose a unique challenge to the more experienced Swiatek.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is championing a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, navigating the complex relationship between the U.S. and China. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interests rather than being defined by traditional alliances. While affirming the importance of the AUKUS security pact and the U.S. alliance, this "Australia first" approach suggests a recalibration aimed at shaping the nation's own future. This strategic shift comes as his government holds a strong political mandate to make bold policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump administration proceeds with its threat to levy a 50% tariff on Brazilian products. President Trump's threat was explicitly linked to the ongoing criminal trial of his political ally and former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, which Trump called a "witch hunt." Lula's firm stance, supported by Brazilian congressional leaders, raises the possibility of a trade war. The move by the U.S. is seen by many as an unprecedented use of trade policy to interfere in another nation's judicial affairs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl trafficking and its own retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the move. This represents a significant escalation in trade policy with one of the United States' largest trading partners. The threat is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to negotiate with numerous countries, unsettling global trade dynamics and creating economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale federal raid on the Glass House cannabis facilities in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties resulted in the detention of nearly 200 people, including minors. The operation sparked chaos as workers fled, leading to injuries and a standoff between protesters and agents who deployed tear gas. The event has fueled dueling political narratives, with the Trump administration highlighting the arrest of undocumented immigrants and alleged child labor, while farmworker advocates decried the action as a terrorizing tactic against a legal business. The incident places a spotlight on the complex intersection of immigration enforcement, labor practices, and the state-legal cannabis industry.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's threat of a new 35% tariff, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing questions about his strategy for handling the aggressive U.S. trade policy. Carney, who won an election vowing to be assertive with the U.S., has recently made concessions, such as scrapping a digital services tax, which some critics argue have yielded little benefit. While his government maintains strong domestic support and many experts urge patience, the latest tariff threat intensifies the pressure on Carney to secure a favorable trade deal. The situation highlights the challenges Canada faces in negotiating with an unpredictable U.S. administration. (not investment advice)</p>
