          <h2>PBS Sues Trump Administration Over Attempt to Cut Funding</h2>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging his executive order to cease federal funding for the public broadcaster, arguing that it violates the Constitution and federal telecommunications law. The lawsuit accuses Trump of retaliating against PBS for perceived political slights in its news coverage and asserts that the order undermines public television's editorial independence and autonomy. PBS maintains that the president is legally barred from interfering with its funding or content, citing protections of speech and press freedom. The White House contends that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is using taxpayer money to support a particular political party, justifying the funding cuts. The lawsuit aims to protect PBS's ability to provide unbiased news and educational programming. Optimism for the lawsuit's success is tempered by the current political climate and the administration's stance on media funding.</p>

          <p>Canadian officials are warning of challenging conditions as they battle growing wildfires in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with hot and dry weather forecasted for the weekend.

Smoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts in Canada and parts of the U.S. Upper Midwest, including Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

Investors and union members are eager to learn more about the details of the deal, which Trump has described as a "partnership" that will keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment from Nippon. While Trump claims the deal will be controlled by the U.S., the White House and the companies have provided limited details, and Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick suggests the U.S. government will have a "golden share" to ensure production levels are maintained. The deal remains subject to scrutiny and negotiation.</p>

Trump stated that Musk's work has been unparalleled in modern history, despite DOGE's savings falling short of the promised $1 trillion. Musk, who was limited to 130 days of service, will remain involved as a friend and advisor to the president. The White House claims DOGE's efforts have saved roughly $170 billion, though some analyses suggest potential costs to the government due to lost productivity and workforce changes.</p>

He is alleged to have provided logistical support and assisted in attempts to financially benefit from Manzano's stolen assets, with police stating that a car used by another suspect was rented under Anderson's name.

Reyes reportedly submitted to a handwriting test that did not match the handwriting in the letter, and he was involved in a dispute with another man who wanted to get him deported to avoid testifying against him.

          <p>A columnist for the Los Angeles Times criticizes President Trump for his attacks on judges, arguing that they undermine faith in the judicial system and potentially incite violence. The article highlights the rise in threats against federal judges since Trump took office and notes that some judges are considering forming their own armed security force. Trump's pardons of convicted criminals are also criticized as a disregard for the evidence-based convictions of judges and juries. The author calls on Chief Justice Roberts to condemn the invective against judges more forcefully, emphasizing the courage required to uphold the law in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times explores the connection between therapy culture and declining fertility rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has created an impossible standard for parenting, leading to a dread of parenthood. The piece argues that the expectation for parents to be accountable for their children's mental health and happiness well into adulthood contributes to the trend of childlessness. The author posits that the high standards to which the current generation holds their own parents may be a reason why they are hesitant to become parents themselves.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that denying visas to Chinese students could backfire on America. While protecting borders from espionage is essential, the piece suggests that denying students solely because they are Chinese and wish to pursue STEM degrees in the United States is counterproductive. The article suggests that such restrictions could harm American innovation and competitiveness in the long run.</p>

          <p>Republican Sen. Joni Ernst defended proposed cuts to Medicaid at a town hall in Iowa, responding to concerns that the cuts could threaten the lives of individuals who lose access to healthcare by stating, "Well, we all are going to die." Ernst argued that the focus should be on those who are most vulnerable and meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, while those who are working and have the opportunity for benefits elsewhere should receive them there. The proposed cuts are part of a massive spending package that Republicans are working to move through Congress, with the aim of creating savings in Medicaid by targeting waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>

          <p>Gruesome details have emerged in the investigation of an alleged bitcoin torture case in New York City, involving the kidnapping and beating of an Italian man for his cryptocurrency fortune. Two cryptocurrency investors, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault, and unlawful imprisonment, and prosecutors say the suspects threatened to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin. The man, who was allegedly shocked with electric wires, hit on the head with a gun, and forced to smoke crack cocaine, managed to escape after being held captive for over two weeks.</p>

          <p>The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, is requesting more information on President Trump's recent pardons from the new U.S. pardon attorney, alleging that the traditional clemency system has been replaced with "favors to the President's loyal followers and most generous donors." Raskin claims that the pardon attorney's office is doling out pardons as favors, ignoring the thousands of individual applications in the normal process. He argues that the new criteria for granting pardons appear to be personal and political loyalty to President Trump, substantial financial contributions, and engagement in political corruption.</p>

One business owner describes the situation as "killing" them, while another says they're "relieved" by the ruling but still making adjustments to their operations due to higher costs.
