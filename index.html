            <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the U.S. needs to keep coal plants open to meet the increasing electricity demand from AI data centers and other industries. He emphasized that halting the closure of coal plants is essential for meaningful growth in America's electricity production over the next five to ten years. These comments align with President Trump's plan to sign an order classifying coal as a critical mineral, aiming to expand electricity output by 25% and prioritize coal extraction leases on federal lands. Coal accounted for approximately 16% of U.S. electricity generation in 2023, a significant decrease from 51% in 2001.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court agreed to temporarily block a lower court order that mandated six federal agencies to rehire over 16,000 probationary workers who had been previously terminated. The Trump administration sought the stay to continue its efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.

            <p>President Trump is advocating for reciprocal tariffs, which would impose the same taxes on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports. While a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners has already taken effect, the reciprocal levies are scheduled to follow. Experts warn that implementing perfectly reciprocal tariffs would be administratively complex and could lead to retaliation from other nations. The White House has also announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to trade imbalances with the U.S., potentially driving up consumer prices as businesses pass on added costs.</p>

            <p>President Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on goods imported from the rest of the world, claiming they will boost the U.S. economy and protect jobs. Tariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries, typically a percentage of a product's value. These measures could harm the world economy, push up prices for consumers, and cause volatility in stock markets. Trump's minimum 10% tariff on all imports to the U.S. has been introduced, with much higher tariffs on individual countries set to follow.</p>

            <p>With increasing concerns about a potential U.S. recession following President Trump's new tariff regime, individuals are advised to build up a financial buffer.

Economists caution that widespread saving and deferred purchases could exacerbate the recession. Government intervention and central bank actions will be critical in mitigating the impact.</p>

Companies that pay dividends often signal confidence in their future and offer a more predictable return for investors (not investment advice).</p>
