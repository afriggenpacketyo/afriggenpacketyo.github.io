          <p>The children's commissioner for England is advocating for a government ban on AI applications that generate sexually explicit images of children. Dame Rachel de Souza emphasizes the need for a total ban on "nudification" apps, which use AI to edit photos to make individuals appear naked, disproportionately targeting girls and young women. The government has stated that child sexual abuse material is illegal, with plans for additional offenses related to AI tools designed for creating such content, but Dame Rachel argues this doesn't go far enough and nudifying apps should be completely banned.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine faces a critical juncture in its conflict with Russia, marked by fluctuating hopes for peace talks and anxieties over potential reductions in American military aid, the Ukrainian Army is increasing its reliance on domestic drone technology. The "Line of Drones" initiative focuses on assembling unmanned systems within Ukraine, primarily small exploding drones deployed from concealed locations. This strategy underscores Ukraine's attempt to maintain its defense capabilities in the face of uncertain international support, as conflicting signals emerge from the Trump administration regarding future arms shipments and peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is reintroducing the "PELOSI Act," a bill that would ban members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks while in office. This renewed effort comes as the proposal gains bipartisan support, with President Trump indicating he would sign such a ban if passed. The legislation aims to prevent lawmakers from profiting from non-public information, allowing them to invest only in diversified mutual funds, ETFs, or U.S. Treasury bonds. Violators would be required to surrender profits to the U.S. Treasury and could face fines from ethics committees.</p>

          <p>Brood XIV of periodical cicadas, known for their loud buzzing and synchronized emergence, is set to appear across the eastern United States in 2025. Primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, the brood is also expected to emerge in smaller pockets along the East Coast. The timing of the emergence is linked to soil temperature, with cicadas typically exiting the soil when it reaches 64 degrees.</p>
