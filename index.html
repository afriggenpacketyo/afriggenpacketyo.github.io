        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing increasing regulatory and trade pressures in the United States, Temu and Shein are strategically pivoting towards European markets, particularly the UK and France, where they've significantly increased advertising spending. Data indicates a decrease in consumer spending on these platforms in the U.S., while growth has been observed in the EU and UK. However, these companies are encountering regulatory challenges in Europe similar to those in the U.S., including stricter regulations on product safety, consumer protection, and potential duties on small-value packages. These challenges could reshape their operations in Europe over the next few years as they navigate the complexities of compliance and operational transparency. Optimism regarding the long-term success of this shift is tempered by the regulatory hurdles and competitive landscape in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has expressed its concerns to the United States following an incident in Los Angeles where an Australian Nine News correspondent, Lauren Tomasi, was seemingly targeted and shot with a rubber bullet while covering protests against immigration raids. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that such an event is unacceptable and confirmed he spoke with Tomasi, who reported being sore but otherwise well. Tomasi emphasized the importance of continuing to report on critical stories, highlighting the role of journalists in covering significant events. The incident raises questions about the safety of journalists covering protests and the measures in place to protect them.</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 calendar for 2026 will see the debut of the Madrid Grand Prix, which will be held as the final race of the European section of the season, from September 11-13, replacing the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola in Italy. This change is part of a broader effort to streamline transport and reduce carbon emissions within the F1 schedule. Other adjustments include moving the Canadian Grand Prix to May 22-24 and Monaco to June 5-7 to improve freight efficiencies by following the Miami race.

          <p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge aims to innovate with a focus on a thinner and lighter design, measuring just 5.8mm thick and weighing 168g, which sets it apart from other high-end smartphones. The device features a 6.7-inch Oled screen, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, and runs on Android 15 with Samsung’s One UI 7. However, the slim design results in a smaller battery, leading to shorter battery life compared to other Samsung models, and it lacks a telephoto lens in the camera system. Despite these trade-offs, the S25 Edge offers a unique user experience with its lightweight feel and is supported by software updates until 2032.</p>

          <p>Okinawa commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, the bloodiest conflict in the Pacific war, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 Japanese and Americans, including around 90,000 civilians. Takamatsu Gushiken, a volunteer "bone hunter," continues his decades-long mission to uncover and identify the remains of those who perished, aiming to return them to their families. The island remains a critical strategic location, hosting a significant portion of U.S. troops in Japan, amidst ongoing tensions in the region. Despite Okinawa's return to Japanese control in 1972, the U.S. military presence persists, creating a complex dynamic between the local population and the U.S. military.</p>

Jennifer Beidel, a former assistant U.S. Attorney, suggested that Jane's testimony could be powerful if the jury finds similarities between her experiences and those of Cassie Ventura, adding credence to Ventura's claims. Jane testified about Diddy's alleged violent behavior, including an incident where he allegedly put her in a chokehold after punching and kicking her, and the jury was shown video evidence of her injuries. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to anti-immigration protests has been criticized as an overreach of federal power and a step towards authoritarianism. California Governor Gavin Newsom has accused Trump of intentionally causing chaos and terrorizing communities, while human rights lawyer Philippe Sands warns of a slow creep towards normalization of such tactics. The protests erupted following ICE raids in Los Angeles, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The situation has raised concerns about the balance of power between the federal government and state authorities, and the potential erosion of civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A voluntary recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA to Class II due to mislabeling, as the cans contain the full amount of sugar found in regular Dr Pepper, approximately 39 grams. The recalled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina with a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and product code XXXXRS05165. This poses a health risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as consuming the mislabeled product could lead to hyperglycemia or diabetes-related ketoacidosis.

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in Europe's classification of ketamine to smuggle the drug, often swapping it for substances like salt during transit, with at least 28 similar consignment switches uncovered in Belgium since 2023. The preferred route involves shipping ketamine from India through Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, before reaching the UK, where consumption has risen dramatically. The dual classification of ketamine as a legitimate anesthetic and an illegal recreational drug complicates law enforcement efforts, requiring international cooperation to tackle the issue. German police are collaborating with Indian authorities to address the problem, monitoring new psychoactive substances like ketamine.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower the elevated prices of rice, a staple food in Japan. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the released rice to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government initiated stock releases.

          <p>Israel is preparing to deport a group of activists, including Greta Thunberg, who were detained aboard a Gaza-bound aid boat, transferring them to Tel Aviv airport for deportation. The yacht, carrying 12 people aiming to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, was intercepted by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition stated that all campaigners are being processed by Israeli authorities and may be permitted to fly out of Tel Aviv soon. The boat set sail from Italy on June 1 to raise awareness of starvation conditions in Gaza and deliver aid, including rice and baby formula.</p>

The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without explicit, informed consent from each individual.

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in global fertility rates, attributing it to factors such as the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners. Surveying 14,000 people across 14 countries, the UNFPA found that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The report emphasizes that many individuals feel unable to create the families they want, marking a shift in the agency's focus towards addressing low fertility issues. Financial limitations were cited as a significant barrier, with 39% of respondents globally indicating this as a reason for not having more children.</p>

Data from the CDC indicates a drop from over 31,000 deaths in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024, attributed to factors like wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl, and reduced substance use among teens. The trend is particularly notable among teenagers, with 40% fewer fatal overdoses, although some clusters still show slight increases.
