          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey. Her defense claimed the shooting was a tragic accident that occurred while they were playfully mimicking cartoon characters, specifically an Elmer Fudd routine about an empty gun. Prosecutors argued she intentionally shot him twice in the head while he slept, a theory supported by firearms and blood spatter experts. After an initial mistrial, a second jury found her guilty, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life, highlighting how different trial strategies can yield vastly different outcomes.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity killing in Cardiff, his sister is publicly appealing to the fugitive suspected of ordering the attack. Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, allegedly hired two hitmen who went to the wrong address and fatally stabbed the schoolboy. Aamir's sister, Nishat Siddiqi, urged Ege to hand himself in, stating he is not truly free while living a life on the run. The two men who carried out the attack are serving life sentences, but the family continues to seek full justice.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Wipha has forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people across southern China as it prepared to make landfall in Guangdong province. China's Meteorological Administration issued an orange alert, the second-highest warning level, anticipating wind speeds exceeding 150 km/h (93 mph). The storm has already impacted Taiwan and the Philippines and brought strong winds and heavy rain to neighboring Chinese provinces and Hong Kong. Authorities evacuated over 12,000 people from the sea and relocated more than 266,000 residents on land in preparation for potential extreme downpours and flooding.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week places a spotlight on major European banks like Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank, with markets anticipating a resilient earnings season for the financial sector. Analysts expect this quarter to show positive year-on-year growth, largely driven by these banking giants, even as other sectors face downgrades. Concurrently, the European Central Bank is expected to maintain its current interest rates. However, this decision is overshadowed by the looming threat of potential U.S. tariffs, which could force the ECB to cut rates in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a complex Wisconsin murder investigation, data from a Fitbit and a Google Dashboard played a pivotal role in solving the 2016 death of Nicole Vander Heyden. Initially, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but his Fitbit data corroborated his alibi by showing minimal activity during the time of the murder, leading to his exoneration. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify another man, George Steven Burch. Data from Burch's phone, tracked by Google Dashboard, placed him at all key locations related to the crime, ultimately leading to his conviction for the murder.</p>

This breakdown allows atrocities to be justified and prevents consensus on peaceful resolutions. The author criticizes the public's willingness to overlook moral failings, which ultimately perpetuates a global state of conflict.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, murder charges have been filed against two suspects. Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, is accused of being the shooter, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, is accused of being the getaway driver. Moreno was playing video games in his bedroom in November 2021 when he was struck by a bullet that came through his window. A recent breakthrough using enhanced surveillance video and police sketches led to the suspects' arrests, bringing the case a step closer to justice.</p>
