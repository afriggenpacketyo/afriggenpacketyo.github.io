          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of offering citizenship to foreign investors based on real estate investments, deeming it a "mere commercial transaction." Anti-corruption activist Manuel Delia, who campaigned against the program, celebrated the decision as a vindication of the work of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a murdered Maltese journalist. The court argued that EU citizenship requires a "genuine link" with the country, fostering solidarity and mutual trust among member states, which financial commitment alone cannot establish. While Malta's Prime Minister Robert Abela stated the scheme had earned Malta over â‚¬1.4 billion, the ruling has led to the program being reworked to align with the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Voters in South Texas have overwhelmingly approved the formal organization of Starbase, the home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company, as an official city. The vote, with 212 in favor and 6 against, solidifies Musk's vision for the area as a hub for space exploration. Starbase serves as the facility and launch site for SpaceX's rocket program, contracted with the Department of Defense and NASA, aiming to return astronauts to the moon and eventually travel to Mars. While SpaceX officials have emphasized the need for the city to manage roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care, critics express concerns about Musk's potential control over local resources and beach access.</p>

          <p>Kenyans are facing increased payroll taxes and new levies on essential goods as President William Ruto attempts to stabilize the country's finances and manage its $80 billion debt. These measures have significantly reduced the take-home pay of salaried workers, leading to widespread discontent and concerns about declining purchasing power. With a large portion of the population living in poverty and a significant informal sector, the tax burden falls disproportionately on those with formal employment. The situation is exacerbated by rising import costs due to the falling value of the shilling, prompting fears of renewed protests similar to those that occurred last year.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, potentially disrupting the country's traditional two-party political system. The Conservatives suffered losses, while Labour was punished by voters unhappy with spending cuts and tax increases. Reform U.K.'s surge in support reflects a broader disenchantment with the main parties and a rise in nationalist politics. This fragmentation of the electorate is challenging both Labour and the Conservatives as they compete with smaller parties on the left and right, making British politics increasingly unpredictable.</p>

Supporters, including President Trump, praise the bill as a victory for students and parents, while Texas Democrats argue it will harm public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier families already in private education.

          <p>A small plane crashed into two homes in a Simi Valley neighborhood, resulting in the deaths of the pilot, a passenger, and a dog. The aircraft, a Vans RV-10, had taken off from William J. Fox Airfield in Lancaster and was en route to Camarillo Airport. Residents were evacuated from both two-story homes, which sustained fire and structural damage, with no reported injuries on the ground. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, focusing on the pilot, the aircraft, and the operating environment.</p>

          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long battle for justice after the 1979 murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly impacted victims' rights in California. After Steven Burns, Catina's former boyfriend, was convicted of second-degree murder, the Salarnos fought tirelessly to keep him behind bars during numerous parole hearings. Their advocacy led to changes in state law, allowing victims to give impact statements at sentencing and ensuring children have support when testifying. The family's journey has transformed them into advocates, with Nina becoming a prosecutor specializing in domestic violence cases and Harriet founding Crime Victims United.</p>

As detectives uncover a history of domestic abuse and control, they begin to suspect that Kendy's death was a staged murder. A second autopsy revealed that the gunshot was not the cause of death, but rather asphyxiation, suggesting that her husband used a carotid restraint hold, a technique he learned as a state trooper.</p>
