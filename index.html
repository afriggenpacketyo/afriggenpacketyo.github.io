            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been found guilty in her federal bribery trial, mirroring her husband's earlier conviction on similar charges. Prosecutors successfully argued that the couple acted as "partners in crime," accepting cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for political favors. The defense maintained that there was no concrete evidence linking Nadine to her husband's illicit activities. She faces sentencing in June, the same month her husband is scheduled to begin his 11-year prison term.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump convened a meeting with top retail executives from Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's to discuss the potential impact of his proposed tariff plans on their businesses. The retailers expressed their concerns about how the tariffs could affect their import-heavy business models and potentially raise prices for consumers. The companies released nearly identical statements afterwards, noting that the meeting was productive and that they remain committed to delivering value for American consumers. Tariffs pose a significant challenge to retailers already grappling with consumer sensitivity to prices after years of inflation.</p>

            <p>Salesforce shares faced a significant downturn following an analyst downgrade by D.A. Davidson, who cited concerns that the company's focus on its Agentforce AI offering is coming at the expense of its core business. The analysts believe Salesforce is neglecting its core business to place a "premature" bet on artificial intelligence. While acknowledging the strategic importance of AI, the firm expects growth in Salesforce's other applications to decelerate, leading to weak performance for the stock. Despite the downgrade, Jim Cramer maintains a longer-term positive outlook on Salesforce's AI initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline following President Donald Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump called Powell "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates preemptively to boost the economy. The president's remarks, which defied the norm of political independence at the Fed, added to market turmoil already fueled by concerns over Trump's tariff plans and fears of an economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all saw significant losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022.</p>

The new policy will apply to packages sent from any foreign country to U.S. consumers, while business-to-business shipments over $800 will continue but may face delays.

            <p>King Charles has expressed his and Queen Camilla's "heavy hearts" following the death of Pope Francis, paying tribute to his "compassion" and "tireless commitment" to people of faith. The King noted that their sorrow was eased by the Pope's ability to share an Easter greeting with the world shortly before his passing. The couple had met the Pope during a state visit to Italy earlier this month, a meeting they remember with "particular affection." Cardinal Vincent Nichols echoed the King's sentiments, describing the Pope as a voice for the dignity of every human being.</p>

            <p>NASA's Lucy spacecraft has transmitted images from its recent asteroid flyby, revealing a long, lumpy asteroid resembling an irregular bowling pin. The asteroid, named Donaldjohanson, is larger than initially anticipated, measuring approximately 5 miles long and 2 miles wide at its widest point. The flyby served as a dress rehearsal for future asteroid encounters closer to Jupiter. Lucy was launched in 2021 to study the unexplored Trojan asteroids near Jupiter, with eight Trojan flybys planned through 2033.</p>

            <p>Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin testified in a defamation trial against The New York Times, stating that a 2017 editorial about gun control had a devastating impact on her life.

Although the Times published a correction, Palin said it did not restore her reputation and left her feeling defenseless.

            <p>The US supreme court heard arguments in a case that could threaten Americans’ access to free preventive healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. At issue is the constitutionality of the US preventive services taskforce, which plays a critical role in determining which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients. If the justices uphold the lower court’s ruling, health associations said in a filing, life-saving tests and treatments that have been cost-free would become subject to co-pays and deductibles, deterring many Americans from obtaining them.</p>

            <p>The "magic number" needed to retire comfortably has fallen to $1.26 million, but Americans are increasingly less confident in their ability to reach that goal. Market volatility and economic uncertainty have contributed to a decline in retirement confidence. Workers are largely on their own when it comes to retirement security, which has also taken a toll on retirement confidence. The shift toward relying on retirement savings heightens the importance of grounding yourself in a financial plan as early as you can. (not investment advice)</p>
