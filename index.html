          <p>Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets has achieved a rare feat by winning both the Hart Trophy as NHL MVP and the Vezina Trophy as the league’s best goaltender, marking the first time a goalie has accomplished this since Carey Price in 2015. Hellebuyck led the Jets to the Presidents’ Trophy for the best regular season and the William Jennings Trophy for the fewest goals allowed, although they lost in the second round of the playoffs to Dallas. Other award recipients include Nikita Kucherov, who won the Ted Lindsay Award, and Leon Draisaitl, who won the Rocket Richard Trophy. Hellebuyck is only the sixth goalie to win both the Hart and Vezina trophies in the same year.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, especially with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining low. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, all eyes are on whether Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats, particularly as approval ratings for his Cabinet sometimes dip below the widely viewed "danger level" of 30 percent. Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, particularly those unaffiliated, and major issues at stake include rising living costs, political funding scandals, child-rearing, and regional concerns. Around 300 candidates are running in the election, making it the highest number of candidates in more than 30 years.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles after interrupting her update on immigration operations. Padilla, attempting to ask questions about DHS's immigration enforcement actions, was escorted out of the room, reportedly forced to the ground and handcuffed before being released. Noem stated that she was unaware of Padilla's identity and did not receive a request for a meeting, while DHS officials claimed Padilla was mistaken for an "attacker" and resisted law enforcement. Politicians, including Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, have condemned the incident, with Bass criticizing Noem's description of L.A. and questioning the recognition of a sitting senator, especially the first Latino senator from California.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are increasingly focusing on overseas expansion to ensure their survival amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the United States. Despite a temporary truce in the tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain subject to tariffs as high as 3,521 percent. To mitigate these challenges, Chinese firms are diversifying their production bases, with a significant portion of planned overseas capacity expansion directed towards the Middle East and Africa, followed by the U.S. and Europe. This strategic shift aims to localize production abroad, making exports viable despite high tariffs.</p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike, protesting what they describe as unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing these workers announced that members voted overwhelmingly in favor of granting their leaders the authority to call a strike. This action could potentially disrupt operations for two of the nation's largest grocery chains during their busiest season. Key issues in the contract negotiations include staffing levels, which the union claims have negatively impacted service and working conditions, and allegations of union-busting tactics by the companies. Negotiations are scheduled to resume later this month.</p>

Despite the challenging conditions at Oakmont, with treacherous rough and glass-like greens, Reed's shot propelled him up the leaderboard.

          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings that this could be costly and disruptive, potentially increasing the risk of catastrophic fires during peak wildfire season. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts currently divided among multiple agencies, with a proposed budget for a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department. This shift would involve transferring personnel from the Forest Service, raising concerns about disruptions, especially as fire season is already underway, and the order makes no mention of climate change. Critics argue that restructuring firefighting efforts could increase the likelihood of large catastrophic fires.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy for blood cancer, which delivers toxic drugs directly inside cancer cells. This therapy, known as belantamab mafodotin, has been shown to halt the progression of myeloma for nearly three times longer than current treatments, while also reducing side effects. The drug works by attaching a chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets plasma cells, allowing it to be absorbed by cancerous cells and release its toxic payload. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this therapy can halt the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with existing treatments, offering a significant improvement in patient outcomes.</p>

Buyers have described misleading claims about rental income, steep increases in site fees without warning, and pressure to sell caravans back to parks at significantly reduced prices. Some owners have reported receiving veiled threats after seeking legal advice to recoup their losses. Industry insiders highlight that agreements between caravan buyers and sites are covered by private contract law, which often favors the park and leaves buyers with limited recourse against unfair practices.</p>

          <p>A nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report indicates that the House-passed budget reconciliation bill promoted by the Trump administration would disproportionately benefit higher earners, while reducing resources for lower-income Americans. The CBO's analysis reveals that between 2026 and 2034, after-tax federal benefits would decrease for households at the bottom of the income distribution, while those in the middle and top would see increases. The top 10% of earners are projected to receive the highest tax cuts under the proposed bill. The budget bill, which faces opposition from Democrats, faith leaders, and social service advocates, is expected to face challenges in the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against federal immigration sweeps has sparked controversy and criticism. The move, overriding the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom, has been described as an escalation of Trump's previous pledges to use troops to suppress protests. Critics, including former military leaders, argue that this action politicizes the military and sets a new precedent, while the Trump administration maintains it is necessary to restore order and protect ICE officers. Newsom has called Trump's intervention a "brazen abuse of power" that inflames a "combustible situation."</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that President Trump's megabill would reduce resources for the poorest U.S. households by approximately $1,600 per year, while households in the top 10% would gain about $12,000 per year. The report highlights the bill's disproportionate impact on different income levels. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump are defending the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles, amid objections from Democrats about their domestic deployment. Preparations are underway in Washington for a massive military parade to mark the Army's 250th birthday.</p>

          <p>Shinjiro Koizumi, Japan's farm minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, has returned to the political spotlight by pushing to lower rice prices amid rising household burdens. This move, reminiscent of his father's style, comes after Koizumi finished third in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race, with analysts suggesting his communication skills and resemblance to his father could benefit the LDP in the upcoming national election. Koizumi has taken steps to release government stockpiled rice at reduced prices, drawing attention to controversial issues in the agricultural sector, and some analysts believe this could position him as a strong contender for future leadership. His efforts are viewed as a potential lifeline for the LDP.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement that he would restore Confederate names to military bases, the Pentagon has stated that the bases will instead be named for other veterans with the same surnames. This discrepancy reveals the administration's intention to honor Confederate figures while avoiding direct acknowledgment. The original names were replaced after a careful process, and the new honorees appear to have been chosen based on superficial criteria. This decision has been criticized as an insult to those whose names were added and then removed, and it highlights the administration's broader campaign against efforts toward racial equity and reconciliation.</p>

          <p>Elected officials in California are urging FEMA and the Newsom administration to fund soil testing on properties destroyed in the recent wildfires, citing public health risks and financial burdens for survivors.

State legislators are recommending that California environmental regulators step in and conduct soil sampling if federal agencies continue to resist. Despite initial concerns, the Newsom administration now appears to be downplaying the risks of lingering contamination, even as soil sampling has revealed elevated levels of lead and arsenic.</p>
