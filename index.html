            <p>After a three-day market sell-off triggered by President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, stocks rebounded Tuesday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experiencing significant gains. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments to CNBC, suggesting that the Trump administration is actively negotiating tariffs and could reach "good deals," boosted investor confidence. However, analysts caution that the tariff overhang remains a threat to long-term economic growth and could lead to increased inflation and a potential recession. Corporate earnings season is beginning, with major banks and Delta Air Lines set to release their latest results this week. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is headlining a major donor event for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), aiming to raise at least $10 million as Republicans prepare for a tough 2026 midterm election battle. The NRCC chair, Rep. Richard Hudson, acknowledges the Democrats' fundraising advantage but expresses optimism due to the number of Democratic-held seats in districts Trump carried. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has released its initial target list, aiming to win back the House majority, accusing Republicans of harming the economy and abandoning constituents.

He also noted that Japan has expressed eagerness to negotiate, and he expects other countries with large trade deficits to follow suit.

            <p>A bipartisan group of California lawmakers is urging the Trump administration to preserve $1.2 billion in federal funds for the ARCHES hydrogen energy project, aimed at weaning the state off fossil fuels. The project, awarded by the Biden administration, also plans to attract $11.2 billion in private investment. Lawmakers emphasize ARCHES' role in securing American energy dominance, creating jobs, and lowering energy costs. The potential cuts are viewed as partisan, as similar projects in Republican-leaning states are reportedly safe from defunding.</p>

China is expected to capitalize on the situation, portraying itself as a steadfast ally and signing economic agreements with countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia.
