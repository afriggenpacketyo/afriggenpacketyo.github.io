          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any peace decisions made without Ukraine's participation will be ineffective and counterproductive. Responding to a planned summit between U.S. and Russian leaders, Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not concede land to end the conflict. His comments underscore Kyiv's anxiety about being marginalized in high-stakes negotiations, particularly after suggestions that a deal might involve territorial swaps. Meanwhile, fighting continues, with recent Russian drone strikes causing multiple casualties in southern Ukraine.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 50 demonstrators at a protest in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw numerous individuals display signs with messages backing the banned organization. This action makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government banned Palestine Action following acts of significant criminal damage, including an incident at an RAF base, though the group is challenging the proscription in court.</p>

          <p>The recent execution of Byron Black in Tennessee has drawn severe criticism, with witnesses describing it as "horribly, horribly wrong" and amounting to torture. Black, a 69-year-old with multiple severe health issues and an intellectual disability, reportedly cried out in pain and said "It hurts so bad" after the lethal injection began. His attorney and journalists present noted he repeatedly lifted his head in distress before being pronounced dead. The incident has intensified scrutiny over the state's execution methods and the legal loophole that allowed his execution despite a law change prohibiting it for intellectually disabled individuals.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the conventional notion that a "beach read" must be a light or frivolous book, arguing that vacation can be the perfect time for any type of literature. It suggests that readers might use their downtime to either escape with fun stories or finally tackle denser, more complex works they lack the mental space for during their daily lives. The piece serves as a gateway to several curated book lists, offering recommendations for readers looking to redirect their attention, get lost in a story, or navigate new phases in life.</p>

          <p>A theory gaining traction suggests that any movement of the 1 million bitcoins belonging to the mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto could signal a grave threat to cryptocurrency. This event might indicate that quantum computers have become powerful enough to break the encryption protecting older, more vulnerable Bitcoin wallets. According to a Deloitte analysis, about 25% of all Bitcoin is susceptible to such an attack. The potential movement of Satoshi's coins could trigger either a wave of new investment or, more likely, a massive panic sell-off across the crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a revival by replacing vacant anchor stores with unconventional tenants like churches, entertainment complexes, and popular bookstores. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly and drives business to remaining retailers. This strategy of 'reprogramming the box' diversifies the mall's offerings, creating community hubs that attract visitors for reasons beyond traditional shopping. Industry data suggests this trend is leading to a tangible increase in foot traffic at enclosed malls nationwide.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the strategic Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a project designed to connect the country's far western and southwestern regions. A new state-owned company has been established to oversee the construction, which will link the existing line in Tibet with a new route from Hotan in Xinjiang. This railway is a key part of China's ambitious plan to create a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, enhancing transportation and economic integration across the vast and remote territory.</p>

          <p>Travelers can avoid unexpectedly high cell phone bills abroad by taking a few key steps before and during their trips. Experts recommend comparing the international plans offered by carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile, with the latter often providing more inclusive roaming options for basic use. For heavy data users, purchasing a local or international eSIM from providers like Airalo can be a much cheaper alternative. Additionally, leveraging free Wi-Fi and pre-downloading maps and guides for offline use can significantly reduce the need for costly cellular data.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent books on the future of food are highlighting a critical and brutal trade-off: to save the planet's remaining wild ecosystems, agriculture must become more intensive to produce more food on less land. This logic leads to a controversial defense of factory farming, which, despite its cruelty, is highly efficient in terms of land use compared to pastoral or organic methods. The authors argue that as the global population and demand for meat grow, 'sustainable intensification' becomes a necessary evil to prevent catastrophic deforestation and climate change, challenging popular ideals about food systems.</p>

          <p>A captain with the Los Angeles County Fire Department is facing multiple felony charges for allegedly faking a work-related injury to fraudulently collect over $25,000 in disability insurance payments.

          <p>Stargazers may be disappointed this year as the peak of the annual Perseids meteor shower is expected to coincide with a full moon. According to NASA, the bright moonlight on the night of August 12th into the 13th will likely wash out the view of all but the brightest meteors. The Perseids, which originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, are one of the most popular meteor showers due to their summer timing. While viewing conditions are not ideal, patient observers in the Northern Hemisphere may still catch a few fireballs in the pre-dawn hours.</p>

Officials cited procedural rules and liability concerns, stating that such installations require holistic studies and ADA-compliant curb ramps. The incident sparked public outcry and a debate over government inefficiency, with critics pointing to it as an example of bureaucratic red tape hindering simple, common-sense improvements.

          <p>A legal analysis questions the basis for Texas Republicans asking the FBI to help locate Democratic state legislators who fled to prevent a vote on a partisan redistricting plan. The author argues that the FBI's jurisdiction is limited to federal crimes, and the lawmakers' actions do not constitute a federal offense; the state-issued warrants are civil, not criminal. Any substantive FBI involvement would therefore be a lawless overreach of its authority, transforming the agency into a political tool for the party in power and setting a dangerous precedent for American democracy.</p>
