          <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to South Africa signifies a diplomatic push to counter Russia's influence in Africa, especially as Ukraine's relationship with the US under President Trump becomes strained. Trump has paused military aid and criticized Zelenskyy, creating a need for Ukraine to seek legitimacy internationally. Ramaphosa's willingness to meet with Zelenskyy is also significant, as South Africa faces its own pressures from the Trump administration. This meeting underscores a realignment of international relationships as nations seek new allies in a changing global order.</p>

Despite the government's efforts to transition away from fossil fuels, wholesale electricity prices remain high due to the influence of international gas prices. The structure of the electricity market, the costs of upgrading the grid, and the need for backup power sources contribute to the high costs.

          <p>Unpredictable US trade policies could push countries to strengthen ties with China as a hedge against instability, according to Joshua Meltzer, a Brookings Institution trade policy expert. Meltzer suggests countries are seeking alternatives to mitigate exposure to Trump's policies. China is likely to capitalize on this moment to become the preferred alternative partner. The trend's outcome depends on whether the Trump administration can stabilize its trade policies.</p>
