          <p>North Korea plans to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia's Kursk region, signaling deepening cooperation between the two nations. This move follows previous reports of North Korea supplying combat troops and weapons to support Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. Russian officials state that the North Korean personnel will assist in restoring infrastructure in the Kursk region after alleged incursions. Kim Jong Un has expressed unwavering support for Russia's efforts to defend its sovereignty, leading to concerns from the U.S., South Korea, and Japan about potential technology transfers from Russia to North Korea. The U.S. State Department has voiced concerns over Russia's continued use of North Korean workers and soldiers, viewing it as a means for Pyongyang to obtain desperately needed funds.</p>

The Group of Seven (G7) launched an action plan to reduce critical mineral supply chain risks, addressing overdependence on China. Ishiba noted the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japanese firms, while China criticized the G7's market-distorting practices allegations. Kim Jong Un and Russian security official Sergey Shoigu discussed matters agreed upon with Vladimir Putin, and Ishiba pledged Japan's support for Ukraine's peace efforts, with Japan hosting a landmines conference.

          <p>Following Donald Trump's renewed focus on immigration enforcement, ICE raids in Southern California have become more aggressive, creating fear within the undocumented community. Despite assurances from Tijuana officials, activists warned against underestimating Trump's policies, citing his increased power. ICE operations have expanded, with reports of mass raids planned in Los Angeles, causing widespread concern among immigrants. One incident at a Home Depot saw ICE agents, along with local law enforcement, pursuing and arresting numerous individuals, leading to community outrage and fear. While deportations haven't been massive, the anti-immigrant sentiment has deterred many from seeking to enter the U.S., and those already here live in constant anxiety.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team has signaled a shift in its trial strategy, requesting less time to present its case as prosecutors prepare to rest. Legal experts suggest this change may indicate perceived weaknesses in the prosecution's case, which relies heavily on testimony from former associates. Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, with a potential sentence of 15 years to life if convicted. The defense may be emphasizing the prosecution's burden of proof and highlighting inconsistencies in the testimony. The trial has seen the presentation of videos and text messages related to alleged misconduct, and the judge has cautioned both sides against violating a sealing order.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a critical step towards its 2030 lunar ambitions. The modular spacecraft, designed for both near-Earth and deep-space missions, underwent a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The test involved igniting the spacecraft's escape engines while grounded, followed by a clean separation of the return capsule and deployment of parachutes. This safety measure ensures crew survival in case of rocket failure during launch, marking China's first such test since 1998, advancing its space exploration capabilities.</p>

The Co-op is nearing full recovery from the attack, which involved hackers accessing its technology networks and stealing member data.

          <p>Australia is set to become the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to increase the donation pool by 625,000 people. The new rules will ask all donors about anal sex with new or multiple partners, requiring a three-month wait to donate blood if the answer is yes, but allowing plasma donation. These changes aim to reduce stigma and boost plasma supplies, while research indicates no impact on blood safety, though some argue the approach is more conservative than other countries.</p>

          <p>Dozens more parents are calling for an inquiry into maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust after a BBC investigation revealed concerns about inadequate care. These families experienced issues such as babies dying or being injured, and women suffering trauma due to inadequate care. Whistleblowers have also shared concerns about the standard of care at LTH maternity units, citing a culture where staff are afraid to raise concerns. The trust says it is taking steps to make improvements, including investing in its workforce and strengthening its culture. The latest families to contact the BBC want an independent review into the trust's maternity services, but the Department of Health and Social Care is finalising measures to strengthen leadership and build a culture rooted in safety.</p>

The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade factors, leading to a decline in domestic corporate profits.
