          <p>Hollywood Forever Cemetery has unveiled a new five-story mausoleum to address the high demand for burial space in Los Angeles. The Gower Mausoleum provides crypts for approximately 13,000 people, offering a vertical solution to land scarcity in the city. The structure is designed with marble, natural light, and views of L.A. landmarks, aiming to provide a peaceful resting place for the deceased and a comforting space for visitors. The cemetery, known for hosting community events like movie nights and yoga, continues to innovate in death care services, with two floors of the new mausoleum already sold out.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has announced plans to move Palestinian civilians to southern Gaza in preparation for a new military offensive. According to COGAT, the military agency handling humanitarian aid, the supply of tents and shelter equipment will resume to facilitate the relocation. This move is part of a broader strategy articulated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to eliminate Hamas and eventually transfer governance to Arab authorities. Meanwhile, families of the 50 remaining hostages held by Hamas are calling for a nationwide protest, fearing the expanded operations will further endanger the captives.</p>

          <p>The popular children's accessory chain Claire's has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland after struggling with declining sales and intense competition from online retailers like Shein. For decades, the store was a cultural touchstone for tweens, known for its affordable jewelry, ear-piercing services, and glittery products. However, analysts suggest the brand has failed to keep pace with rapidly changing social media trends and cannot compete on price with fast-fashion giants. As consumer habits shift, with younger shoppers now influenced by older social media creators and premium brands, Claire's traditional market has eroded significantly.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field during a preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams after sustaining a significant hit. The injury occurred on the team's opening drive as Johnston attempted to catch a pass from quarterback Justin Herbert. After being attended to by medical staff on the field, he was able to stand and walk before being transported for further evaluation. Johnston, who is expected to be a key part of the Chargers' offense this season, had 55 catches for 711 yards and eight touchdowns in the previous year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing hot weather, parts of the United Kingdom are showing signs of an early autumn, such as leaves changing color and fruit ripening ahead of schedule. Experts attribute this phenomenon, sometimes called a "false autumn," to the stress placed on trees and plants by a prolonged period of heat and drought. While some gardeners and farmers have seen early harvests, conservationists are concerned about the long-term impact on wildlife. Animals that rely on seasonal fruits and insects for food may struggle as these resources appear and disappear outside of their normal cycles, disrupting the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A photo of a homeless man, Bill Theodie, posted by President Trump on social media preceded a swift clearing of his encampment in Washington D.C. The president had called for the immediate removal of such encampments, and days later, Mr. Theodie and others were forced to leave as a bulldozer dismantled their belongings. This action is part of a broader administration plan to remove homeless encampments from public parks in the nation's capital, offering shelter placement but also threatening fines or jail time for refusal. The personal account highlights the human side of the policy, as individuals like Mr. Theodie express a desire for safe places over shelters.</p>

          <p>A group of students preparing for their GCSE exams have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021. The letters, written just after a major COVID-19 lockdown, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from personal goals to whether face masks would still be needed. The exercise provides a poignant look at how the pandemic shaped the secondary school experience for this cohort, who faced remote learning and 'bubble' restrictions. The students reflected on their personal growth and resilience over the past four years, with many still holding onto the ambitions they documented.</p>

          <p>During his summit with Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump hand-delivered a letter from First Lady Melania Trump concerning the children affected by the Russia-Ukraine war. The letter vaguely implores the Russian president to "restore their melodic laughter" and protect the innocence of children, without explicitly mentioning the alleged abduction of thousands of Ukrainian children by Russia. This issue is a major point of international concern, with the International Criminal Court having indicted Putin for his alleged role in the war crime. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the matter of forcibly deported children.</p>

The riots began earlier in the week in two separate prisons, led by members of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs. The inmates were demanding the return of ten gang leaders who had been transferred to another facility and placed in solitary confinement. The situation had escalated, with one prison official being shot and killed on Friday during the unrest. This incident follows a similar hostage situation earlier in the week where eleven other guards were freed by anti-kidnapping teams.</p>

While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's gains reflect its strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is under threat from the Trump administration and corporate interests who seek to weaken its regulations. While the law has successfully helped some species like elephant seals and gray whales recover, many marine mammals still face significant dangers from climate change, pollution, ship strikes, and entanglement in fishing gear. The article refutes the argument that the act should be scaled back, pointing to the declining North Atlantic right whale population and the recent crash in gray whale numbers as evidence of ongoing crises. It concludes that protecting marine mammals is essential for the overall health of the ocean.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has shifted his public stance on ending the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than a preliminary ceasefire. In a social media post, Trump stated that a permanent peace deal is the "best way to end the horrific war," arguing that ceasefires often fail to hold. This marks a significant change from his previous calls for a rapid ceasefire. The new position aligns more closely with a reported offer from Putin that would involve Ukraine ceding territory, a proposal that President Zelenskyy is being urged to consider at an upcoming meeting in Washington.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced an immediate halt to the issuance of all visitor visas, including medical-humanitarian visas, for people from Gaza. The department stated it is conducting a "full and thorough review" of the procedures for granting these visas. The decision follows social media campaigns from far-right activists who claimed, without evidence, that a humanitarian group was using the program to bring security threats into the U.S. The move has been condemned by civil rights organizations like CAIR, which called the policy "sheer cruelty" and warned it will put the lives of critically injured children at risk.</p>

          <p>After a brief period of cooler, more humid weather allowed firefighters to gain ground on several large wildfires, Southern California is preparing for another week of high heat and elevated fire danger. The National Weather Service warns that hot, dry conditions will return starting Monday, with temperatures expected to top 100 degrees in some inland areas by Thursday. This weather could fuel new ignitions and challenge crews who have been working to contain major blazes like the 132,000-acre Gifford fire. While containment has improved significantly on recent fires, the forecast indicates that the region is not yet clear of significant wildfire risk.</p>

          <p>Six prominent Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner, have sent an open letter to President Trump urging him to reconsider a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI chips to China. The arrangement, announced by Trump, permits the sales in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of the revenue. The senators expressed "serious alarm," arguing that the deal trades away America's competitive technological edge and could strengthen China's military systems. The White House dismissed the concerns, criticizing the senators for their past inaction on the issue during the previous administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump is reportedly backing a peace plan that would involve Ukraine ceding the unoccupied parts of its Donbas region to Russia. According to European officials familiar with a post-summit call, Trump relayed Putin's offer to freeze the current frontlines in exchange for Ukraine withdrawing from the remainder of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This position represents a significant break with Ukraine and its European allies, who maintain that international borders must not be changed by force. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington to discuss the proposal.</p>

          <p>Norfolk Police arrested thirteen individuals in Norwich for displaying support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The arrests occurred during a protest outside City Hall, where individuals were holding placards in support of the group, which is a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act 2000. This action is part of a wider crackdown, with London's Metropolitan Police announcing that hundreds have been arrested since the ban took effect on July 5. Human rights groups like Amnesty International have expressed concern over the mass arrests, while Palestine Action is legally challenging its proscription in the High Court.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian political analysts and commentators have expressed deep disappointment with the Alaska summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, viewing it as a public relations success for Russia with no concrete benefits for Ukraine. Experts noted that the meeting allowed Putin to appear on the world stage alongside the U.S. president, effectively undermining his international isolation without requiring any concessions. Many Ukrainians were angered by the formal reception Putin received, including a red carpet at a U.S. military base, which they felt legitimized a leader responsible for war crimes. The summit is seen as having created more uncertainty rather than bringing peace closer.</p>

The comeback was led by captain Harry Wilson, who scored two tries and was instrumental in turning the tide at the breakdown.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has commended President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts, stating they have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. The statement was issued after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which did not result in a ceasefire agreement but did pave the way for further talks involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Starmer emphasized that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement and reaffirmed the UK's "unwavering support" for Kyiv. He also stated that until Russia ends its "barbaric assault," allies will continue to tighten sanctions on its war machine.</p>

          <p>A Denver man was scammed out of $17,000 after his call to the official United Airlines customer service number was mysteriously transferred to a fraudulent agent. The man, Dan Smoker, was rebooking a canceled flight and spent over three hours on the phone with an agent who took payment for a new ticket. Call logs confirm he initially dialed the correct United number, but the airline's internal records show only a 12-minute call, leaving it unexplained how he was rerouted to a scammer. The incident highlights a sophisticated new type of airline scam where even customers who follow correct procedures can be victimized.</p>
