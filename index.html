          <p>President Trump is deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles following unrest sparked by ICE raids targeting undocumented migrants, resulting in numerous arrests and clashes between residents and federal agents. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused ICE of sowing terror, escalating tensions between local and federal authorities. The White House cited attacks on ICE officers as justification, while the FBI issued warnings to protesters about obstructing operations. The situation underscores ongoing conflicts over immigration enforcement and federal-state relations, especially in California where a significant portion of the population is Hispanic, with the population of Paramount being more than 80% Hispanic. The National Guard has been authorized to help halt the 'invasion of illegal criminals' into the United States.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests following ICE operations that led to the arrest of 118 immigrants, including 44 in a single day, prompting President Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops. The demonstrations erupted in areas like Paramount and Compton, with protesters clashing with law enforcement, leading to the use of non-lethal munitions. Advocates for immigrants' rights reported detentions outside businesses, and SEIU regional president David Huerta was among those arrested during the protests. Governor Newsom condemned the federal government's actions as inflammatory, while Mayor Bass expressed concerns about ICE's tactics; Trump defended the deployment as necessary to address lawlessness. The events highlight deep divisions over immigration policy and enforcement in Los Angeles, with the use of Title 10 authority by the president being a key point of contention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority has sparked legal debate, with critics like Erwin Chemerinsky arguing it's a chilling use of the military to suppress dissent. Title 10 allows for federal activation of the National Guard, but its use without the governor's request is rare and controversial. Concerns have also been raised about potential invocation of the Insurrection Act, which could further federalize military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The ACLU has warned against the dangerous implications of using the military for immigration enforcement, while Governor Newsom has criticized the deployment as inflammatory. The situation raises questions about the balance of power between federal and state governments in managing civil unrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in childcare and household chores could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, threatening its economic stability. The study highlights traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes and further pushing China's overall fertility rate to an estimated 1.1 children per woman.</p>

          <p>Nutritionists are cautioning that intermittent fasting, while popular, can mask disordered eating behaviors and increase the risk of developing eating disorders. Registered dietitian Becky Mehr notes that it can serve as a socially acceptable disguise for restrictive eating, as scheduled fasting requires skipping meals and ignoring hunger cues. Dr. Anne Marie Oâ€™Melia adds that any form of caloric restriction significantly increases the risk for individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Experts recommend focusing on balanced meals, intuitive eating, and listening to one's body rather than adhering to rigid food rules.</p>

          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will retire its original emoji set after 26 years, marking the end of an era for a visual language that shaped digital communication. The Docomo emoji, introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, gained immense popularity in Japan and later globally. The company stated that the emoji have "fulfilled their role" as Google's emoji have become more prevalent worldwide. The new mobile phones will adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead, signaling a shift in digital expression.</p>
