          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded in what authorities are calling a deliberate ambush in Idaho. The incident occurred as crews responded to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain, which investigators believe was set by the suspect to lure them to the location. A tactical team later found the body of the suspected lone gunman near the scene following an exchange of gunfire, bringing an end to the active threat. The event has been condemned as a heinous assault on emergency responders.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is awaiting a critical court verdict that could nullify its recent party congress. A ruling against the CHP would invalidate its new reformist leadership, including chairman Ozgur Ozel, and potentially reinstate the former, long-serving leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu. This legal challenge, initiated by the party's old guard, is seen by some analysts as a strategic maneuver by President Erdogan to weaken and divide the increasingly popular opposition. The outcome could plunge the party into chaos and significantly impact Turkey's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms, a move that has prompted the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The decision came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users a "blatant attack." Prime Minister Mark Carney's office confirmed that he and President Trump spoke and agreed to restart the talks, aiming for a resolution by a July 21 deadline. The reversal is seen as a key concession to ease trade tensions between the two neighboring countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian reflects on the victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary, contrasting his progressive political success with the intense Islamophobic and racist backlash that followed. The author argues that high-profile political figures and commentators have engaged in a smear campaign, baselessly labeling Mamdani an extremist for his left-wing economic views and pro-Palestinian stance. The piece contends that this reaction reveals a mainstreamed prejudice against Muslims in public life, particularly those who challenge established political orthodoxies. It suggests the vitriol is a defense mechanism against a growing movement for change.</p>

          <p>Jens Spahn, a leading politician from Germany's conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary group, has called for Europe to develop its own nuclear deterrent in response to Russian aggression. Spahn argued that the U.S. nuclear weapons currently stationed in Germany are no longer a sufficient deterrent and that Europe must become capable of defending itself. He proposed German or broader European participation in the nuclear arsenals of France and the United Kingdom, a suggestion that drew immediate criticism from left-leaning coalition partners. The proposal ignites a significant debate on Germany's long-standing security policy and its role within European defense.</p>

          <p>Recent market speculation has positioned British oil major BP as a potential acquisition target, a significant shift for the century-old company.

The abrupt 2023 departure of CEO Bernard Looney, the architect of the green transition, further fueled uncertainty about the company's direction.

          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion, or yokozuna, Onosato has declared his ambition to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament in his debut at the sport's highest rank. Achieving this feat would place the 25-year-old in an elite group, as only six wrestlers have ever won their first tournament after being promoted to yokozuna. Onosato is the first Japanese-born wrestler to reach the rank since 2017, bringing significant attention and expectation. He also expressed his desire to energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was heavily impacted by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year.</p>

This radicalization is occurring in regions that have faced economic collapse and depopulation since German reunification, despite significant investment.

The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 49.7, remaining below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from growth. This comes despite government stimulus efforts and is exacerbated by a domestic price war and sluggish consumer demand, with consumer prices mired in deflation. While new export orders showed some improvement, the overall data points to significant economic headwinds and pressure on Beijing to implement further stimulus measures. (not investment advice)</p>

However, British farmers have criticized the agreement, arguing that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip to secure the deal for the auto industry.

Instead of providing military aid to Tehran, Moscow offered only platitudes and calls for mediation.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and researchers are beginning to understand why. Studies indicate that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs are a key factor, particularly the function of regenerative braking. This system, which recharges the battery by slowing the car, creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness in passengers. Researchers are now exploring solutions, including engineering adjustments and even using specific audio tones, to counteract the effect and improve the comfort of riding in an EV.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team has suffered a setback as Wales scrum-half Tomos Williams has been ruled out of the remainder of the tour of Australia with a hamstring injury. Williams sustained the injury after scoring a try in the team's victory over Western Force in Perth. His departure is a significant blow, as he was recently named the Premiership player of the season. Scotland's Ben White has been called up from his international duties in New Zealand to join the Lions squad as a replacement.</p>
