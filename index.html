          <p>A New York Times article explores the phenomenon of military simulations in the U.S. where participants, including a 17-year-old aspiring Army recruit, re-enact modern conflicts like the war in Ukraine. MilSim West, a company organizing these events, stages battles between NATO and Russian forces, attracting hundreds of players who pay to participate in the immersive experiences. While organizers claim the simulations are purely fantasy, participants often draw inspiration from real-world conflicts for their uniforms and equipment, sometimes even purchasing gear from military surplus stores with items salvaged from Ukrainian battlefields. The article highlights the dissonance between the simulated and actual war, raising ethical questions about the hobby's connection to ongoing global conflicts.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas's Gaza chief and brother of Yahya Sinwar, has been "eliminated" by the Israeli military. Sinwar was reportedly the target of an Israeli strike on May 13 in Khan Younis, which the military claimed destroyed Hamas's underground infrastructure, though Hamas has not confirmed his death. Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, was reportedly killed by Israeli troops last October. The accuracy of Netanyahu's statement remains unconfirmed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, increasing it by 21%, compared to a 12% increase from a $500,000 income and 18% from $1 million in assets. The study found that people with $2,000 in emergency savings spend approximately two hours less each week worrying about their finances. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa emphasizes the importance of readily available funds for unexpected expenses, contrasting this with retirement assets that have withdrawal restrictions and penalties. The article notes that saving even small amounts regularly can help build an emergency fund, but also acknowledges that obtaining $2,000 may be difficult for low-income individuals.

Artistic director Evelyn Meining emphasizes that true friendship requires trust and mutual understanding, something not replaceable by social media followers. The festival also highlights artistic friendships, such as the collaboration between Nils Mönkemeyer and William Youn, who commissioned a new piece by Manfred Trojahn for the event. The festival aims to dispel clichés, such as the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri, and to explore the role of music as a medium of friendship.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized the Republican spending bill, asserting that it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in reducing wasteful government spending. Musk stated that the bill, which is projected to increase the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, will not help the nation's finances. DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion in taxpayer money since January by targeting government waste and redundancy, resulting in approximately 275,000 government layoffs. Musk has stepped back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies, noting that the federal bureaucracy is "much worse than I realized."</p>

An apparent propellant leak then caused the spacecraft to spin, ruling out a controlled reentry and splashdown.

The incident, involving a Ford Galaxy, occurred on Water Street, injuring 79 people, with seven remaining hospitalized. The suspect is also being questioned on suspicion of dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs, with police confirming the incident is not terror-related. Detectives are reviewing CCTV footage to determine the vehicle's movements before the incident, while Water Street has reopened following cleanup efforts.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles police officer testified in Sean Combs’s federal trial about a trespassing incident at the home of Scott Mescudi (the rapper Kid Cudi), stating that he observed a Cadillac Escalade with a license plate registered to Bad Boy Productions, Inc. leaving the scene. The officer, Chris Ignacio, said he and a partner were called to the location at about 8:20 a.m. on Dec. 22, 2011, for a possible burglary at the home, up winding, narrow roads in the Hollywood Hills. Jurors are also expected to hear testimony from a former personal assistant of Mr. Combs who prosecutors say was coerced into sex with the mogul, and who is being identified in court only by the pseudonym “Mia.” Combs is charged with racketeering and sex trafficking, and has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

          <p>Hawaii will increase taxes on hotel rooms and vacation rentals to raise funds for addressing the climate crisis, becoming the first government in the U.S. to impose such a levy. The tax is expected to generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects such as replenishing Waikiki beaches, promoting hurricane clips for roofs, and clearing flammable grasses. The measure adds an additional 0.75% to the daily room rate tax and levies a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills. With the new law, visitors will pay nearly 19% on their accommodations, but the governor believes tourists will welcome committing dollars to protect the environment.</p>

Analyst Julian Mitchell attributes GE Vernova's success to being earlier in a potential upcycle for revenue and orders, with a larger backlog compared to its competitors. Recent deals, such as the $14.2 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia and Trump's support for the U.S. nuclear power industry, have also contributed to GE Vernova's surge. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest pursuing credit card debt forgiveness this June due to high interest rates and the slow decline of credit card rates. With the average credit card interest rate well over 21% and overall balances totaling $1.18 trillion, consumers may find debt forgiveness a viable option. It's recommended to start the process sooner rather than later, as it can take 24 to 48 months to complete, and delaying increases the compounding interest. Credit card debt forgiveness is also considered less damaging to credit scores compared to defaulting or filing for bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>
