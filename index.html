          <p>President Trump's newly announced tariffs have caused a surge in import activity, as businesses rush to beat the deadlines.  However, this frontloading is accompanied by a concerning decline in new freight orders, signaling a potential slowdown in consumer demand.  The higher-than-expected tariff rates, particularly the 34% increase for China, have negatively impacted markets, leading to widespread uncertainty.</p>
