          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot at a Utah Valley University event, prompting a manhunt for the shooter. Eyewitnesses reported a single gunshot during his outdoor debate, causing panic among the 3,000 attendees. President Trump confirmed Kirk's death, ordering flags to half-staff and calling it a "dark moment for America." Authorities are investigating the incident as an assassination, with the suspect believed to have fired from a nearby rooftop. This tragic event highlights the growing concerns about political violence in the United States.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley indicates that over 90% of US investors are willing to increase their exposure to Chinese stocks, marking the highest interest level in five years. This reversal from a multi-year retreat is attributed to China's sector leadership, efforts to stabilize its economy, improved liquidity, and a desire for diversification from US assets. Investors are particularly keen on areas like humanoid robotics, biotech, and new consumer companies, extending their interest to onshore markets via A-share ETFs and index-future products. Morgan Stanley suggests this capital inflow is just beginning, with more significant allocations expected over time as investors conduct due diligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US pharmaceutical giant Merck (MSD in Europe) has abandoned a planned £1 billion expansion of its UK operations, moving life sciences research to the US and cutting over 100 UK jobs. The company stated that successive UK governments have not invested enough in the life science industry and undervalue innovative medicines. This decision follows similar actions by other pharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca and Novartis, which have also cited the UK's declining competitiveness and pressure from the US administration to invest domestically. The move is considered a significant blow to the UK's ambition in the life sciences sector.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah underscores the escalating political violence plaguing the United States. This incident, occurring as Kirk debated political opponents, is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks, including attempts on Donald Trump's life and shootings of state legislators. Experts warn that increasingly divisive rhetoric, amplified by social media and easy access to firearms, is creating a dangerous environment where violence begets violence. The event prompts a reevaluation of security measures for public figures and raises profound questions about the future stability of American politics.</p>

The day of remembrance, traditionally a symbol of national unity, comes amidst increased political tensions following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

          <p>China's Rocket Force has banned 74 bid evaluation experts and 116 suppliers from procurement projects following a corruption investigation. Some entities were stripped of qualifications for all PLA projects, with violations dating back to 2016. This intensive review of the military equipment procurement sector began after the downfall of former defense minister Li Shangfu in 2023. The Rocket Force, established in 2015, oversees critical assets like strategic nuclear missiles, making integrity in its supply chain paramount for national security and military modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated that a recent US immigration raid on a Hyundai factory in Georgia was "bewildering" and could deter future South Korean investments in the US. The raid, which detained approximately 300 South Korean workers, was the largest single-site anti-immigration operation since President Trump's return to office. Lee emphasized that South Korean businesses might now question the risks of direct operations in the US, despite a major trade agreement recently made between the two nations.

          <p>Under David Moyes' second tenure, Everton has undergone a significant transformation, avoiding relegation and rising to fifth in the Premier League. The club made a record net spend of £97 million this summer, recruiting nine players, including marquee loan signing Jack Grealish. This financial turnaround is attributed to non-existent spending in previous years, profitable player sales, and the Friedkin Group's takeover, which converted debts into equity. The strategic shift in transfer policy, focusing on suitable players and leveraging increased revenues from the new Hill Dickinson Stadium, aims to rebuild the club and potentially target a first trophy since 1995.</p>

This strategy, seen across brands like Prada and Celine, leverages high gross margins in beauty and taps into the 'treatonomics' trend, where shoppers splurge on smaller luxuries.

          <p>A new report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Idea (IDEA) reveals that global democracy continued to weaken in 2024, with over half of 173 surveyed countries showing declines in key indicators. Significant drops were observed in credible elections, access to justice, and effective parliaments, with Africa and Europe accounting for the largest share of this decline. Notably, press freedom experienced its biggest fall in 50 years, declining in 43 countries due to government interventions, pandemic legacies, and disinformation. The report also highlights a concerning erosion of democratic norms in the United States, which could have global repercussions.</p>

          <p>A Redfin report suggests San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal" levels, specifically to July 2018 mortgage payment-to-income ratios, due to slowing home-price growth and falling mortgage rates. This doesn't imply affordability, but rather a pre-pandemic equilibrium for tech workers with high salaries. While the typical US household spent 30% of income on mortgages in 2018, San Francisco residents spent 74%. The report's projections are not certain, and the AI boom continues to spike rents, crowding out lower-wage tenants. The housing market remains challenging for many, despite this statistical normalization.</p>

          <p>The murder of Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, is described as a tragedy for his family and a disaster for the country, intensifying an atmosphere of national paranoia and hatred. The article positions Kirk as a charismatic provocateur in the vein of Huey Long and Malcolm X, cut down while exercising his freedom of speech. His death on a college campus, under a 'Prove Me Wrong' tent, underscores the perilous state of American political discourse. The author cautions against using this event as a pretext for political repression, emphasizing that violence is violence, regardless of one's agreement with Kirk's views.</p>

          <p>A massive manhunt is intensifying for the suspect who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, with heavily armed police searching door-to-door on the locked-down campus. Officials confirmed two initial detainees were released, and the incident is believed to be a "targeted attack" from a nearby rooftop. Concerns have been raised about the event's security, as only six university officers were present for a crowd of 3,000. President Trump and Utah Governor Spencer Cox condemned the killing, calling it a "political assassination" and blaming "radical left political violence," while vowing to find those responsible.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama announced that Ghana has agreed to accept West African nationals deported from the United States, with the first group of 14, including Nigerians and a Gambian, already having arrived. This agreement is part of President Trump's broader strategy to curb immigration through high-profile raids and deportations, with other African nations like Rwanda and Eswatini also accepting deportees. The deal comes amidst heightened US tariffs on Ghanaian goods and visa restrictions, though Mahama maintained that relations between Accra and Washington remain positive.

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may contain the strongest hints yet of ancient microscopic life. Scientists emphasized that definitive conclusions require in-depth analysis of these samples back on Earth. The rover collected its 25th sample from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a channel that once fed Jezero Crater. Along with organic carbon, researchers found minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, compounds often produced by microorganisms on Earth. While non-biological processes could also be responsible, this discovery marks a compelling step in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order that blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, continuing a legal battle over her removal. US District Court Judge Jia Cobb had ruled that the public interest in Fed independence favored Cook's reinstatement, citing her strong showing that Trump's purported removal violated the Federal Reserve Act's "cause" requirement. Trump claimed Cook was being fired over mortgage fraud allegations, which she denies, with her attorneys arguing it's a pretext for pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates. The Senate Banking Committee recently advanced Trump's nominee for another Fed seat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk marks a critical point in the surge of US political violence, with experts warning of an escalating "vicious spiral" that could lead to widespread civil unrest. Mike Jensen of the University of Maryland notes a near doubling of politically-motivated attacks this year compared to last, driven by economic insecurity, demographic anxieties, and inflammatory political discourse. This incident, following other high-profile attacks, highlights how traditional ideological divides have morphed into deep personal animosity, amplified by social media.

          <p>Senior cancer doctors in England are warning that excessive bureaucracy is creating a "postcode lottery" for patients trying to access the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) states that cumbersome funding application processes stifle innovation, making cutting-edge treatments like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) more readily available in larger, better-funded units. This inequitable situation means some patients miss out on life-saving advances, despite a "golden age" of cancer treatment. The government is expected to release a new cancer strategy later this year, aiming to put the NHS at the forefront of global cancer care.</p>
