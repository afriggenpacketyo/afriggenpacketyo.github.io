          <p>The United Kingdom's new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has announced that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to return their own citizens who are failed asylum seekers. This statement came during a Five Eyes intelligence group meeting in London, where she emphasized that securing UK borders is her top priority. The potential policy is part of a broader strategy to address the rising number of small boat crossings in the Channel, which has surpassed 30,000 this year. The government is exploring more coordinated actions with allies like the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to pressure uncooperative nations.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision, dismissing Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he was protected by presidential immunity. The panel of judges stated that Trump failed to provide any new grounds that would warrant reconsidering their previous ruling on the immunity issue. The court also found that the trial was conducted fairly and that the damages awarded by the jury were reasonable given the circumstances of the case.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the various economic forces that determine the daily price of gold, which is identified as a key safe-haven asset for investors. The value of the precious metal is primarily influenced by the core principles of supply and demand, broader global economic conditions, and inflation rates, with its price often increasing during periods of financial instability. Other significant drivers include prevailing interest rates, geopolitical tensions, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the buying or selling policies of central banks that maintain large gold reserves. Market sentiment and speculative activities also contribute to short-term price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between protesters and security forces in Nepal have resulted in at least 19 deaths and dozens of injuries following widespread demonstrations against a government-imposed social media ban. Thousands gathered in Kathmandu to protest the decision to block platforms like Facebook and X, which the government claims is necessary to combat misinformation and online fraud. However, demonstrators see the ban as an authoritarian measure and have also used the protests to voice broader dissatisfaction with government corruption and economic failures. In response to the escalating unrest, authorities have imposed a curfew in certain areas of the capital.</p>

This information was shared on a CCTV program that highlighted the technological advancements of the new fighter, which was recently featured in a major military parade. The missile capacity matches that of the United States' F-22 Raptor, indicating a significant step forward in China's aerial combat capabilities.

          <p>The article highlights the severe health crises facing unvaccinated children, particularly in conflict-ridden nations like Sudan, where civil war has decimated the healthcare system. Experts explain that without immunizations, children are highly vulnerable to preventable but deadly diseases such as pneumonia, rotavirus, and measles, which are exacerbated by malnutrition and poor sanitation in crowded living conditions. The piece details the physiological progression of these illnesses, which can lead to rapid deterioration, permanent disabilities like hearing loss, or death. It underscores that for millions of families in war zones, the lack of vaccinations is not a choice but a consequence of collapsed infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated a legal battle over congressionally approved funds by asking the Supreme Court to allow it to freeze over $4 billion in foreign aid. The request for emergency relief follows a lower court's ruling that mandated the executive branch to spend the money as appropriated by the end of the fiscal year. The administration argues that the lower court's injunction infringes on presidential authority and creates a threat to the separation of powers. This dispute centers on the president's use of a rare maneuver to rescind funds that have already been allocated by Congress for foreign assistance programs.</p>

          <p>A man fishing with his grandson in Aripeka, Florida, has discovered the remains of a wooden vessel that he believes could be a 19th-century ship. The wreckage, consisting of visible wooden beams and planks, was uncovered in mud flats during low tide. The discoverer, Thomas Peterson, speculates it might have been a rum-runner ship used for smuggling liquor, possibly even predating the Prohibition era. Local archaeologists are now investigating the site to determine the origin and historical significance of the find, which will subsequently be managed by the state of Florida under its historical protection statutes.</p>

          <p>Lamar Jackson, the quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, has expressed regret for shoving a fan during a game against the Buffalo Bills. The incident occurred after a fan slapped Jackson and a teammate on their helmets while they were celebrating a touchdown near the stands. Jackson admitted that he let his emotions get the better of him and should have allowed security to handle the situation, as the fan was subsequently ejected from the stadium. Despite the confrontation, the two-time NFL MVP stated that he enjoys interacting with fans and does not plan to stop celebrating with them in the future.</p>

          <p>According to a report from the Farikhtegan newspaper, the Iranian government has decided to resume nuclear negotiations with the United States for the first time since the recent war with Israel. While there has been no official confirmation, the decision was reportedly made on Sunday. The initial focus of the talks would be to request a postponement of the 'snapback' mechanism, which was initiated by European nations to reimpose United Nations sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. The West has long accused Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons, a claim Tehran denies, and previous negotiations before the conflict ended without a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Monday, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both showing gains as investors closely watch the political situation in France. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is facing a confidence vote that he is widely expected to lose, following disagreements over proposed budget cuts amounting to around 44 billion euros. A defeat for Bayrou would compel President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years, adding to political uncertainty. The market's positive start is also influenced by hopes for an interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve following weaker-than-expected jobs data. (not investment advice)</p>

The mural's appearance follows a recent protest where nearly 900 people were arrested, though it does not reference a specific cause.

The race requires candidates to secure the backing of at least 80 MPs to stand. Harman emphasized the need for a deputy who can broaden the leader's reach and galvanize the party, rather than acting as a counterpoint to Sir Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about artificial intelligence causing job losses, labor economists suggest its overall impact on the workforce has been relatively small so far. According to experts, the recent slowdown in the job market is more attributable to general economic uncertainty than to the widespread adoption of AI technologies. While some AI-driven layoffs have occurred, they have been largely concentrated within the tech industry, which constitutes a small fraction of the total U.S. workforce. The article notes that a broader threat would only emerge if AI begins to significantly affect other major sectors, and currently, there is growing demand for workers with AI-related skills.</p>

They also express skepticism about the firm's commitment to Minnesota's clean energy transition, despite promises to invest in renewables.

          <h2>Proposed Russia-to-China Gas Pipeline Could Disrupt Global LNG Markets, Analysts Say</h2>

          <p>The long-discussed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline from Russia to China could cause a "structural shock" to the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market if it becomes operational. Analysts suggest the pipeline would provide China with a cheaper and more secure energy supply, allowing it to bypass maritime chokepoints and insulate itself from volatile global prices. This could present significant strategic and market challenges for the United States, the current top LNG exporter. Although talks for the multi-billion dollar project have been revived since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, unresolved issues over pricing and routing may still lead to protracted negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has confirmed that the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) will open on its traditional October 1 date for the 2026-27 academic year, following two years of delays. Students seeking federal aid will need to be aware of significant changes, including new lifetime borrowing limits and the elimination of Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans for new borrowers starting July 1, 2026. The legislation also places new caps on how much parents can borrow for an undergraduate's education. Despite the upheaval, financial experts continue to advise all students pursuing higher education to submit the FAFSA to determine their eligibility for grants and loans.</p>

          <p>Arundhati Roy's new memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," chronicles her journey from the international literary fame she achieved with her debut novel, "The God of Small Things," to her subsequent life as a prominent and often controversial political writer. The book details how she fled the "gilded cage" of literary celebrity to focus on critical essays about social injustice, caste, and religious violence in India. Roy describes this shift as a liberation that allowed her to become a "seditious traitor-writer," actively challenging the rising tide of Hindu nationalism and the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has led to legal action against her.</p>

          <p>Less than two months after CBS announced its cancellation, "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" won its first-ever Emmy award for outstanding directing for a variety series. The win at the Creative Arts Emmys is a significant, albeit bittersweet, milestone for the show, which is scheduled to end its run in May 2026. The cancellation decision was made amid a controversial $16 million settlement CBS paid to Donald Trump and was officially attributed to the declining advertising market for late-night television. Many industry insiders view the Emmy victory as a symbolic show of support for the program in the wake of the public and industry consternation over its cancellation.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed background on Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, set to be commissioned on September 9. The $5 billion dam was financed primarily through domestic bonds and public donations after international lenders withheld funding due to its geopolitical sensitivity. The project has been a source of significant tension with downstream nations Egypt and Sudan, who fear it will drastically reduce their water supplies from the Nile River. Despite years of failed negotiations, Ethiopia maintains the dam is a shared opportunity for regional development and has proceeded with its operation without a formal water-sharing agreement.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after the medals distributed to approximately 60,000 participants mistakenly featured an aerial view of the city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The half-marathon route runs through Newcastle, Gateshead, and South Shields along the River Tyne, making the error particularly notable given the historic rivalry between Newcastle and Sunderland. In a humorous statement, the Great Run Company admitted the mistake, calling the items "the most unique T-shirt and medal in Great North Run history." The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, acknowledged that he also failed to spot the geographical error despite close inspection.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is set to significantly increase its spending in Latin America and the Caribbean by over NT$1 billion (US$32.8 million) in the next fiscal year. This budget increase is a strategic move to strengthen relationships with its few remaining diplomatic allies in the region. The funding aims to counter Beijing's intensified campaign to persuade these nations to switch their official recognition to mainland China. The plan includes allocating more funds for bilateral cooperation and public diplomacy, such as inviting a larger number of influential guests from the region to Taiwan to foster better understanding and promote a positive image.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a woman recounts her seven-year struggle with debilitating pain from perimenopause and endometriosis, which was repeatedly dismissed by her male OB-GYN with comments like "periods hurt." After years of being unheard and undertreated, she sought a second opinion from a female doctor who immediately identified serious issues and validated her suffering. The author's experience highlights the well-documented "gender pain gap," where women's health concerns are often taken less seriously than men's. Ultimately, she underwent a hysterectomy, which resolved her pain and dramatically improved her quality of life, underscoring the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that if the Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump's tariff plan, the Treasury Department would be forced to issue massive refunds to businesses that paid the duties. Bessent expressed confidence that the administration's tariff authority would be upheld but acknowledged the significant financial implications of an adverse ruling, potentially amounting to half of the tariffs collected. The administration has requested an expedited decision from the court after a federal appeals court found that Trump had overstepped his presidential authority in implementing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on imported goods from most countries.
