          <p>North Korea has officially declared its nuclear weapons status "irreversible," rejecting international calls for denuclearization and asserting its right to nuclear development as an internal affair. This defiant stance emerges as the United States, South Korea, and Japan commence "Freedom Edge 25," a joint military exercise off Jeju Island, which Pyongyang condemns as a significant threat to its security and regional stability. North Korean officials accused the U.S. of violating its own non-proliferation obligations while simultaneously expanding its nuclear capabilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency continues to view North Korea's nuclear programs as clear violations of UN resolutions, underscoring persistent international concern over the secretive state's actions.</p>

          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has determined that American chip giant Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly law. This finding stems from a probe initiated last December concerning Nvidia's 2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, which was initially approved with stipulations. SAMR's earlier approval required Nvidia to continue supplying its GPU accelerators and Mellanox's high-speed network equipment to the Chinese market under fair and non-discriminatory principles. This development signals an apparent escalation in the ongoing technology rivalry between China and the United States, with further investigation expected to follow.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched a year-long anti-dumping probe targeting general-purpose interface and gate driver chips from the United States, specifically those built using 40nm and above process nodes. These "legacy chips" are crucial for cost-sensitive applications like smart home appliances and industrial motor drives. Major US chipmakers, including Texas Instruments and Broadcom, are expected to be impacted by this investigation. The probe was prompted by a request from the Jiangsu Provincial Semiconductor Industry Association, which reported a continuous and significant decline in prices for these US-origin products throughout 2024, indicating potential unfair competition.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister, is facing increasing pressure and criticism from within the Labour party following his handling of the dismissal of US ambassador Peter Mandelson. Mandelson was sacked last week after emails surfaced showing supportive messages he sent following convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein's guilty plea. This scandal, coupled with Angela Rayner's recent resignation, has intensified concerns among Labour MPs regarding Starmer's judgment and the Downing Street operation. With upcoming elections and a state visit from President Trump, the party is struggling with a bleak mood and fears of further electoral setbacks, leading to questions about the Prime Minister's future.</p>

          <p>Following Swedish payments group Klarna's successful $17 billion initial public offering, the fintech industry is keenly watching for the next major company to go public. Klarna's positive market reception, alongside other recent fintech listings like eToro and Gemini, signals a more welcoming environment on Wall Street for such debuts. Companies like Stripe, Revolut, Monzo, Starling Bank, and Payhawk are identified as strong contenders, each having achieved significant private valuations or demonstrating strong growth. While some have opted for secondary share sales recently, the success of Klarna's IPO provides a positive indicator for future listings in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fourteen NHS trusts in England are set to undergo investigations into their maternity services due to widespread "failures in the system." This rapid review, announced in June and chaired by Baroness Amos, aims to address issues spanning over 15 years, with bereaved families expressing strong criticism over the review's scope and the Health Secretary's handling. Concerns include ignored patient voices, poor leadership, and a toxic culture preventing learning from safety incidents, with disproportionately poorer outcomes for Black and Asian families. The review, now extended to Spring 2026, seeks to rebuild a world-class maternity system amidst a crisis highlighted by recent reports of preventable baby deaths and unsatisfactory facilities.</p>

With over 1.19 terawatts of coal capacity and approximately 100 gigawatts expected to retire by 2030, this conversion could offer a direct and efficient path to reducing carbon emissions.

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo have been marred by significant injuries, with British pole vaulter Molly Caudery's gold medal bid ending prematurely after she rolled her ankle during warm-up. Visibly emotional, the 2024 world indoor champion was forced to withdraw before competition began, experiencing a devastating repeat of her Olympic final disappointment. Further heartbreak struck Sarah Tait, who fell during her 3,000m steeplechase heat, and Emile Cairess, a marathon medal contender, who pulled out due to the brutal 30C heat and humidity. These incidents highlight the immense physical and emotional toll on athletes competing at the highest level.</p>

          <p>China's economic slowdown intensified in August, with retail sales, industrial output, and fixed-asset investment all missing analysts' expectations. Retail sales growth slowed to 3.4% year-on-year, while industrial output saw its weakest level since August 2024. Real estate investment continued its contraction, slumping 12.9% in the first eight months, indicating persistent weak domestic demand. The urban unemployment rate also edged higher, attributed to the graduation season. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged "unstable and uncertain factors" in the external environment, stressing the need for macro policies to stabilize employment, businesses, and market expectations amidst ongoing challenges.

This incident has strained ties between the two countries, with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung warning it could deter foreign investment into the US.

Despite significant investment in new signings and Amorim's adherence to a 3-4-3 system, United's problems persist, including a humiliating Carabao Cup exit and their poorest league start since 1992-93.

          <p>Nesrine Malik's article argues that President Trump's capricious foreign policy is driving a global realignment, characterized by the alienation of traditional US allies such as Qatar and India. Recent events, including an Israeli strike in Doha and Trump's imposition of tariffs on India, are pushing these nations to explore new regional alliances and expressions of solidarity. The piece suggests that while these responses may partly be for show, they also represent genuine attempts to diversify power blocs and reduce overexposure to Trump's unpredictable regime. This perceived unreliability, combined with Israel's actions, is breaking the existing status quo and fostering an unsettling, chaotic shift in international relations.</p>

Vikings rookie quarterback J.J.

Falcons running back Bijan Robinson was a standout, rushing for 143 yards on 22 carries, while kicker Parker Romo successfully converted all five of his field goal attempts.

          <p>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the de facto US embassy, has stated that China is intentionally mischaracterizing World War Two-era documents to pressure and isolate Taiwan.

Taiwan's government maintains that the People's Republic of China, which did not exist then, has no right to claim Taiwan. This statement reinforces the US "one China policy," which acknowledges China's position but takes no official stance on Taiwan's sovereignty, further escalating the diplomatic dispute.</p>
