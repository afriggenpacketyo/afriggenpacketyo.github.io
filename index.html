          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 08:50:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UnitedHealth Group has revised its 2025 earnings outlook downward, falling short of Wall Street expectations due to persistently high medical costs. The company anticipates adjusted earnings of at least $16 per share, significantly lower than the previously projected $20.91, causing its stock to drop. Insurers are facing increased expenses as more seniors undergo procedures delayed during the pandemic, particularly in Medicare Advantage plans. UnitedHealth's new CEO, Stephen Hemsley, acknowledged operational mistakes and announced that independent experts would review the company's processes to restore investor confidence.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk experienced a significant stock price drop of over 20% after cutting its full-year financial guidance and announcing a leadership change. The company lowered its sales growth forecast, attributing the revision to weaker-than-expected U.S. sales of its popular Wegovy obesity drug and Ozempic diabetes treatment. Factors cited include competition from compounded drugs and a slower market expansion. Company veteran Maziar Mike Doustdar has been appointed as the new president and CEO to navigate the company through its next phase amid these market challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that the gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building was targeting the National Football League's offices. The shooter, identified as Shane Tamura from Las Vegas, left a note indicating he believed he had CTE, a brain injury associated with contact sports, and blamed the NFL. Tamura took the wrong elevator, opening fire at Rudin Management instead, where he killed three victims and NYPD Officer Didarul Islam before taking his own life. Investigators found he had a documented mental health history and was heavily armed.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of economists, fund managers, and strategists indicates a tight race for the next Federal Reserve chair, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as the leading contenders. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett follows closely behind as a potential replacement for current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Despite President Trump's past criticisms, 84% of respondents believe he will not fire Powell before his term concludes. The survey also reflects concerns that political pressure could make the Fed less likely to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite widespread warnings, the full impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices has not yet materialized due to several strategic factors. The administration has repeatedly delayed the implementation of the highest tariffs, giving importers a window to act. In anticipation, many companies stockpiled goods, rushing shipments from overseas to build up inventory before the new import taxes took effect. Additionally, some importers are holding back shipments or absorbing the initial cost increases to avoid alienating inflation-weary shoppers. However, experts warn that these are temporary measures, and price hikes are still expected as stockpiles dwindle and storage costs rise. (not investment advice)</p>

These challenging encounters have left EU bureaucrats heading into their August break with few victories and growing concerns about the bloc's ability to assert its interests on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Meta's significant investments and strategic shifts in artificial intelligence are a key focus for Wall Street ahead of its second-quarter earnings report. The company has been on an aggressive hiring spree, bringing in top talent from competitors like OpenAI and Google to lead a new AI unit after its Llama 4 model received a lukewarm reception from developers. This overhaul, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, involves billions in spending to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape. Investors will be looking for justification of these costs and clarity on whether Meta will continue its open-source AI strategy or shift toward proprietary models.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is intensifying efforts to establish a domestic supply chain for rare earth elements to reduce its heavy reliance on China, which currently dominates the global market. These 17 elements are critical for manufacturing everything from electric vehicles to defense equipment, making them a powerful bargaining chip in the ongoing trade war. In response to China's export controls, the U.S. Department of Defense and private investors are funding American companies like MP Materials to expand domestic mining and processing capabilities. The goal is to create a secure, independent supply of these vital materials for key industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to long-held pessimistic views, the institution of marriage in the United States is showing signs of a comeback, according to a new analysis. The divorce rate has fallen by nearly 40% since its peak in the early 1980s, and the share of children living in stable, two-parent married families has started to increase for the first time in decades. This trend is observed even among working-class and Black Americans. The article suggests this resilience is due to marriage adapting to modern expectations, such as more equitable sharing of household and childcare duties, challenging negative narratives from both the left and right.</p>

The procession is scheduled to travel along Broad Street, pausing at the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, a site that has become a memorial with thousands of fan tributes. The public event, funded by the Osbourne family, will take place ahead of a private funeral. Birmingham's Lord Mayor described the late Black Sabbath singer, who died at 76, as a "son of Birmingham" who put the city on the global map.</p>

The talks, held at Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort, covered the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the impact of U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky. Swinney advocated for an exemption for the spirit, a critical Scottish export, highlighting its unique geographical origin. He also urged the president to use his influence to push for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza.

          <p>The de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jetliner, marked the dawn of the jet age in 1952 but its reign was cut short by a series of catastrophic failures. Offering unprecedented speed and comfort, the Comet was a symbol of luxury travel before design flaws in its fuselage led to fatal mid-air breakups. A museum in the UK has now painstakingly restored the fuselage of one of these pioneering aircraft, offering a unique glimpse into early jet travel. The restoration honors the Comet's legacy as an innovation that, through its tragic mistakes, ultimately paved the way for safer modern aviation.</p>

          <p>UK Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has sparked a political firestorm by suggesting that Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is "on the side" of sex offenders like Jimmy Savile for opposing the new Online Safety Act.

The controversy highlights the intense debate over the new legislation, which imposes strict requirements on tech firms to prevent children from accessing harmful content, and the divisive political rhetoric surrounding issues of free speech and online safety.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading international authority, has issued a stark alert stating that the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip." While short of a formal declaration, the report warns of widespread death without immediate, unimpeded humanitarian access. After nearly 22 months of war and blockades, mounting evidence shows that starvation, malnutrition, and disease are causing a rise in hunger-related deaths, particularly among children. Aid organizations say recent measures like airdrops are insufficient to address the catastrophic levels of suffering and food deprivation faced by Gaza's population.</p>

The truce was mediated by Malaysia, the current chair of ASEAN, but was reportedly violated by small-arms fire just hours after taking effect. Analysts suggest the ceasefire may hold, as both nations have achieved certain political objectives and face external pressure, including tariff threats from the U.S. However, the lack of a third-party monitoring agreement raises concerns about the long-term enforcement and stability of the peace deal.</p>

          <p>Workers and union leaders at industrial plants in Michigan and Kentucky report that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration is causing significant labor shortages. The termination of programs like the CHNV Parole Program has led to the abrupt dismissal of veteran immigrant workers, creating chaos on assembly lines and forcing remaining employees to work mandatory overtime. At a GE Appliances plant, the loss of over 125 workers reportedly disrupted production. Economists warn that mass deportations could have severe consequences for the U.S. economy, impacting industries from construction to hospitality that rely heavily on immigrant labor.</p>
