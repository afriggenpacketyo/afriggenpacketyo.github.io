        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spirit Airlines is preparing for more significant operational changes as it navigates severe financial difficulties. CEO Dave Davis announced that the airline will reduce its flight capacity by 25% in November to cut costs, focusing on its most profitable markets. This move comes shortly after the company's second bankruptcy filing in under a year and follows previous furloughs of pilots and flight attendants. Davis warned employees to brace for more job cuts as the carrier negotiates with vendors and evaluates its fleet size to create a smaller, more sustainable business model.</p>

          <p>ABC has indefinitely taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air following controversial remarks the host made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after major broadcast station owners, including Nexstar and Sinclair, announced they would stop airing the show, calling Kimmel's comments insensitive and not in the public interest. In his monologue, Kimmel criticized what he described as attempts by the "MAGA gang" to politicize the killing. The move has drawn praise from figures like President Trump and the FCC Chairman, escalating the debate over speech and accountability in media.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), will adopt a cautious approach to monetary easing. The PBOC is expected to implement only moderate rate cuts this year, which would help narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries and reduce capital outflow pressures on the Chinese yuan. This strategy is aimed at providing targeted support to the economy while maintaining currency stability. Experts suggest this measured response will help bolster the yuan's value against the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo spacecraft is set to arrive at the International Space Station after its initial approach was aborted due to premature engine shutdowns. NASA confirmed that the issue was traced to overly conservative software settings in an early warning system, and the spacecraft is now operating as intended. Astronauts Jonny Kim and Zena Cardman will use the station's robotic arm to capture the vessel, which is carrying over 11,000 pounds of vital supplies, research materials, and spare parts. The successful resolution of the problem allows the critical resupply mission to proceed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his plan to designate the decentralized, far-left movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The announcement raises legal and practical questions, as antifa is an umbrella term for various militant groups and lacks a formal, hierarchical structure, making it difficult to label under existing anti-terror laws. The U.S. currently has a list for foreign terrorist organizations but no domestic equivalent, partly due to First Amendment protections. This move follows previous statements by Trump and comes amid heightened political tensions and debates over domestic extremism.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident, to either Algeria or Syria. The ruling states that Khalil deliberately omitted information on his U.S. green card application, specifically his internship with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and his ties to an anti-Israel campus group. Federal authorities argued these omissions posed national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team intends to appeal the decision, arguing that the government's actions are retaliation for his protected political speech and activism.</p>

          <p>The man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, surrendered peacefully after expressing intense fear of being shot by law enforcement. Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby explained that Robinson's family, aided by a trusted retired detective, negotiated the surrender to avoid a heavily armed SWAT raid on their home. Robinson knew his capture was inevitable after his image was circulated in the media. The sheriff credited the use of community ties for defusing a potentially violent confrontation and ensuring the suspect was taken into custody without incident.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists measured the ethanol content in figs and plum-like fruits favored by the primates, confirming a steady, low-dose exposure to alcohol. This finding lends direct chemical evidence to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which posits that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors. The study suggests the chimps are not getting drunk but are consistently consuming the boozy snacks.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has strongly recommended against scrapping the individual care plans, known as EHCPs, for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). Instead of eliminating the legally binding documents, the committee called for the government to establish new national minimum standards for Send support in all schools. The report also advocates for increased funding and more comprehensive training for all teachers to better support students with diverse needs, ensuring a more inclusive and well-resourced mainstream education system for every child.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the California Budget and Policy Center, California is tied with Louisiana for the highest poverty rate in the United States, at 17.7%. The study reveals that poverty surged after pandemic-era aid programs expired and has shown little improvement since, with about 7 million residents unable to afford basic necessities. Children and people of color are among the most affected demographics, with child poverty having more than doubled since 2021. The report's authors argue that poverty is a policy choice and call for state leaders to take bold action to counteract federal budget cuts.</p>

He claimed the campaign has resulted in over 100 firings, which supporters refer to as collecting "scalps."

Newsom's team labeled the assertion a "straight up lie," clarifying that an executive order actually gives local governments, like Los Angeles, the authority to ban or limit such housing projects in areas affected by recent firestorms. The city's mayor had subsequently banned new duplex applications in the burn zone, directly contradicting Trump's statement and highlighting the ongoing political friction between the two leaders.</p>
