          <h2>Former President Trump Criticizes U.S. Cattle Ranchers Over Beef Prices and Tariff Understanding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 13:45:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump asserted that U.S. cattle ranchers do not fully grasp the benefits of his tariff policies, suggesting they are the sole reason for their recent financial success. He urged them to lower their prices for consumers, a statement that followed his proposal to import beef from Argentina to reduce domestic costs. This proposal has drawn criticism from ranching organizations like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which argues that such government intervention harms American producers and disrupts the free market without lowering grocery store prices. The conflict highlights a rift between Trump and a typically supportive constituency over agricultural and trade policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a strike on a suspected drug boat in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of two individuals on board. This marks the eighth such operation against alleged narco-traffickers since early September, though it is the first to occur outside the Caribbean. The Trump administration has defended these actions as necessary in a "non-international armed conflict" against drug organizations, which it equates to terrorist groups. The policy has led to at least 36 fatalities and has raised tensions with Latin American governments, including Colombia, as the U.S. expands its aggressive counter-narcotics strategy into major trafficking routes.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old Queens woman, Assa Diawara, has been charged with child abandonment and endangerment after allegedly leaving her newborn baby at a Manhattan subway station. The infant girl was discovered alive and conscious on a stairway at the 34th Street–Penn Station stop, wrapped in a blanket with her umbilical cord still attached. After police released surveillance footage, Diawara was identified and arrested. The baby was transported to a local hospital for care. Officials have reminded the public that New York's Safe Haven Law permits the safe and legal surrender of newborns at designated locations like hospitals or police stations without criminal penalty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet has found that different antidepressants produce widely varying physiological side effects, including significant changes in weight, heart rate, and blood pressure. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and found, for example, that some drugs were associated with an average weight gain of four pounds, while others led to an average loss of five and a half pounds. The study's authors emphasize that these medications remain effective and life-saving treatments for depression and anxiety. They recommend that doctors use this information to better tailor prescriptions to individual patient health profiles and carefully monitor for potential side effects.</p>

          <p>The UK government has postponed its planned reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) system in England until 2026, delaying the publication of its Schools White Paper. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the delay allows for a period of "co-creation" to test proposals with families and experts. The decision has been met with mixed reactions; while some welcome the additional time for consultation, others, like the County Councils Network, called it "massively disappointing," warning of a deepening crisis. The current SEND system has been described as financially unsustainable and failing to provide adequate support for children, leaving local authorities facing significant budget deficits.</p>

          <p>Seventy years after her execution, the grandchildren of Ruth Ellis are formally requesting a posthumous pardon, arguing she was a victim of severe domestic abuse. Ellis was hanged in 1955 for murdering her partner, David Blakely, following what her family's lawyers describe as long-standing physical, sexual, and emotional violence, including a miscarriage-inducing assault. Her lawyers contend that with modern understanding of domestic abuse and battered woman syndrome, her charge would likely have been manslaughter, not murder. The case was highly influential in shifting public opinion against the death penalty, which was abolished for murder in the UK in 1969.</p>

This incident highlights potential flaws in the deterrence scheme, which is designed to discourage Channel crossings by returning some migrants in exchange for accepting recognized refugees from France.

The proposed change would impose a new charge on these individuals, aiming to make the tax system fairer and raise revenue to meet fiscal targets. While think tanks support leveling the tax treatment between different work structures, some groups, like the British Medical Association, warn it could harm the financial viability of smaller, doctor-led private practices.

          <p>Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maine, has apologized for and covered up a chest tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol after it caused a public backlash. The tattoo, a skull-and-crossbones image similar to the Nazi Totenkopf, became visible in a social media video. Platner, a Marine veteran, stated he got the tattoo in 2007 with fellow Marines while drinking and was unaware of its hateful connotations, expressing disgust at any insinuation he knew its meaning. The controversy adds to recent scrutiny of his past online remarks, for which he has also apologized, citing his struggles with depression after returning from war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend is emerging in the tech industry where large companies like Meta and HP acquire or invest in promising AI startups, only to follow up with substantial layoffs of the smaller company's staff. This pattern reflects a shift where big tech firms are aggressively streamlining operations and eliminating duplicate roles to satisfy Wall Street, rather than preserving the startup's culture or workforce. For employees at these startups, the once-dream scenario of a lucrative acquisition is increasingly turning into job insecurity. The rapid pace of AI development is also causing companies to flatten their organizational structures, further contributing to workforce volatility.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees within its AI units as part of a broader effort to streamline its structure and increase operational agility. The cuts will affect workers across various teams, including AI infrastructure and fundamental research. This move comes as Meta invests heavily in AI to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google, including a recent $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Despite the layoffs, Meta's overall expenses are projected to rise in the coming years, driven by its long-term AI initiatives, such as the development of a massive new data center in Louisiana.</p>

Despite strong third-quarter results and a 55% increase in power equipment orders, GE Vernova's stock fell as the company did not raise its 2025 forecast. The company is largely sold out of its power generation equipment through 2028, highlighting the critical challenge of energy supply for the AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Taking over a team in the relegation zone, Dyche emphasized the need for "effective football" to stabilize the club's situation in the Premier League. His hiring follows the brief and unsuccessful tenure of Ange Postecoglou, whose expansive, attacking approach failed to yield results. Dyche, known for his pragmatic approach at previous clubs, believes the key is to find a style that works for the current squad and restores a winning mentality, regardless of whether it involves long or short passes.</p>

Analysts explain that these less-established tokens are more volatile, less liquid, and more commonly used for high-leverage trading on offshore exchanges.
