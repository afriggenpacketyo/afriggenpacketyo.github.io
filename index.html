            <p>Natalie Robyn, the former CEO of the FIA, has publicly stated that she faced challenging circumstances during her tenure, working to strengthen governance and operational transparency. Her comments come in response to the resignation of the deputy president of sport, highlighting serious structural challenges within the organization. Robyn's departure, along with those of other senior figures, followed her raising concerns about the FIA's governance and financial practices. These issues threaten the credibility and long-term effectiveness of the global motorsport governing body, which is also facing legal action from Susie Wolff. Optimism surrounding the FIA is low because of the multiple accusations of corruption and lack of transparency.</p>

While initial versions were criticized for inaccuracies, updated versions are now more restrained, offering generalized information and referring users to human agents for complex questions. These chatbots serve as coaches, providing confidence in accuracy rather than replacing human accountants, and saving users time. Though accuracy is guaranteed by both companies, users are warned to review all answers provided by the AI due to the potential for errors, while AI is being used to automate and streamline tax-filing processes, saving accountants time. </p>

Jassy also emphasizes the need for Amazon to maintain a startup-like culture, eliminate bureaucracy, and prioritize customer-centric innovation in this rapidly evolving technological landscape.

            <p>President Trump has imposed 125% tariffs on goods imported from China, leading Beijing to respond with an 84% tax on American products, while suspending tariffs for 90 days on other countries. He argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but the world economy has been thrown into chaos and prices are expected to rise for consumers. Economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs, causing significant volatility on global stock markets. The UK is already due to be affected by the earlier tariffs targeting steel, aluminium and car imports.</p>

            <p>Barclays has become the largest UK lender to lower mortgage rates, with certain fixed-term deals now at 3.99%, driven by uncertainty caused by US tariff policy raising expectations of interest rate cuts. This move aligns with other lenders reducing rates this week, as concerns about tariffs potentially causing an economic slowdown lead analysts to predict the Bank of England will reduce borrowing costs. The fixed rates below 4% are available to borrowers with a 60% loan-to-value and an £899 fee applies. According to Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate ticked down on Thursday from 5.3% to 5.29%.</p>

            <p>Investors who acted on President Trump's suggestion to buy stocks on Wednesday morning saw significant gains after he rolled back some of his market-disrupting tariffs. Trump's post on Truth Social stating "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!" led to substantial returns for those who bought into the market, with stocks like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, Trump Media & Technology, and Tesla experiencing notable surges. The SPY finished the session higher by 10.5%, which was its biggest one-day gain since 2008. These gains occurred after Trump announced a walkback on some tariffs, a stark turn after the unveiling of his plan to tax imports last week torpedoed the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed bill would issue a notice upon an unprovoked shark attack in the vicinity.

            <p>Donald Trump backed down on some of his largest tariffs Wednesday afternoon, though the trade war is far from over and the US is still imposing major levies on Chinese goods and a 10% tariff on the vast majority of its other imports. Economists anticipate price increases across various imported goods, from produce to electronics, as businesses pass on costs to consumers. Some businesses have prepared for the tariffs by boosting their inventories, which could help them keep prices stable for a few weeks or months. The Yale Budget Lab estimated that textile imports will be hit particularly hard, making apparel prices rise 33% and non-apparel textiles rise 18%.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele's crackdown on gangs has dramatically reduced violence, but critics argue it comes at the cost of due process and human rights. Bukele's "state of exception" has led to the imprisonment of over 100,000 Salvadorans, some of whom are innocent, and hundreds have died in custody. Despite this, Bukele remains popular, and his policies have been praised by politicians in other countries, including Donald Trump. The state of exception has allowed the police to feel that the government had their backs.</p>

            <p>A spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry stated that Beijing hoped the U.S. would work to de-escalate the trade war after President Trump announced a pause on higher tariffs for many countries. While leaving the door open for dialogue, China emphasized that discussions must be conducted on an equal basis with mutual respect. China's foreign ministry took a harsher stance, and vowed to fight on, and The EU announced its own 90-day pause on any retaliatory tariffs. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he believed he could come to a resolution with China.</p>

Karelina had been serving a 12-year sentence for allegedly donating to a Ukrainian charity and posting anti-war messages, with the exchange negotiated by U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies.</p>

            <p>A High Court judge has ruled that Coleen Rooney's lawyers did not commit misconduct regarding her costs in the "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy. Mrs Vardy sued Mrs Rooney for libel in 2022 but lost. The pair are now locked in a further battle over how much Mrs Vardy should pay in legal costs. Mrs Vardy had alleged that Rooney's legal team understated costs, but the judge dismissed the appeal, finding that the original conclusion was justified. The case stems from Rooney's public accusation that Vardy's Instagram account leaked private information to the press.</p>

            <p>The China Film Administration announced plans to reduce the number of US films shown in the country as retaliation against President Trump's tariffs. The administration stated that tariffs will diminish Chinese audiences' perception of American films, leading to a reduction in import volume. This measure could significantly impact Hollywood studios, as China remains the second-largest cinema market globally. The move follows Trump's tariff increases on Chinese imports, escalating trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's abrupt layoffs of federal personnel and freezing of funds for authorized programs have severely hampered Klamath River basin restoration efforts. This has replaced a budding sense of hopefulness in the basin with fear and uncertainty, and tore at fragile bonds years in the making among upper basin ranchers and farmers, federal, state and local governments, nonprofits and Native tribes. The cuts have halted wetland restoration, fire hardening, and crucial tribal department funding, leading to widespread debt and economic paralysis in the region. The lack of empathy from the administration is starkly evident in the Klamath.</p>

            <p>The bodies of 11 murder victims were found in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero, a region plagued by drug trafficking. The bodies were discovered in the municipality of Tecoanapa, with reports suggesting the killings resulted from clashes between rival organized crime gangs. Guerrero is one of Mexico's most violent states, and the U.S. State Department advises Americans to avoid travel there due to high crime rates. Violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that last year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels.</p>

            <p>Global commodities have slumped more than 20% from the same period last year, according to the S&P GSCI Commodities index. Global commodity prices are getting hammered, as trade war tensions once more fester between the world's two largest economies — and recession signals are flashing red. The S&P GSCI index, which tracks global commodities across the energy, metals and agriculture sectors, shows that prices have declined over 8% since April 2, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a slew of "reciprocal" tariffs. China is the largest consumer of commodities, and the higher-than-expected tariffs are likely to be a drag not only on the country's growth, but also on its consumption of certain commodities, in particular energy and industrial metals.</p>
