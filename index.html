          <p>A gunman opened fire outside the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada, resulting in three deaths and multiple injuries before police shot and apprehended the suspect. The attack occurred at the casino's valet area, and the suspect, who had no known connection to the victims, was heavily armed. Authorities praised the swift response of casino security and police, which they believe prevented the shooter from entering the casino and causing further casualties. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains have caused severe flooding and landslides in and around Beijing, leading to the deaths of at least 34 people and the evacuation of over 80,000 residents. The Miyun district was particularly hard-hit, recording extreme levels of precipitation that prompted authorities to release water from a reservoir for the first time since 1959. The storms have destroyed infrastructure, knocked out power, and caused widespread damage, with residents describing the sudden and rapid rise of floodwaters. Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for extensive rescue efforts as the region braces for more rain.</p>

          <h2>Europe Plans Major Investment in 'Gigawatt' AI Factories to Compete Globally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 01:02:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build a network of "AI gigafactories" in an effort to catch up with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence development. With an initial investment of 10 billion euros for 13 factories and a further 20 billion euros for larger "gigafactories," the plan aims to create ecosystems that combine computing power, data, and talent. These facilities are designed to help thousands of European AI startups overcome the lack of computing capacity, a major obstacle to their growth. While the initiative has drawn significant interest, challenges remain, including securing private investment and addressing the immense power consumption requirements of such large-scale data centers.

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their mission to save lives at sea, regardless of politics, after facing criticism for rescuing migrants in the English Channel. Some have accused the charity of acting as a "taxi service," but the RNLI emphasizes its humanitarian duty to respond to any distress call from the Coastguard. The organization released harrowing footage of a recent rescue to show the dangerous reality of these situations, where crews have saved dozens of lives. Crew members shared emotional accounts of their experiences, reinforcing their commitment to compassion.</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., overtaking China for the first time, according to a report from Canalys. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, while China's share fell to 25%. This significant shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainties. The trend reflects a broader move by global manufacturers to diversify their supply chains, with India emerging as a key hub for electronics assembly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) experienced a more than 8% drop in its share price after announcing a 59% plunge in its first-quarter net profit. The airline attributed the decline to lower interest income and, significantly, losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex restructuring. While operating profit also fell, the company noted that underlying demand for air travel remains strong, though it faces challenges from increased competition and a volatile cargo market. Analysts suggest that Air India will likely continue to be a drag on SIA's bottom line in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, making him the first ex-president in the country's history to be convicted of a crime. The court determined that Uribe conspired to pressure imprisoned former paramilitary members to change their testimony regarding his alleged ties to illegal armed groups. The verdict is the culmination of a case that began in 2012 and has deeply divided the nation, where Uribe is seen by some as a hero and by others as a figure linked to human rights abuses. He faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Facing a demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy program to boost the country's falling birth rate. The policy will offer parents an annual payment of 3,600 yuan (about $500) for each child under the age of three, benefiting an estimated 20 million families. This move follows various local incentives and comes as China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024. High child-rearing costs are a major deterrent for many couples, and this nationwide financial support is part of a broader government effort to address the economic and social challenges of a rapidly aging population.</p>

The decision to restart production, which adds to an existing inventory, suggests a change in strategy for Nvidia, which had previously indicated it might rely on current stockpiles.

          <p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has issued a memo to federal agencies clarifying that public employees are permitted to express their religious beliefs at work, including attempting to persuade colleagues of their views. The guidance states that such expression is protected by the First Amendment and civil rights law, as long as it is polite and ceases if a coworker requests it to stop. The memo, which has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation for potentially encouraging proselytizing, is part of a broader Trump administration push to protect religious expression. It builds on previous policies but has been framed as a new, welcoming approach for Americans of all faiths.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza. The meeting follows Starmer's discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump, where he presented the proposal developed with France and Germany after U.S.-led peace talks stalled. The move comes amid growing domestic pressure on the UK government, with over 140 Labour MPs signing a letter urging the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state. Downing Street has described Palestinian statehood as a matter of "when, not if," and is coordinating with allies to find a path toward a sustainable two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the Trump administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges that Judge Boasberg made improper public comments suggesting the administration would disregard court rulings, thereby undermining judicial integrity. The clash originated from a case where Boasberg blocked deportation flights to a controversial prison in El Salvador, an order the administration allegedly ignored. This rare move by the DOJ seeks an investigation and potential sanctions against the chief judge for the D.C. district court, who has been a vocal critic of the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are facing the loss of critical mental health resources due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of federal grants. The Department of Education suspended the funding, citing concerns that recipients were using it for "race-based actions," a claim disputed by program administrators who say they hired the most qualified candidates. The cuts have left many districts, particularly in rural areas, scrambling to maintain services and staff, such as counselors and social workers. With a nationwide shortage of child mental health professionals, the loss of this funding could create a significant safety and wellness issue for students.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen, Kenny Laynez, has spoken out after video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida drew national attention. In the recording, an officer is heard telling Laynez, "You got no rights here," before he was detained alongside undocumented coworkers. The incident has intensified scrutiny of Florida's crackdown on illegal immigration, which deputizes more local law enforcement for immigration operations. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated the individuals resisted arrest, but advocates argue the case shows how such policies can lead to constitutional violations and the profiling of citizens. Laynez expressed his pain at being denied his rights simply because of his Hispanic appearance.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is drawing mixed reactions, with some economists arguing it is an "asymmetric and unbalanced" pact that will harm the EU's economy. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while American goods will enter the EU tariff-free. In exchange, the EU has pledged to purchase hundreds of billions in U.S. energy and make substantial investments. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturers and farmers, some European industry groups are bracing for a significant financial hit, though they acknowledge the deal avoids the even higher tariffs that were threatened.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with Donald Trump in Scotland provided him with invaluable face time and access to the U.S. president, but it also came with considerable political risks. The trip involved a mix of formal diplomacy and Trump's characteristic free-wheeling style, including an extended, impromptu press conference covering a vast range of topics. For Starmer, navigating these interactions required careful maneuvering to defend his own policies while burnishing a key international relationship. Downing Street views the direct access as crucial for advancing UK interests, particularly on issues like Gaza, where they hope to align with a toughening U.S. outlook.</p>

Wingfield, a transfer who was expected to be a key starter for the Trojans, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive. His collegiate career was disrupted by the pandemic and a season-ending knee injury, factors he and USC believed would merit an extension.
