          <p>Berlin is set to crack down on its long-standing "zu verschenken" or "to gift" tradition, where residents leave unwanted but usable items on the street for others to take. The city's environment department argues that this informal circular economy has led to excessive illegal dumping, costing Berlin over €10 million in cleanup fees last year. To combat this, authorities will introduce significantly higher fines, with penalties ranging from €150 to €15,000 for leaving items like clothes or appliances on the street. While officials point to formal recycling centers as alternatives, sustainability advocates worry the policy may discourage reuse and lead to more usable goods being thrown in the trash.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund improvements. The plan aims to rebuild the utility without requiring taxpayer funding, addressing years of performance issues, including sewage discharges and leaks. Investors have stipulated that the cash injection is contingent on setting achievable performance targets, as they argue the current ones are unrealistic for attracting future investment.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the world's largest storm this year, made landfall in mainland China without causing any fatalities, a stark contrast to previous deadly typhoons in the region. The zero death toll is attributed to extensive preparations, particularly in the tech hub of Shenzhen and throughout Guangdong province. Authorities evacuated over one million people, deployed more than 38,000 rescue personnel, and opened nearly 900 temporary shelters ahead of the storm's arrival. This successful disaster management highlights significant improvements in China's emergency response systems compared to past events, where storms and other natural disasters resulted in numerous deaths.</p>

          <p>China's State Council has issued new guidelines clarifying the standards for products to be considered "Made in China" in government procurement, a move aimed at reassuring foreign companies.

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency after its infant mortality rate reached its highest level in over a decade, with nearly 10 babies dying for every 1,000 live births. The crisis is particularly severe for Black babies, and experts link the issue to a lack of prenatal care, often due to affordability and access challenges in maternity care deserts. Health advocates warn that this situation could worsen nationwide as potential Medicaid cuts threaten to reduce healthcare access for low-income women before and during pregnancy. The article underscores the connection between maternal health, insurance coverage, and infant survival, framing Mississippi's struggles as a potential preview for other states.</p>

          <p>Waking up with a sore back, stiff neck, or achy shoulders can often be attributed to improper sleep posture that creates a lack of support overnight. Medical experts advise maintaining a neutral spine alignment, similar to standing posture, by keeping ears, shoulders, and hips in a straight line. The article provides specific recommendations for back, side, and stomach sleepers, including choosing the right pillow loft and using smaller pillows to fill gaps under the knees or between the legs. While sleeping on one's stomach is generally discouraged due to neck strain, the guidance aims to help individuals in any position minimize muscle tension and improve sleep quality.</p>

While luxury travel remains strong, many middle and lower-income families are scaling back their vacation plans due to tighter budgets for discretionary spending. This economic pressure is leading to a shift in behavior, with more people opting for domestic road trips, choosing destinations closer to home, and shortening the duration of their stays to save money. Consequently, instead of international flights to places like Ireland, families are planning more affordable driving vacations to destinations such as Vermont, reflecting a broader trend of adapting travel to the current economic climate.</p>

In contrast, Stracke described the asset-based financing sector—which includes mortgages and consumer loans—as much healthier due to stronger household balance sheets post-2008. The analysis suggests corporate borrowers face a trade-off between more expensive but flexible private debt and cheaper but more rigid public debt markets. (not investment advice)</p>

This last-minute switch meant that 66 flags flown along The Mall and at Windsor Castle had a different red hue than the accompanying British Union flags.

This drop reinforces concerns about a market slowdown and comes after the company reportedly lowered its annual sales target amid intense domestic price competition. In contrast, several smaller EV startups, including Leapmotor, Xpeng, and Nio, reported record-high monthly deliveries, boosted by new, more affordable models and government incentives. While BYD still commands over half the market share, the diverging results indicate a shifting competitive landscape in China's EV sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming PFL lightweight title rematch between Paul Hughes and champion Usman Nurmagomedov is being hailed as one of the most significant fights in the promotion's history. Their first encounter in January was a dramatic, back-and-forth battle that saw the undefeated Nurmagomedov pushed to his limit before securing a unanimous decision victory. MMA analyst Dan Hardy highlights the Northern Irishman Hughes's remarkable confidence as a key factor that unsettled the champion. For the rematch in Dubai, experts anticipate Nurmagomedov will adopt a more wrestling-heavy strategy, while Hughes will once again need to rise to the occasion to overcome the formidable Dagestani fighter.</p>

At least five students were killed and around 100 were injured in the disaster. After days of searching, rescue teams are now transitioning to using heavy machinery to clear the debris, as thermal drones and listening devices have failed to detect any survivors.</p>

These restaurants are often run by recent immigrants who import specialized chefs and design their spaces to evoke specific cultural eras, creating immersive dining experiences. This culinary expansion reflects a shift in the city's food scene, as Parisians and tourists alike develop a greater appreciation for the diversity and authenticity of Chinese gastronomy.</p>

          <p>As Crystal Palace embarks on its first-ever European campaign, the club faces significant uncertainty regarding the future of its successful manager, Oliver Glasner. The Austrian coach, whose contract expires at the end of the season, has yet to sign a new deal, reportedly due to concerns over the club's commitment to strengthening the squad during the summer transfer window. With key players like captain Marc Guehi also likely to depart, there are growing concerns that Glasner, who has transformed the team's ambitions, may be lured away by a larger club. This precarious situation casts a shadow over a period of unprecedented success for the London-based football club.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's Defence Minister, Martin Pfister, is urging lawmakers to relax the country's strict arms export laws, arguing that the current restrictive stance undermines trust with international security partners. The neutral country has faced criticism for blocking the re-export of Swiss-made weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, a policy the government proposed easing earlier this year. Pfister warned that in an era of growing threats like cyber attacks and drone incursions, Switzerland must be seen as a reliable partner to ensure its own security. He emphasized that stable relationships and the ability to cooperate with other armed forces are crucial for a non-NATO member.</p>

The state prosecutor's office reported that the five individuals were found inside a burned vehicle in the town of Llano Amarillo. Preliminary information suggests the victims had traveled to the community to collect a high-interest loan before they were killed. Such instances of vigilante justice occur periodically in remote parts of Mexico where government presence is limited and public distrust in the legal system is high, reflecting deep-seated issues with impunity.</p>

Imelda is the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and is expected to weaken into an extratropical cyclone. Swells generated by the storm are still likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

After being removed from private land, they moved to an adjacent plot owned by the local council, which then secured a court order for their eviction. The case has drawn further attention due to claims from the Texan woman's mother that her daughter was coerced into joining what she described as a "cult."</p>

While up to $10.3 billion in shares were authorized for the sale, the lower participation is reportedly viewed internally as a sign of confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.

          <p>This article provides context on the recent interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla by explaining the history of such maritime missions to Gaza. Since Israel imposed a naval blockade in 2007, numerous flotillas have attempted to deliver humanitarian aid, with all being thwarted since 2010. The most infamous incident was the 2010 Mavi Marmara raid, where Israeli forces killed ten Turkish activists. These missions aim to draw global attention to the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which activists and human rights groups argue constitutes illegal collective punishment. While the aid delivered is symbolic, organizers say the goal is to challenge the blockade and show solidarity with Palestinians.</p>
