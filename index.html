            <p>An Israeli military investigation has acknowledged "professional failures" in the deaths of 15 Palestinian paramedics in Gaza during March. The investigation found breaches of orders and operational misunderstandings contributed to the incident, which sparked international criticism. While the probe found no evidence of execution, it revealed poor night visibility and misidentification of ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants. A commanding officer will be reprimanded and a deputy commander dismissed as a result, but the report has drawn skepticism from human rights groups who feel the investigation was not comprehensive enough given the severity of the outcome. The incident occurred amidst ongoing conflict and heightened tensions in the region.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump issued two Easter messages, one a traditional greeting and the other a sharply worded attack on "Radical Left Lunatics" and political opponents. Trump accused them of undermining border security and allowing criminals into the country, also criticizing judges and law enforcement officials. He went on to call out "Sleepy Joe Biden," claiming the former president purposefully allowed millions of criminals into the U.S. through "an Open Borders Policy." The messages reflect the ongoing political polarization and Trump's continued focus on immigration and border security as key issues.</p>

            <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleged to be an MS-13 gang member, criticizing Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit to El Salvador to meet with him. Homan argued the administration acted correctly under the Alien Enemies Act, despite concerns about due process. Van Hollen maintains that the case is about upholding the constitutional rights of all individuals, regardless of gang affiliation, saying, "I am not defending the man. I'm defending the rights of this man to due process." The Supreme Court has ordered the man's return to the US be facilitated.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump is reportedly interested in attracting wealthy immigrants to the United States, potentially through the sale of citizenship or residency in exchange for investment. This approach aligns with a broader trend of countries offering "golden visa" schemes. The president and market forces seem to agree on this point, as the current system is seen as cumbersome, underpriced, and inefficient. This suggests a potential shift in immigration policy towards prioritizing economic contributions.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, a refurbished tech marketplace, reports tripled sales following Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting Americans may shift to used devices to avoid higher prices on new electronics. Analysts agree that prolonged tariffs could boost the refurbished market. While some believe consumers will eventually return to buying new tech, the CEO anticipates a significant increase in U.S. sales of refurbished devices due to the tariffs. The situation highlights the potential impact of trade policies on consumer behavior and the circular economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an ACLU appeal. The court's order halts removals until further notice, citing concerns about due process. The Trump administration claims the men are "foreign terrorists", while the ACLU argues they are being denied their legal rights. The case highlights the ongoing legal battles surrounding immigration enforcement and the use of wartime laws.</p>

            <p>British RAF Typhoon jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to NATO airspace near Poland in separate incidents this week. The intercepts, part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing, involved a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M intelligence aircraft and an unknown aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace. The UK's commitment to NATO is "unshakable" as Russian aggression grows, said Minister for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard. The mission shows our ability to operate side by side with NATO's newest member Sweden and to defend the Alliance's airspace whenever needed, keeping us safe at home and strong abroad.</p>
