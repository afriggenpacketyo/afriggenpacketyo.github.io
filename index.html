          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm distributing to major UK supermarkets like Tesco and Lidl, has fallen victim to a ransomware attack, disrupting order processing and deliveries. The firm is working on workarounds to minimize the impact, but some suppliers fear significant product wastage if delays persist. This incident follows similar cyber-attacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of supply chains. A ransomware attack involves hackers encrypting a victim's data and demanding payment to restore access. </p>

          <p>A new agri-food deal between the UK and EU is expected to reverse a ban on certain British-grown plants being sold in Northern Ireland, addressing issues stemming from the original Brexit deal. This political declaration, once converted into a legally binding text, aims to align the UK with EU plant health rules, potentially boosting the range of available plants and reducing costs for garden centers. While customs declarations will persist for most commercial goods, the deal is viewed as a positive step towards easing trade friction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </p>

          <p>Benjamin Ritchie, convicted of killing a police officer in 2000, was executed in Indiana, marking the state's second execution in 15 years. Ritchie had apologized for his actions, but his clemency bid was rejected. His attorneys argued that he suffered from brain damage due to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure, which should have been considered during his trial. The execution has drawn criticism, as Indiana is one of the few states that bars media witnesses. </p>
