          <p>A mass shooting outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and fourteen others wounded. According to police, assailants in a dark vehicle opened fire on a crowd leaving an album release party before fleeing the scene. The incident occurred at the same location as a previous mass shooting in November 2022, when the venue was under different management. Authorities have confirmed there were multiple shooters, and an investigation is ongoing with no arrests made yet.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, a so-called "narco sub," equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna for the first time. The drone vessel, discovered off the Caribbean coast, was not carrying drugs and is believed to have been on a trial run for the Gulf Clan cartel. Officials note that this marks a significant evolution in drug trafficking, as unmanned subs are harder to detect and eliminate the risk of crew members being captured and cooperating with authorities. The use of sophisticated, autonomous technology highlights the escalating technological race between law enforcement and powerful drug cartels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After hours of delay and intense pressure from party leadership, the House passed a crucial procedural vote to advance President Trump's signature legislative package. The bill, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on defense and border security, faced resistance from a small group of Republican holdouts who were concerned about changes made by the Senate. Speaker Mike Johnson kept the vote open for nearly six hours overnight to secure the necessary support, with Trump also personally engaging with lawmakers to push the bill forward. A final vote on the legislation is expected to take place shortly.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court has delivered a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision preserves legal access to abortion services throughout the state, resolving a key legal question that emerged after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The ruling clarifies the legal landscape for reproductive rights in Wisconsin, affirming that the historical statute cannot be used to enforce a near-total ban on the procedure. This outcome keeps abortion access in place for the foreseeable future within the state.</p>

          <p>Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern, was killed in a shooting in Washington, D.C. on Monday night. Tarpinian-Jachym, who was interning for Kansas Representative Ron Estes, was not believed to be the intended target of the attack, which also injured two other people. According to police, multiple suspects exited a vehicle and opened fire on a group of people.

          <p>Arsenal Football Club is reportedly accelerating its efforts to sign new attacking players this summer, with a primary focus on acquiring a new centre-forward. The club is said to be pursuing either RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko or Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, with both deals potentially costing over £70 million. Additionally, the Gunners are exploring options for creative midfielders, with interest in players like Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. The final cost of a new striker will likely influence how much the club can spend to strengthen other areas of the attack.</p>

          <p>A new report from a UK police watchdog has found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence provided by the city council. The inspectorate stated that some documents were so censored they were impossible to assess for evidential value, particularly affecting two major operations investigating child sexual exploitation. While the report noted that Greater Manchester Police has since made significant improvements in its approach, past failings have led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" for some victims. A new information-sharing protocol has now been established between the police, council, and prosecutors.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent actions, specifically his domestic policy bill and military strike on Iran, confirm his presidency as a continuation of long-standing American political traditions. The author contends that despite his populist rhetoric, Trump has doubled down on both neoliberalism, exemplified by a tax bill favoring the wealthy, and neoconservatism, seen in his aggressive foreign policy. The piece suggests that instead of representing a break from the past, Trump's presidency has reinforced the very political consensus on markets and militarism that has dominated the U.S. for the last half-century, disappointing those who hoped for a fundamental change.</p>

Kashanian, who has no criminal record and a long history of community service, was detained just hours after U.S. airstrikes in Iran. She initially arrived on a student visa in 1978 and was later granted a stay of removal, a status her family says she has always complied with.

Both politicians praised the camp's harsh conditions and natural security, with DeSantis highlighting the presence of alligators and pythons. The tour marks a public reconciliation between the two former rivals, united over what critics call a shared passion for dehumanizing immigration policies. The event underscores the Trump administration's theatrical and aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which advocates have described as cruel and performative.</p>

          <p>Gary Shteyngart's latest novel, "Vera, or Faith," is reviewed as a slim but potent story told from the perspective of a sharp 10-year-old girl navigating her parents' crumbling marriage and America's declining democracy. The book explores themes of immigrant life, wealth, and neurosis against the backdrop of a near-future America where a nativist constitutional amendment threatens to create second-class citizens. The review praises Shteyngart's ability to use a child's point of view to expose adult emotional failings and the brutal simplicities of a world in crisis. The novel is seen as a poignant commentary on both our current political moment and the timeless predicament of childhood.</p>

          <p>A significant ideological gap is widening between young men and women in South Korea, a trend reflected in recent election results where men in their 20s and 30s overwhelmingly supported conservative candidates. Experts suggest this political polarization is fueled by young men's perception that they are victims of gender discrimination and by economic anxieties in a hypercompetitive job market. This phenomenon, which defies traditional left-right political analysis, is driven by a backlash against feminism and resentment towards an older generation perceived to have had greater economic opportunities. This growing divide raises concerns about the future of South Korea's social cohesion and democratic health.</p>

The settlement has caused anger within CBS News, where many viewed the lawsuit as frivolous and the payment as a corporate capitulation to clear the way for Paramount's merger with Skydance Media. However, some relief exists within the news division that the settlement did not include a forced apology or retraction. The outcome highlights the intense pressure on media organizations navigating corporate interests and political conflicts.</p>

          <p>State and local records reveal that federal contractors improperly sent truckloads of asbestos-contaminated debris from recent wildfires to nonhazardous landfills in the Los Angeles area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its contractor failed to review test results for asbestos before shipping the waste, which was later confirmed to contain the hazardous material. This lapse exposed landfill workers, who were not wearing adequate respiratory protection, to potential harm and has amplified community concerns about the risks of disposing wildfire debris in local facilities. Regulators are now investigating the incident and ordering new safety protocols for landfill operators.</p>

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmentalists is advancing a plan to restore a portion of Tulare Lake, once the largest freshwater body west of the Mississippi River. The proposal involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland in the San Joaquin Valley to create a new reservoir and wetlands. Supporters argue the project would provide critical flood protection, create new wildlife habitat, and restore a site of cultural significance to the Tachi Yokut Tribe. The ambitious plan faces challenges, including securing nearly $1 billion in funding and acquiring the necessary land from its current owners.</p>

City leaders are now questioning the department's protocols and demanding more transparency to ensure residents can distinguish between legitimate law enforcement and potential criminals. In response, the LAPD has created new guidelines requiring supervisors to verify agents' identities, but maintains it has no authority to interfere with federal operations.</p>

However, a chance encounter with a kind immigrant family running a motel in Shamrock, Texas, temporarily restores his faith.

This move follows community outcry over the city's initial response to the heightened ICE activity in the predominantly Latino community.

Independent analysis contradicts the White House's claim that the bill reduces the deficit, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating it will add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national debt over ten years. The article also refutes Trump's assertion that Medicaid will be left untouched, citing studies that project significant cuts and a loss of coverage for nearly 12 million Americans.

          <p>Israel's ability to quickly achieve air superiority during its recent conflict with Iran demonstrates that dominating the skies is still possible in modern warfare, but experts caution against drawing broad conclusions. This article argues that Iran's capabilities, while notable, are not comparable to the sophisticated, integrated air defense networks and powerful air forces of near-peer adversaries like Russia or China. A potential conflict with these nations would present a far greater challenge, likely preventing sustained air supremacy and forcing a shift in Western military strategy.

          <p>In an interview, Democratic Representative Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania detailed his strong opposition to the Republican-led budget and tax reconciliation bill. He criticized the legislation for its deep cuts to social programs, particularly Medicaid, while providing extensive tax breaks that he argues primarily benefit the wealthy and corporations. Deluzio highlighted the potential negative impact on working families and vulnerable populations in his state and across the country. His remarks underscore the Democratic party's strategy to frame the bill as a massive betrayal of the American people, setting the stage for future political battles over its consequences.</p>

          <p>This article profiles American professional cyclist Matteo Jorgenson, a rising star known for his rare combination of size and climbing ability. Standing at 6-foot-4, Jorgenson defies the typical build for a general classification contender, yet his impressive performances, including a top-10 finish in the Tour de France, have put him in the spotlight. The piece traces his journey from Boise, Idaho, to the top tier of European cycling with team Visma–Lease a Bike. While he is currently a support rider for two-time Tour winner Jonas Vingegaard, Jorgenson expresses a patient ambition to one day lead a team and win a Grand Tour himself.</p>

          <h2>GOP Governors Remain Largely Silent on Proposed Medicaid Cuts in Trump's Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike in 2017, when Republican governors were a key force in blocking Medicaid cuts, most are now remaining publicly silent as Congress moves to pass a bill with historic reductions to the program. The legislation, championed by President Trump, would cut about $1 trillion from Medicaid over a decade, largely by imposing new work requirements and paperwork demands in states that expanded the program. While Democratic governors have been vocal in their opposition, their GOP counterparts in the 19 affected states have said little, providing political cover for lawmakers from their states to support the deep cuts.</p>
