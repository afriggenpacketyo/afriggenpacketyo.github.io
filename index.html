          <p>The FBI has announced that DNA found on a towel wrapped around the suspected murder weapon and on a screwdriver from the crime scene has been positively matched to Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. Investigators also discovered a note at the suspect's home indicating his intent to "take out" Kirk. Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance hosted a tribute episode of Kirk's podcast, condemning the political violence and those who he claimed celebrate the assassination.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a move he believes would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. The idea, which would require SEC approval, has been previously supported by business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. Proponents of the current system argue that quarterly reporting provides essential transparency and timely information for investors, and that less frequent updates could increase market volatility.

The couple had gone on the run to prevent their fifth child from being taken into care, living in a tent in freezing temperatures, which ultimately led to the infant's death.</p>

          <p>A number of individuals across various industries, including media, academia, and aviation, have been fired or placed on leave for making public comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for public statements that could damage the business's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents highlight the professional risks associated with commenting on politically charged events in the current climate, where employers are increasingly mindful of their public image.</p>

          <p>The Senate is voting on President Trump's nomination of economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board, a move that has sparked significant controversy. Democrats and other critics have raised alarms over Miran's plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role rather than resigning, arguing it could compromise the Fed's crucial political independence. The concern is amplified by Miran's past writings, which have advocated for shortening Fed board members' terms and reducing the central bank's autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article, written by a urologist, explains the medical condition of urinary retention, where the bladder cannot fully empty despite feeling full. The causes can range from temporary issues like constipation or side effects from medications such as decongestants and antihistamines, to more serious underlying problems like an enlarged prostate in men or nerve damage. The author stresses the importance of recognizing symptoms like a weak stream and seeking medical advice, especially if one is completely unable to urinate, which constitutes a medical emergency.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the public and political reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk has dangerously departed from the shared national grief seen after past political killings, instead becoming a tool for partisan division. The author contends that the event is being weaponized to undermine free speech protections and foster a climate of fear, where expressing dissenting views can lead to professional ruin. The article expresses deep concern that this trend signifies a severe deterioration of democratic principles and civil discourse in the country.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he would "never" have appointed Lord Peter Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US if he had been aware of the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer sacked the peer after emails from 2008 were published showing Mandelson offering supportive messages to Epstein around the time of his conviction. The Prime Minister's judgment in making the initial appointment has been questioned, adding to a period of turmoil for his government.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, individuals who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election are being appointed to local election boards, raising significant concerns about the potential for partisan interference in future elections. In key states like Georgia and Arizona, these appointments have led to legal battles and political standoffs, as voting rights advocates and Democratic officials fear these new members could disrupt election administration and refuse to certify valid results. This trend is seen as a strategy to delegitimize the democratic process from within.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Trymaine Lee explores the profound personal impact of his career spent covering gun violence and the deaths of Black Americans. A near-fatal heart attack at age 38 forced him to confront the immense stress and trauma he had internalized from repeatedly reporting on stories of lives cut short. The book serves as both a personal reflection and a historical examination of the systemic roots of violence in Black communities.</p>
