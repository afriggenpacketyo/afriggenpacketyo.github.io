          <p>Following a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former President Donald Trump has publicly called for an end to the war in Ukraine by freezing the current battle lines. This proposal would effectively cede control of the occupied Donbas region to Russia. The meeting reportedly became a "shouting match" after Trump rejected Zelenskyy's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, which Kyiv views as essential for its defense. Trump suggested both sides should "claim Victory" and allow history to decide the outcome, a stance that has caused alarm among Ukrainian officials and allies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a federal law prohibiting unlawful drug users from possessing firearms is a violation of the Second Amendment. The case comes after a federal appeals court found the law unconstitutional, a decision the Trump administration is now appealing. This legal challenge is one of several recent gun rights cases to reach the high court, which established a new standard for evaluating firearm restrictions in a landmark 2022 ruling that focuses on historical tradition. The outcome will have significant implications for the scope of gun control legislation in the nation.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are investigating allegations that Prince Andrew asked his taxpayer-funded bodyguard to acquire personal information about Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexual abuse. Leaked emails reportedly show the prince passing Giuffre's date of birth and Social Security number to the officer in 2011, shortly before a controversial photo of the two was released. These new claims emerge just as Andrew relinquished his royal titles due to his connection with the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, adding another layer of scrutiny to his conduct.</p>

          <p>Thieves executed a daring daytime robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris, stealing eight priceless treasures from the Apollon Gallery, which houses the French crown jewels. Among the stolen items were a pearl and diamond tiara commissioned by Napoleon III, an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to his second wife, and a sapphire set once worn by Queen Marie-Amélie. In their hasty escape, the robbers dropped the crown of Empress Eugenie, which was later recovered outside the museum. The incident has triggered a massive investigation and raised serious questions about security at the world-renowned institution.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), originating from its main U.S. East Coast data center, caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites and online services. The issue was attributed to DNS problems with DynamoDB, a core database service, affecting companies like Disney+, Reddit, United Airlines, and even government websites. While AWS reported that it was seeing signs of recovery after several hours, the event highlighted the global internet's heavy reliance on a small number of major cloud infrastructure providers.

          <h2>China Increases Crude Oil Imports from Russia Despite U.S. Pressure</h2>

          <p>Russia maintained its position as China's top supplier of crude oil in September, highlighting a deepening energy relationship despite U.S. pressure on major economies to limit their reliance on Russian resources. This trend coincides with a suspension of Chinese purchases of U.S. crude oil since June. Analysts suggest that China's continued and increased Russian oil imports may be a strategic act of defiance amid ongoing trade negotiations and geopolitical tensions with the United States. This move underscores China's prioritization of energy security through diversified, and politically aligned, sourcing.</p>

          <p>Europe has become a key battleground for the global autonomous driving industry, with several Chinese tech startups expanding their trials and partnerships across the continent. This pivot toward Europe is driven by U.S. restrictions on Chinese AI technologies and offers an opportunity for China to influence global standards in data, safety, and AI ethics. As Chinese firms like WeRide and Baidu's Apollo Go integrate into Europe's automotive ecosystem, they are not only competing for market share but are also central to the continent's debate over technological sovereignty and geopolitical influence.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a high-profile jewelry heist at the Louvre, the French government has announced it will tighten security measures at cultural institutions across the country. The decision came after the justice minister publicly stated that security protocols had "failed," allowing thieves to steal priceless items in broad daylight and giving France a "terrible image." Experts fear that if the perpetrators are not caught quickly, the stolen jewels, including a historic necklace given by Napoleon to his wife, will be broken apart and smuggled out of the country.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to stop using his royal titles has not quelled the public and political scrutiny surrounding his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There are ongoing calls for his titles, such as the Duke of York, to be formally removed by an act of Parliament. The pressure on him is intensifying with the posthumous publication of a memoir by his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, and a separate police investigation into allegations that he misused a protection officer. The Royal Family is reportedly treating the ongoing claims with "very great concern."</p>

          <p>Environmental scientist Tom Van Lent, who was jailed for 10 days for contempt of court, is now alleging that the case against him by his former employer, the Everglades Foundation, was based on fraud. The foundation sued Van Lent after he publicly criticized a DeSantis-backed restoration project, claiming he violated an employment contract by keeping "trade secrets." Van Lent's attorney now asserts that the signed contract does not exist and was fabricated to build the case. The foundation denies the allegation, stating an employee handbook serves as a legally binding agreement.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, Republican lawmakers and conservative groups are launching a campaign to build statues and other memorials in his honor across the United States. Proposed legislation in states like Florida and Oklahoma would require public universities to create these memorials, with threats of withholding funding for non-compliance. Critics argue that this rapid push is a cynical political maneuver to capitalize on Kirk's death, promote a rightwing cultural agenda, and lionize a figure known for holding controversial and divisive views.</p>

          <p>A revolutionary eye implant has allowed a group of blind patients to read again in a life-changing international clinical trial. The procedure involves inserting a tiny 2mm-square microchip under the retina of patients with geographic atrophy, an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration. Patients wear special glasses with a camera that sends video images to the implant, which then transmits signals to the brain. A surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, where five patients received the implant, called the results "astounding" and a major advance in restoring meaningful vision.</p>
