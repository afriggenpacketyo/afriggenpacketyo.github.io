          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. Ward's selection marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen first overall, highlighting the position's importance in the NFL. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, while other notable picks included Abdul Carter to the Giants and Will Campbell to the Patriots. The draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was noted for its unpredictability compared to previous years, with a focus on offensive and defensive lines.</p>

After being teased by his co-hosts, Parsons claimed excitement about the pick, rationalizing that he wanted to see talent added to his side of the ball. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea rich in gas and oil, could become a flashpoint between China and the Philippines. This is especially true if Manila pursues unilateral resource exploration to bolster its energy security. However, factors such as Manila's limited development capacity, upcoming elections, and cautious risk assessment by multinational companies may delay this escalation. Reed Bank is claimed by both Beijing and Manila, and joint development efforts have been stalled due to ongoing tensions.</p>

Judge William Orrick issued a temporary injunction, stating that Trump's executive orders were unconstitutional and caused irreparable harm to these jurisdictions. The ruling prohibits the federal government from taking action to withhold or condition federal funds and requires written notice of the order to be provided to all federal departments and agencies. This decision echoes a previous ruling against a similar Trump order in 2017.</p>

          <p>China could enhance its soft power in Africa by adopting a non-governmental organization (NGO) model to complement its existing state-led investments, according to an analysis. While China has heavily invested in infrastructure projects across Africa, its engagement has often lacked grassroots relationships and community involvement. Western nations, in contrast, have cultivated a vibrant NGO ecosystem that fosters social services and community ties. Embracing an NGO model could help China address criticisms of neocolonialism and strengthen its human connections across the continent.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, potentially reversing over a decade of U.S. policy. During his first term, Trump had expressed openness to the idea, despite the Obama administration and Western allies rejecting Russia's annexation of the peninsula. This potential shift would depart from the official "Crimea Declaration" issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged to maintain the nonrecognition policy until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny, but the situation is less about him and more about broader divisions within the Trump administration regarding foreign policy, particularly concerning Iran. Hegseth, an Iran hawk, has been targeted amid ongoing Iran nuclear negotiations. Recent firings of officials with ties to Hegseth reveal deep-seated disagreements on foreign policy, with some viewing the dismissals as an attempt to undermine Iran hawks. The controversy highlights the administration's internal struggles and the ongoing debate over its approach to Iran.</p>
