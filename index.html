          <h2>US Economy Exceeds Expectations with 3% Q2 Growth Despite Tariff Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 11:10:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a robust 3% annual rate in the second quarter, significantly surpassing analyst predictions and reversing a prior decline. This stronger-than-expected growth was primarily fueled by a substantial turnaround in the trade balance and renewed consumer spending, occurring even amidst President Trump's tariff policies. Despite this positive GDP report, the Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to maintain current interest rates, resisting presidential pressure to lower them due to persistent inflation risks and concerns about tariff impacts. The article highlights that while the headline number is strong, underlying measures like final sales to private domestic purchasers showed a slowdown, indicating a complex economic landscape that requires careful monitoring of demand.

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unveiled his vision for "personal superintelligence," emphasizing individual empowerment over automation, a stance he contrasts with other industry approaches. This strategic direction follows Meta's substantial investment of billions in acquiring top AI researchers and engineers in recent weeks, leading to the establishment of Meta Superintelligence Labs under Alexandr Wang. The company aims to develop foundational AI models like the open-source Llama family, signaling that the rest of this decade will be decisive for AI's trajectory and its societal impact. This article highlights Meta's commitment to prioritizing superintelligence as a tool for personal empowerment, rather than a force for widespread job automation, despite past expensive ventures like the metaverse.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Against Viral Watermelon-Only Weight Loss Diet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 11:00:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "watermelon diet," a viral TikTok trend promoting rapid weight loss and detox through exclusive watermelon consumption for several days, is drawing criticism from health experts. While watermelon offers hydration and some benefits, physicians like Dr. Mark Hyman warn that this restrictive diet severely lacks essential nutrients like protein, healthy fats, and fiber, potentially leading to temporary water and muscle loss rather than sustainable fat reduction. Nutritionists agree a strict watermelon diet is unsustainable and can cause electrolyte imbalances, blood sugar spikes, and negative impacts on mood and sleep. The article stresses that true, long-term health improvement comes from diverse, nutrient-dense foods, quality sleep, stress management, and movement, not internet fads.</p>

The discussion refutes historical justifications for tariffs, such as their supposed role in industrial growth or fixing trade imbalances, emphasizing that such policies disproportionately burden lower-income households while potentially financing tax cuts for the wealthy.

          <p>The Department of Justice is actively pushing for the release of grand jury transcripts related to the sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, amidst intense public scrutiny and conspiracy theories. The DoJ disclosed that only two law enforcement witnesses testified before the separate grand juries that led to their sex trafficking indictments, a detail revealed in court filings. This move comes as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information about Epstein's extensive network and activities. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring in the sexual trafficking of minors, has also offered to testify before Congress under specific conditions, including immunity.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are providing five key strategies to help savers maximize their Certificate of Deposit (CD) returns this August, navigating recent inflation spikes and economic uncertainties. Recommendations include diligently shopping for the best rates, especially from online banks that often offer higher yields, and wisely choosing shorter-term CDs (around six to 12 months) due to the current inverted yield curve. The article also strongly advises utilizing CD laddering to hedge against future rate shifts and cautions against allowing CDs to auto-renew at potentially lower rates. Additionally, considering no-penalty or bump-up CDs offers valuable flexibility for those hesitant about long-term commitments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly begun personally screening nominees for four-star general positions, a significant departure from established military norms that typically involve the defense secretary. The White House confirmed this move, stating it ensures "war fighters first—not bureaucrats," yet it is raising widespread worries about the potential politicization of the military's top ranks. Critics, including journalists and political scientists, warn that such actions could severely undermine the nonpartisan nature of military leadership and pose a fundamental danger to the constitutional system of government.

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad, the controversial top vaccine official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has departed his post after less than four months in a role overseeing biological products like vaccines. Prasad, an oncologist and professor, was controversially appointed in May, having previously been a fierce critic of the FDA and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. His exit, confirmed by HHS, was reportedly because he "did not want to be a distraction" to the Trump administration. During his brief tenure, the FDA made unusual regulatory decisions, including limiting COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and declining approvals for certain biotech therapies, raising concerns among investors and patient advocates.</p>

          <p>E.coli infections, specifically the Shiga toxin-producing type (STEC), rose significantly by 26% in England last year, with young children disproportionately affected.

The article emphasizes the critical importance of hand hygiene, especially for children, and adherence to food safety practices to prevent the spread of this bacteria.

While alcohol may temporarily lower blood pressure and stress immediately after consumption, it leads to a rebound increase in sympathetic nervous system activity hours later and can interfere with sleep quality. Experts emphasize that consistent alcohol use, even at moderate levels, correlates with a higher risk of developing hypertension. The article recommends healthier relaxation alternatives such as regular exercise, yoga, creative hobbies, or spending time with loved ones, underscoring that regularly relying on alcohol for relaxation is ill-advised for cardiovascular well-being.</p>
