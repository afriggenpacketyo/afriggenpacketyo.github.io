Ed Sheeran's secret set on the New Music stage was a highlight for those who got in, but left many disappointed due to capacity limits. The festival also emphasized female talent, with acts like Self Esteem and Lola Young showcasing the depth and breadth of women in music, and special bins were provided for disposable vapes in anticipation of the upcoming ban.</p>

          <p>Winemakers in Burgundy, France, are expressing concerns over President Trump's tariffs on European Union products, with the US being their biggest export market. Trump had initially threatened a 200% markup on alcohol from Europe and imposed a 20% tariff, later reduced to 10%, with a potential increase back to 20% in July. The president of the Burgundy Wine Board noted that the US market was booming until Trump's re-election, and the previous 25% tariff during Trump's first presidency significantly affected sales. Winemakers fear a return to a stalled market if tariffs increase again in July.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on the cases of two former City traders jailed for rigging interest rates, amid concerns of miscarriages of justice. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were convicted of manipulating Libor and Euribor, but evidence emerged that central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct. US courts overturned similar convictions, but in the UK, they remain convicted criminals. Senior politicians are concerned that the traders have been "scapegoated" and are calling for a public inquiry into interest rate rigging.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a delay in the implementation of planned 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Trump's decision to postpone the tariffs comes after he previously threatened a 20% tariff on most EU goods, which was later halved to 10% with a deadline of July 8.</p>

          <p>Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique is experiencing a revival in both wildlife populations and the surrounding communities. Decades of war had decimated the park's animal populations, but thanks to efforts by American entrepreneur Greg Carr, wildlife is abundant once again. Carr's vision extends beyond animals, focusing on human development by creating jobs, supporting education, and empowering women. The park is also exploring ecotourism and selling carbon credits to ensure self-sustainability and benefit the local communities, demonstrating a commitment to both environmental and social well-being.</p>

          <p>A mosaic that once adorned one of Emperor Caligula's lavish party ships was discovered in New York City, where it had been used as a coffee table for decades. The mosaic, made of marble and porphyry, was part of the inlaid floor of the ship, which was sunk in Lake Nemi after Caligula's assassination. After being unearthed in the 19th century and later displayed in a museum commissioned by Mussolini, the mosaic disappeared after World War II. It was eventually identified in a Manhattan apartment and seized by prosecutors, who returned it to the Nemi Museum in 2021.</p>

The overnight attack saw Russia launch 367 drones and missiles, the highest number in a single night since the full-scale invasion in 2022, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries. Zelensky stated that "America's silence, and the silence of others, only encourages Putin," and warned that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without stronger pressure.
