          <p>China's export growth slowed in May, rising 4.8% year-on-year, falling short of expectations due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding US tariffs, indicating persistent challenges in the manufacturing and trade sectors. Imports also declined by 3.4% compared to the previous year, contrasting with predictions of a slight increase. Despite these declines, China's trade surplus increased to $103.2 billion. These figures suggest that Beijing's stimulus measures have not been sufficient to boost domestic consumption amid trade tensions with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the harmful impacts of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed. This initiative, subject to a 12-week consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and their habitats. </p>

          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, potentially leading to strike action. The Royal College of Nursing has dismissed the award as "grotesque," and the vote is crucial in determining next steps. The nurses are being balloted on strike action over pay. Other health unions are organizing votes on the pay awards. (not investment advice)</p>
