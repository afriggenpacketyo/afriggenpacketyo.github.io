          <p>Chinese trend-toy maker Pop Mart is increasing prices on its Labubu character in the US and shifting production to Vietnam due to the US-China tariff war. The company plans to introduce Labubu 3.0 globally, pricing it at US$28 in the US, a notable increase from the previous series' US$22 price point, to protect profit margins. According to Richard Lin, chief consumer analyst at SPDB International, Pop Mart is considered a high-end toy brand overseas, giving it pricing power; the company may also raise prices on existing collections if tariffs significantly impact costs.</p>

          <p>Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister at 99 years old, continues to command attention and respect in the country. Having served for 22 years starting in 1981, Mahathir transformed Malaysia from a tin, rubber, and palm oil-dependent nation into a major high-tech exporter. His legacy is viewed with a mix of admiration for his economic achievements and criticism for his authoritarian style and preferential treatment of the Malay population. This article delves into his reflections on his time in office and his views on Malaysia's current state.</p>

          <p>The United States is reinforcing its military presence in the "first island chain," which includes Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, to deter China's military expansion into the Pacific Ocean. The deployment of B-1B strategic bombers to Misawa, Japan, is a key component of this strategy. This move signals US resolve to Beijing, especially amid concerns about the US commitment to Europe and NATO under the Trump administration, aiming to reassure allies in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, accusing him of harming peace negotiations. Trump hinted that the US might be willing to formally recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea as part of a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. This stance contradicts Ukraine's long-held position that it will not give up Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.</p>

          <p>More than six million illegal vaping products have been seized in England over the past three years, as authorities crack down on illicit trade. These vapes often exceed legal limits for tank size and nicotine strength, posing health risks to consumers. A ban on single-use disposable vapes is set to take effect on June 1, with increased enforcement and funding to combat the issue. The illegal vape trade is linked to sophisticated networks involved in serious criminal activities, including modern-day slavery and drug supply.</p>
