          <h2>Public Opinion Divided on Tesla and Elon Musk, Survey Shows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 14:23:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey reveals that approximately half of Americans hold a negative view of both Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. This sentiment is fueled by concerns over Musk's controversial political activities, including his support for President Donald Trump's administration's policies on cutting government employment. The survey highlights a significant divide, with Democrats and independents expressing disapproval while Republicans remain largely supportive. This polarization poses a challenge for Tesla, as potential customers are more enthusiastic about electric vehicles in general than about the company itself.</p>

          <p>Gold prices experienced volatility, initially rallying to a record high following President Donald Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve, which spooked investors. However, prices later retreated as hopes emerged that trade tensions between the U.S. and China might ease after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a de-escalation was likely. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, and central banks have been increasing their gold reserves. Analysts suggest further upside potential for gold due to ongoing investment demand and a volatile macroeconomic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla short sellers have amassed substantial profits of $11.5 billion in 2025 as the company's stock price has plummeted. The decline is attributed to factors such as concerns over President Trump's tariffs impacting production costs and increasing competition in the electric vehicle market. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration, particularly his role in reducing the size of the federal government, has also led to protests and brand damage. Tesla faces challenges in competing with lower-cost rivals in China and is lagging in the robotaxi market, further contributing to the stock's decline.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired several immigration judges, raising concerns about due process for migrants as the administration aims to increase deportations. These firings exacerbate existing vacancies in immigration courts, contributing to a backlog of millions of cases. Critics argue that removing judges hinders the goal of increasing deportations, while the administration pushes for faster case reviews.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued an executive order targeting a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The order seeks to eliminate the discrepancy between small-molecule drugs and biologics, potentially increasing Medicare spending and drug prices. While this move is seen as a win for pharmaceutical companies, the order also includes proposals opposed by the industry, such as allowing more drug imports from Canada.

Tesla vehicles have become targets for vandals, often in protest of CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration.

          <p>Following an attack on prison guards by Hashem Abedi, brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, the UK Justice Secretary has announced a trial of Tasers in prisons. Three guards were hospitalized after the attack, prompting calls for better protection for prison staff. The Prison Officers' Association has advocated for wider use of Tasers, arguing that a trial is unnecessary. The trial aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of using electric stun guns in prison settings.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears likely to side with parents seeking the right to opt their children out of public school instruction involving storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation. The case involves a dispute with the Montgomery County Board of Education in Maryland. The court's conservative justices expressed concern about the denial of opt-out options for parents with religious objections. The decision could set a precedent for parental rights in public education regarding sensitive topics.</p>
