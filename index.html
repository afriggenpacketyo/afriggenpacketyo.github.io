          <p>Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, stated that the Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus for migrants, which is the right to challenge detention in court. Miller argued that the Constitution allows suspension during an invasion, echoing the administration's claim of an 'invasion' of undocumented migrants. Legal experts argue that Congress must authorize such a suspension, citing historical precedent. This potential move raises concerns about due process and constitutional rights for immigrants. The article provides context by mentioning previous instances where habeas corpus was suspended in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, from immigration detention, stating her detention could chill free speech. Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student, was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa based on an essay critical of Israel. The judge emphasized the lack of evidence linking her to any threat and criticized the government's reliance on the op-ed as justification.
