          <p>IBM announced first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, driven by their hybrid cloud and AI strategy. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 against an expected $1.40, and revenue of $14.54 billion versus the $14.4 billion projection. IBM has maintained its full-year guidance, expecting at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency and $13.5 billion in free cash flow. However, IBM has become more cautious about the contribution of consulting, and they also noted that uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment may cause clients to pause before making buying decisions.

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill reported lower-than-anticipated quarterly revenue, with same-store sales declining for the first time since 2020, due to a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather conditions.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs, including those on auto parts imported from China and levies on steel and aluminum. This follows lobbying efforts from automakers and auto policy groups seeking relief from accumulating tariffs. While autos were previously exempted from reciprocal geographical tariffs, the industry still faces levies on steel, aluminum, and imported vehicles. The potential exemptions could provide some relief to automakers facing increased costs due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota state employee who vandalized multiple Tesla vehicles avoided criminal charges, leading to criticism of Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, with some accusing her of operating a two-tiered justice system that protects Democrats. Republicans have condemned the decision, noting that the Trump administration has identified Tesla vandalism as "domestic terrorism." Critics argue that the prosecutor's leniency sends a dangerous message that political violence is acceptable and that the county attorney has been soft on crime since taking office in 2023.</p>
