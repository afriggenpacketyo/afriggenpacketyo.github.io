            <p>Hashem Abedi, brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, leaving them with serious injuries including burns and stab wounds. Abedi, already serving a sentence for his involvement in the 2017 bombing, used hot cooking oil and homemade weapons in the assault. The Prison Service confirmed the incident and stated that police are investigating, while Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the violence and vowed to pursue the strongest possible punishment. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick expressed serious concerns about the prison leadership's ability to contain the threat from Islamist extremist inmates.</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among consumers and businesses. The imposition of tariffs, followed by exemptions and pauses, has led to erratic buying behavior, with some consumers stocking up on goods while others feel paralyzed by uncertainty. Economists predict that these tariffs will lead to higher prices for consumers, potentially costing the average US family thousands of dollars annually. This instability is also impacting businesses, with some canceling shipments from China and others introducing tariff surcharges, raising concerns about potential shortages and economic slowdown.

            <p>Colossal Biosciences, known for its efforts to revive extinct species, has unveiled three puppies, claiming they have created a 'de-extincted' dire wolf, but scientists have refuted this, stating they have created a new animal. Concerns are raised about the welfare of these animals, as they lack kin and a natural habitat. Critics argue that resources would be better spent on saving existing endangered species, rather than resurrecting extinct ones. There is also the argument that conservation efforts are undermined by the idea that species can be brought back.</p>

            <p>Former President Barack Obama's preference for medium-well steak has ignited debate among culinary enthusiasts. While many steak purists consider anything beyond medium a culinary faux pas, Obama defends his choice, stating that's simply how he enjoys it. Cooking steak to medium-well, which reaches an internal temperature of 145 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, ensures food safety by eliminating harmful bacteria. The article also contrasts Obama's steak preference with that of former President Donald Trump, who reportedly enjoys his steak well-done with ketchup.</p>

            <p>California's sea lion population is being severely affected by toxic algae blooms, with rescue teams overwhelmed by the number of sick animals. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the algae, is causing seizures and heart failure in sea lions, dolphins, and birds. SeaWorld's rescue team has doubled its staff to handle the surge in calls and rescues, with 2025 potentially being the worst year yet. Warming oceans, potentially exacerbated by debris from recent wildfires, are contributing to the extreme algae blooms.</p>

            <p>President Trump has authorized the US military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border, citing a need to secure the boundary and repel invasions. The memorandum allows the Department of Defense to take jurisdiction over federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation. This action would grant troops the legal right to detain immigrants accused of trespassing, raising concerns about potential violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. The order excludes native reservations, and the Defense Secretary will assess the initial phase after 45 days.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced it would exclude certain electronics, such as smartphones and laptops, from its “reciprocal” tariffs. This decision could help keep prices down for consumer electronics that are not typically manufactured in the U.S. The move benefits major tech companies like Apple and Samsung, as well as chip manufacturers like Nvidia. Items qualifying for the exemption include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors, and certain chips, meaning they will not be subject to the current 145% tariffs on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere.</p>
