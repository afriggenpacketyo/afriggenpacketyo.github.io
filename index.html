          <p>Residents in Nevada are experiencing worsening food insecurity, with food banks seeing a significant increase in demand due to rising grocery prices and fixed incomes. The situation is compounded by recent changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) under a new federal spending plan, which places stricter requirements on recipients and shifts more costs to the states. Nonprofits warn that these factors are creating an uncertain future for many, with child hunger in Southern Nevada reportedly rising from 18% to 22% over the past year.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist who helped identify the SARS coronavirus in 2003, has warned that the emergence of another pandemic is "absolutely certain." He expressed concern that the world may not be significantly better prepared than it was before COVID-19, noting that animal viruses are jumping to humans with increasing frequency. Peiris emphasized that respiratory viruses pose a particular threat and called for a more integrated approach to global health that considers human, animal, and environmental factors to prevent future crises.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent fired at a moving vehicle in Southern California after the driver refused to comply with an immigration stop and sped away. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the driver struck two agents, prompting one to fire in self-defense, though no one was hit by the gunfire. Video taken by a passenger shows agents smashing the car's windows before it drives off, followed by the sound of shots, but does not show the agents being struck, creating a disputed account of the incident.</p>

          <p>After weeks of holding out in an effort to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, Texas Democrats have returned to the state capital. The lawmakers stated they were returning "victorious" after successfully killing a special legislative session and raising national awareness about the controversial voting maps. While their return allows the Republican majority to proceed with a vote, Democrats have vowed to continue their fight against the proposed maps in court, alleging they are discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that he was arranging a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Kremlin's response has been notably cautious. Russian officials stated only that Putin would consider "raising the level" of negotiations, avoiding a direct confirmation of a presidential-level summit. This ambiguity casts doubt on the feasibility of the proposed talks, as Moscow has previously questioned Zelenskyy's legitimacy and resisted direct engagement at the highest level, creating a potential roadblock for the U.S.-led peace initiative.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece examines the controversy surrounding China's plan to build a new, large-scale embassy at the historic former Royal Mint site in London. The author argues the project is a powerful symbol of China's rising global status and its long-term commitment to its relationship with the UK, contrasting it with Britain's recent sales of diplomatic properties. The article frames the dispute not just as a planning issue but as a microcosm of the complex UK-China relationship and a test of Britain's international standing.</p>

          <p>The article presents a critical analysis of the current generative AI era, arguing that society is in the grip of a collective delusion fueled by tech industry hype. It explores the disorienting societal effects, from the strange reanimation of the deceased for interviews to the widespread anxiety over job loss and the flooding of the internet with synthetic content. The author questions whether the technology will ever deliver on its grandest promises, suggesting the real danger is that we reorient our economy and culture around a technology that is merely "good enough" to be disruptive but not truly revolutionary.</p>
