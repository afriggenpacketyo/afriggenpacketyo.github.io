          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism for stating that he does not need to buy rice because he receives so much of it from supporters, at a time when soaring rice prices have squeezed households.

The government has been criticized for waiting to release stockpiled rice until prices had already risen significantly. Rising rice prices have added to the financial strain on consumers already dealing with rising costs of other food items and energy.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is banking on the public being tired of the Brexit debate as he navigates the UK's relationship with the EU. While the Conservatives have criticized the deal as "surrender," Reform UK is making a similar argument. Starmer's government believes that the public wants a smoother relationship with the EU within the existing parameters, and sees this deal as pragmatic common sense. The significance of this deal will depend on whether opposition parties choose to campaign on the issue.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government is proposing new rules to regulate the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, aiming to protect shoppers from debt traps and provide certainty for the industry. The new regulations will require BNPL firms to conduct upfront checks to ensure people can repay what they borrow and make it easier for customers to access refunds. Consumers will also be able to take BNPL complaints to the Financial Ombudsman.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its government austerity drive with new rules targeting white elephant projects, official vehicles, lavish meals, and meeting venue decor. The latest regulations, issued by the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council, urge officials to practice diligence and thrift and oppose extravagance and waste. Analysts say this move reflects Beijingâ€™s growing anxiety over mounting debts and aims to curb wasteful spending at various levels of government.</p>
