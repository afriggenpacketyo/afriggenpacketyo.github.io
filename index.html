          <p>Danish renewable energy company Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent it from blocking the completion of its Revolution Wind farm off the New England coast. The company alleges the Interior Department's stop-work order, issued on national security grounds, is a pretext for President Trump's long-standing animosity towards wind power. Orsted asserts that the 80% complete, fully permitted project, vital for powering over 350,000 homes, underwent extensive environmental reviews. This legal challenge underscores growing tensions between renewable energy projects and the current administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended his decision to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, accusing her of lying about facing pressure to preapprove vaccine recommendations. Kennedy cited alarming CDC data indicating that 76.4% of Americans now have a chronic disease, arguing that such figures necessitate leadership changes to restore the agency's public health mission. He asserted that "new blood" was essential to address the CDC's perceived failures, particularly concerning its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. His remarks highlight ongoing tensions and political scrutiny surrounding public health institutions.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Lorena, despite weakening, is projected to make landfall in western Mexico on Friday or early Saturday, bringing the possibility of life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. The storm, currently maintaining hurricane status with 75 mph sustained winds, is expected to degrade to a tropical storm later on Thursday. Parts of Baja California Sur and Sonora are under tropical storm warnings, with heavy rainfall totals of up to 15 inches anticipated. Southwestern U.S. states like Arizona and New Mexico could also experience significant rain and flash flooding through Saturday.</p>

The custom old mine brilliant cut ring was designed by New York goldsmith Kindred Lubeck.

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has declined to confirm whether he would dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner if his standards adviser concludes she breached the ministerial code. Rayner referred herself for investigation after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on an £800,000 flat, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice. Starmer stated he would act on the report's conclusions, which are expected soon, while rejecting comparisons to Boris Johnson's past handling of ministerial code breaches. The opposition has called for Rayner's resignation amid the ongoing inquiry into her tax payments.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is discontinuing flight service in a dozen cities by October 2nd, less than a week after filing for bankruptcy for the second time this year. The discount carrier aims to cut costs by eliminating unprofitable routes, citing "substantial doubt" about its ability to remain in business due to rising operation costs and weak demand. Rival airlines, including United and Frontier, are swiftly expanding their flight offerings to capture market share left by Spirit's withdrawal. This move reflects the challenging financial landscape for budget carriers and broader shifts in domestic leisure travel demand.</p>

          <p>NHS vascular surgeon Neil Hopper, 49, admitted to two counts of insurance fraud and three of possessing extreme pornography, after defrauding insurers of over £466,000. Hopper falsely claimed his self-inflicted leg injuries, which led to below-knee amputations in 2019, were due to sepsis, not self-mutilation. The court heard he had a "sexual interest in amputation" and used ice to freeze his own legs, concealing the true cause from medics.

          <p>India's relationship with the U.S. is severely strained, with some experts calling it "DEFCON 1," following increased U.S. tariffs on Indian exports due to India's significant purchases of Russian oil. Despite President Trump's mixed signals about the bilateral relationship, anti-American sentiment is high in India, pushing the nation to deepen ties with Russia and China. Indian Prime Minister Modi recently met with Putin and Xi, signaling alternative partnerships amid economic shocks. Resolving the tariff dispute and broader trade disagreements will likely require direct communication between Trump and Modi. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moroccan feminist and LGBTQ+ activist Ibtissame Lachgar has been sentenced to 30 months in prison and fined for blasphemy, her lawyer confirmed. Lachgar was found guilty of violating Morocco's criminal code after posting a picture online wearing a T-shirt with the phrase "Allah is lesbian" in Arabic. Her defense team argued the message was political and fell under freedom of expression, asserting there was no intent to offend Islam. This sentencing has reignited debates about human rights and freedom of speech in Morocco, with her legal team planning to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>President Trump's unprecedented firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, hours after a disappointing July jobs report, has raised significant concerns among economists about the politicization of economic data. The BLS, responsible for crucial economic statistics like the unemployment rate and CPI, faces questions about its future under Trump's nominated replacement, EJ Antoni, a vocal critic of the agency. While the bureau's day-to-day operations remain largely unchanged, critics fear that publicly questioning its data undermines public trust and could lead to a confused understanding of the economy.

          <p>Figma shares plummeted nearly 20% on Thursday, falling to their lowest price since the design software vendor's IPO in July, following its first public earnings report. Although second-quarter revenue slightly exceeded analyst estimates at $249.6 million, the results were largely in line with preliminary figures released over a month ago. Analysts at Piper Sandler described the report as "largely a non-event," but noted the stock's "hyper-volatility" after its initial 250% surge.

          <p>President Trump has requested a fast-track Supreme Court ruling to uphold his broad power to impose worldwide tariffs, despite losing in lower courts. His legal team believes the conservative-majority court, known for its views on strong presidential power, particularly in foreign policy and national security, may rule in his favor. The appeal argues that delaying a decision until June 26 could cause significant economic disruption if $750 billion-$1 trillion in tariffs have already been collected. Lower courts have ruled Trump exceeded his legal authority, citing constitutional limits on presidential tariff powers. (not investment advice)</p>

The author reflects on personal ambivalence towards attending, contrasting it with her mother's positive experience of rekindled romance. Sociologists view reunions as "autobiographical occasions" for self-construction and comparison, a function that social media's algorithmic changes have made less accessible. Ultimately, reunions offer a unique opportunity to gauge personal growth, release past versions of oneself, and strengthen long-standing friendships, proving their unsinkable place in the social calendar.</p>
