          <p>Controversial changes to the statutes of Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, have been approved despite criticism from Austria's national motoring club, OAMTC. The OAMTC warned that the changes, proposed by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, risk further eroding the FIA's reputation for competent and transparent governance. Despite concerns about the changes potentially reducing the independence of oversight bodies, members voted for the amendments with a significant majority. The OAMTC hinted at a potential legal challenge, alleging that the changes were endorsed by improperly constituted world council meetings.</p>

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to rising electricity demand and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S., once a leader in uranium mining, now imports over 95% of its uranium feedstock. With electricity demand skyrocketing, experts estimate that known uranium deposits will run out by 2080. The U.S. government has provided bipartisan support, including banning Russian uranium imports and unlocking federal funding to expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity, but even with this support, the U.S. will continue to depend on other countries for uranium.</p>
