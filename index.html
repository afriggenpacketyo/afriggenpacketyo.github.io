          <p>A venture capitalist, Carles Reina, explains his decision to invest in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after a brief meeting with its co-founder. Reina, then at Concept Ventures, recognized the potential in voice AI before it became mainstream, seeing an opportunity where other investors hesitated. ElevenLabs, specializing in text-to-speech and voice cloning, has since achieved a $3.3 billion valuation and plans global expansion, including an IPO within five years.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered an 11-4 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, prompting speculation that a week-long layoff might have affected their performance. After sweeping the National League Championship Series, the Dodgers had their longest break since February. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan struggled, leading some to suggest that being 'too fresh' could alter pitch movement. Manager Dave Roberts dismissed the layoff as an excuse, but historical data shows teams with similar breaks often lose the World Series.</p>

          <p>Police are actively searching for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national and asylum seeker, who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford despite being jailed for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and another woman.

Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed outrage, and politicians, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, have condemned the error.

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei's radical austerity policies, which have led to a significant drop in inflation and a budget surplus, are facing increasing political challenges. Critics, including former party members, argue that the economic 'shock therapy' has ignored the needs of the middle class and vulnerable groups, causing widespread hardship. As the country prepares for parliamentary elections, Milei's approval ratings have declined, and his campaign is grappling with corruption scandals involving close associates. The election outcome will be crucial for his ability to govern and implement further reforms.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of 'fabricating a war' after the US deployed the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier towards the Caribbean. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the world's largest warship to the region, escalating the US military build-up, which Washington claims targets drug traffickers. Maduro views these actions as an intimidation campaign aimed at destabilizing his government.

This partnership allows the airlines to coordinate scheduling, pricing, and capacity for US-Mexico flights. The Department of Transportation mandated an end to the nearly nine-year-old venture by January 1, citing competition concerns in US-Mexico City markets. Both airlines argue the order is arbitrary, will cause substantial financial losses and operational disruptions, and holds their venture to an unfair standard compared to others.</p>
