          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that the next phase of the peace agreement requires Hamas to completely disarm and demilitarize the Gaza Strip. He expressed hope for a peaceful resolution but referenced President Trump's warning that "all hell breaks loose" if Hamas fails to comply. The statement follows the successful return of living Israeli hostages as part of a U.S.-brokered deal aimed at ending the two-year conflict and ensuring no weapons are smuggled into or produced within Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he might ask FIFA to move the 2026 World Cup games scheduled for Boston if he deems the city unsafe under Mayor Michelle Wu's leadership. Citing a recent violent street takeover targeting police, Trump asserted he would not hesitate to contact FIFA President Gianni Infantino to relocate the matches to a safer city. The president also extended this warning to Los Angeles regarding the 2028 Summer Olympics if he feels the city is unprepared to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>Samuel Lee Smithers, 72, was executed in Florida for the 1996 murders of Christy Cowan and Denise Roach. Smithers was convicted of beating and strangling the two women, whose bodies were discovered in a pond on a property where he worked as a landscaper. His execution marks the 14th in the state this year, a record number since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The U.S. Supreme Court denied his final appeal, which argued his age should make him ineligible for execution.</p>

          <p>The Republic of Ireland achieved a crucial 1-0 victory against Armenia in a World Cup qualifier, with the turning point being a red card for Armenian captain Tigran Barseghyan. Barseghyan was dismissed early in the second half for headbutting Irish midfielder Finn Azaz during a heated moment. Playing with a one-man advantage, Ireland capitalized with a winning goal from Evan Ferguson, keeping their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup alive as they navigate a delicately poised group.</p>

          <p>As part of the ongoing U.S.-brokered peace agreement, Hamas has returned the remains of four more deceased Israeli hostages. The coffins were transferred to the Red Cross before being handed over to Israeli authorities for forensic identification and notification of the families. This follows the return of four other sets of remains a day earlier, though Israel states that 20 bodies are still unaccounted for. The gradual return of deceased hostages is a critical, though contentious, component of the fragile ceasefire deal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is considering a ban on cooking oil imports from China in response to Beijing's refusal to purchase U.S. soybeans. Characterizing China's move as an "Economically Hostile Act," Trump stated that retaliation is necessary to support American soybean farmers affected by the trade dispute. The threat adds to the volatility of U.S.-China trade relations, which have seen escalating tariffs and export controls, causing significant fluctuations in the stock market.

          <p>A JPMorgan survey highlights a significant "K-shaped" divergence in how Americans perceive the economy, largely split along income lines. High-income consumers reported much stronger economic confidence, rating their outlook a 6.2 out of 10, while low-income earners averaged a 4.4. This disparity is also reflected in their ability to cover monthly bills and plans for discretionary spending. The data suggests that wealthier Americans are weathering inflationary pressures far better than lower earners, who continue to struggle with the rising cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another strike on a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people who President Donald Trump claimed were "narcoterrorists." This marks the fifth such operation since September, bringing the total reported death toll to 27. The Trump administration has justified the strikes as self-defense within a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels, a legal framing that has drawn criticism and condemnation from neighboring countries and some international law experts.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a significant slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, reinforcing expectations that the central bank may implement two more interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to economists, Powell noted that while inflation remains a concern, the "rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment." This suggests the Fed is becoming more worried about the job market than about prices, signaling a potential shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>
