          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged past $100,000 for the first time since February, fueled by optimism surrounding the U.S.-UK trade deal announcement. The cryptocurrency's rise began overnight, coinciding with Trump's announcement of the trade agreement. Analysts suggest Bitcoin's resurgence reaffirms its status as a resilient asset amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Despite not yet surpassing January's high, the rebound indicates potential for further gains, with buying from long-term holders offsetting selling pressure from short-term investors.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates, suggesting it would act as 'jet fuel' for the markets. Trump claims Powell's reluctance stems from personal feelings rather than economic considerations. This criticism follows the Fed's decision to maintain current interest rates, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump believes lower rates would counter a potential economic slowdown, contrasting with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which have both lowered their borrowing rates. Powell maintains that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the pursuit of maximum employment and price stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since implementing 'reciprocal' tariffs. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports and reduce non-tariff barriers. While specifics were not fully detailed, both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed optimism, noting the agreement is still being finalized. The deal suggests a baseline tariff of 10% on UK goods entering the U.S., while UK duties on U.S. goods will decrease to between 1.8% and 5.1%.</p>

          <p>A woman in the UK has been acquitted of having an illegal abortion after a jury found her not guilty. The woman, Nicola Packer, took abortion medicine at home when she was approximately 26 weeks pregnant, which is beyond the legal limit for at-home abortions. Packer claimed she was unaware of how far along she was in her pregnancy and expressed shock at the situation. The case raised questions about access to abortion services during the coronavirus lockdown and the legal limits for terminating a pregnancy.</p>

Witnesses reported hearing Mahdi cry out and groan after the shots were fired, which supports the claim of a botched execution. Mahdi was executed for the 2004 murder of a police officer.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that 28 major U.S. cities are sinking, posing a threat to the structural integrity of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. The study, which used satellite-based radar measurements, attributes the sinking to groundwater extraction. Cities like Houston, New York, and San Francisco are experiencing significant subsidence, which can lead to compromised structural integrity and heightened flood risks. Researchers emphasize that the damage may only become evident when it is severe or potentially catastrophic, exacerbated by extreme weather amplified by climate change.</p>

Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as liquidation bankruptcy, offers the most comprehensive debt relief by eliminating many unsecured debts, but it is income-based and has limitations. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves a structured repayment plan over three to five years, suitable for those with higher incomes or wanting to protect more assets.

The decision was influenced by concerns that the global trade war could hit UK economic growth, although a UK-US trade deal was welcomed.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the challenges Republican lawmakers face as they consider legislation to cut popular programs like Medicaid to fund President Trump's agenda. Representative Gabe Evans, from a swing district in Colorado, is on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is tasked with slashing Medicaid spending by $880 billion over the next decade. These cuts could affect a significant number of Medicaid recipients in his district, creating a difficult political situation. Republicans struggle to unite around Trump's domestic agenda, highlighting the challenges of balancing fiscal responsibility with constituent needs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates steady, labeling him a 'fool' for acting 'too late' in cutting the central bank's benchmark rate. Trump inaccurately claimed there is 'virtually NO INFLATION,' despite inflation rising 2.4% annually in March. Powell has stressed the Federal Reserve's independence, making decisions based on economic data rather than political pressure. Some analysts suggest Trump's pressure could backfire, forcing Powell to move cautiously to avoid appearing influenced by the President.</p>
