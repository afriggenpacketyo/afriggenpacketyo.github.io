          <p>NHS England plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade to alleviate pressure on accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, offering specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England believes this pioneering model of care will ensure people receive appropriate support in the right setting, while reducing overcrowding in hospitals. However, some experts remain skeptical, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing of the model before national implementation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the recapture of a New Orleans jail escapee has sparked debate over privacy and civil liberties. Despite the police department's recent pause on automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., the technology was used to locate fugitives, raising concerns about unchecked surveillance. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, argue that live facial recognition poses a threat to fundamental rights and is racially biased. Project N.O.L.A. operates around 200 facial recognition cameras in New Orleans, scanning faces, clothing, and license plates, raising questions about accountability and data collection on ordinary citizens.</p>

          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna placement during construction of a new control tower. The FAA ordered the aborted landings out of caution, raising concerns about close calls between government helicopters and commercial planes. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to address safety issues, while the NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media rather than directly to the agency.</p>

          <p>David Ha, CEO of Sakana AI K.K., a Japanese AI startup backed by Nvidia, is urging the Japanese government to prioritize developing its own AI technology for defense. He argues that Japan's increasingly severe security environment and the potential for AI to become a bargaining chip in a deglobalized world necessitate a focus on domestic AI capabilities. Sakana AI, which secured an award at a defense innovation competition, sees growth potential in collaborating with the Japanese government on defense-related AI solutions.

          <p>Ahead of the UK's ban on disposable vapes on June 1, many vapers are stockpiling the devices, fearing the loss of convenience and taste. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, but some ex-smokers worry about returning to cigarettes. Retailers have seen sales of disposable vapes surge as customers stock up, while concerns arise about the availability of preferred flavors and the potential for a black market. The government hopes the ban will encourage the use of rechargeable vapes, but some argue it will negatively impact public health by removing an effective smoking cessation tool.</p>

          <p>All six people aboard a small plane died after it crashed into a San Diego neighborhood. Investigators are looking into whether foggy weather and technical issues at the airport, including runway lights being out and a weather alert system not working, contributed to the crash. The pilot acknowledged the weather conditions were not ideal but decided to proceed with the landing. The plane clipped power lines before crashing, damaging nearby homes and vehicles. Among the victims were music agent Dave Shapiro and former drummer for The Devil Wears Prada, Daniel Williams.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit a mega-project to construct a 767-kilometer canal connecting the inland province of Jiangxi to the coastal province of Zhejiang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, estimated to cost $44.4 billion, is intended to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. Upon completion, the canal is expected to accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, facilitating trade between the resource-rich Jiangxi province and the seaports in Zhejiang.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented stricter press access restrictions inside the Pentagon, citing concerns about leaks of classified and unclassified information. The new rules confine credentialed reporters to a limited area and require escorts for movement within the building. The Pentagon Press Association criticized the measures as an attack on the freedom of the press, questioning their effectiveness in preventing leaks. The restrictions follow an investigation into multiple disclosures, including alleged classified information, and the firing of several top aides.</p>

This move comes amid rising criticism over the government's failure to curb spiking rice prices, which have reached record levels, impacting households already struggling with inflation.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to send hundreds of border agents to various parts of the country to assist ICE in arresting unauthorized immigrants within the U.S. The plan involves approximately 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Border Patrol agents and members of specialized units. These CBP agents will support ICE's efforts to target immigrants in the country illegally, marking an escalation in the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The effort underscores the administration's focus on interior enforcement operations, even amid a historic drop in illegal border crossings.</p>
