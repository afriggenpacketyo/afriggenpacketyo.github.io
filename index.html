          <p>Hurricane Erin has regained Category 4 strength in the Atlantic, prompting forecasters to warn of "life-threatening surf and rip currents" along the U.S. East Coast this week. Although the storm's core is expected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. without making direct landfall, its large size means its effects will be felt from a distance. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 intensity, is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, causing fluctuations in its power but ensuring it remains a dangerous major hurricane for several days. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos and parts of the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>Shares in Novo Nordisk saw a nearly 5% increase after its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a serious liver disease. The drug is now authorized for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. This approval marks a significant expansion of Wegovy's applications beyond weight loss and diabetes, positioning it as the first GLP-1 class treatment for this widespread liver condition. The decision was based on trial data showing Wegovy significantly improved liver fibrosis compared to a placebo.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with President Trump at the White House, accompanied by several key European leaders, including the heads of the European Commission and NATO. Their presence is seen as an effort to form a united front and prevent Trump from pressuring Ukraine into an unfavorable peace agreement with Russia. The talks are focused on major issues such as potential territorial concessions, which Zelenskyy opposes, and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine. This high-stakes meeting follows Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin, after which Trump's stance on the war appeared to shift.</p>

          <p>Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund has decided to partially divest from several Israeli companies, citing ethical concerns over the ongoing war in Gaza. The move adds momentum to the global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which has seen increased activity since the conflict escalated. While Israeli officials have remained quiet, some analysts believe the decision could set a dangerous precedent, potentially encouraging other international entities to apply similar financial pressure. Despite this, foreign investment in Israel has shown resilience, rebounding significantly in the past year.</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is facing a crucial by-election in a rural Alberta riding as he seeks to regain a seat in the House of Commons. Having lost his long-held Ottawa-area constituency in the last general election, this race is a significant test of his leadership ahead of a mandatory party review in January. His victory margin in the Conservative stronghold will be closely scrutinized as a measure of his political strength against the new Liberal government led by Prime Minister Mark Carney. The election is also complicated by a record number of protest candidates on the ballot.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a crucial White House meeting, President Donald Trump asserted on social media that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end the war with Russia "almost immediately." This statement follows Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, after which his stance shifted to favor a comprehensive peace deal over a ceasefire, aligning more with Russia's position. Trump also reiterated that Ukraine will not be permitted to join NATO and should not expect to regain Crimea, escalating pressure on Kyiv to accept significant territorial concessions to secure peace.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's assertions that its aggressive tariff policies will spark a U.S. manufacturing renaissance, many economists are skeptical of this claim. Experts interviewed in the article point to the erratic and inconsistent nature of the tariffs, their questionable legality, and the increased production costs for American companies as major obstacles. They argue that broad, unfocused tariffs are less effective than targeted industrial policies and may ultimately reduce the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, leading to job losses rather than gains.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is heading toward its first-ever presidential runoff election, a result that signals the end of more than two decades of left-wing political dominance in the Andean nation. In a surprise outcome, centrist candidate Sen. Rodrigo Paz secured the most votes but not enough for an outright victory, and will now face right-wing former President Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga in a second round. The vote represents a major blow to the ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party, which has fractured amid a severe economic crisis that has soured public opinion.</p>
