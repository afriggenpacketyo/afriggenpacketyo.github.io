            <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated his hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine within the week, suggesting it would lead to lucrative business opportunities with the United States. This statement follows recent calls for compromise from both Kyiv and Moscow. However, both sides have accused each other of violating a brief Easter ceasefire, raising doubts about the feasibility of an imminent agreement. Trump's optimism comes amidst ongoing conflict and accusations of broken truces, highlighting the complexities of achieving a lasting resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With mortgage rates expected to decline, first-time home buyers are exploring various strategies to enter the housing market. These include maximizing Lifetime ISA bonuses, considering low-deposit mortgages (some offering up to 99% loan-to-value), exploring shared ownership schemes, and utilizing "income boost" mortgages where family members can support borrowing without owning the property. Experts emphasize the importance of early saving and careful consideration of eligibility criteria for different mortgage products. These strategies aim to overcome deposit hurdles and affordability challenges faced by first-time buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 20:17:45 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent study highlights that men visit doctors less frequently than women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become severe. This reluctance stems from societal pressures to "tough it out," fears of appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't accommodate their work schedules. The study also indicates that men prefer to self-manage health issues, viewing healthcare as a treatment rather than prevention. Experts suggest redesigning services to meet men's needs, focusing on action-oriented approaches and addressing concerns about vulnerability. </p>

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni shrine, a controversial symbol of Japan's past militarism, during its spring festival. Ishiba is unlikely to visit the shrine due to diplomatic concerns. In other news, Ishiba stated that security issues will not be included in trade talks with the United States, despite President Trump's calls for reduced U.S. defense burdens. Additionally, train services in central Tokyo resumed after a suspension affecting 550,000 people due to track-switching work for improved airport access.</p>

The research aims to understand how seawater mixing with magma affects explosivity and to create geohazard maps for emergency planning. Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but recent seismic activity has highlighted the need to understand the volcano's potential for destructive events. The findings will inform local residents and tourists about hazardous areas and improve preparedness for future crises.</p>

            <p>San Jose, California, is contemplating arresting unhoused individuals who repeatedly refuse offers of shelter, following a warning or citation. Mayor Matt Mahan proposes this as a last resort, citing challenges in encouraging unhoused people to accept available shelter spaces. The city operates tiny homes, converted motels, and parking lots as temporary housing, but many individuals with chronic homelessness, behavioral health issues, or addiction resist assistance. The aim is to bring vulnerable individuals indoors, provide them with necessary support, and address the impacts of long-term encampments on the community.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan has sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a controversial site viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. This action coincides with the shrine's three-day spring festival. However, Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine in person, likely due to diplomatic considerations as Japan aims to improve relations with China and South Korea. The shrine honors wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals, alongside millions of war dead.</p>

            <p>Professor Yan Anlin, a Taiwan studies expert and advisor to Beijing, suggests that complete reunification between mainland China and Taiwan is likely to take another five to ten years.

However, he acknowledges that extreme actions by Taiwanese independence advocates could accelerate the timeline, potentially making peaceful reunification unfeasible.
