          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled against a Biden-era program, eliminating temporary humanitarian protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants, creating uncertainty about their future. The ruling's immediate impact is unclear, especially concerning the speed at which deportations could occur. This decision marks a significant setback for the administration's immigration policies and adds to the ongoing debate surrounding migrant rights and border security. The legal challenges and policy shifts continue to shape the landscape for migrants in the United States.</p>

          <p>Following a knife attack in Hamburg, where a Syrian teenager named Muhammad al-Muhammad helped stop the assailant, manipulated images of him have been circulating online, fueling right-wing narratives. These images, some AI-generated, aim to discredit al-Muhammad's heroism and undermine trust in the media. Media expert Una Titz notes that such disinformation fosters distrust and insecurity, creating alternative realities that challenge factual reporting. The Hamburg police confirmed al-Muhammad's involvement, emphasizing the importance of protecting individuals' privacy in police reports.</p>

          <p>CPAC, the US Conservative Political Action Conference, held gatherings in Poland and Hungary, signaling an effort by US-backed conservatives to gain mainstream influence in Europe. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban envisions a new Europe based on the nation, traditional family, and his version of Christianity, and he described President Trump as a "truth serum." Speakers at the CPAC events criticized the EU's Green Deal, immigration, and "gender and woke madness." While the MAGA movement seeks to reshape Europe, it has faced setbacks in recent elections, and Orban's message may be losing its appeal in Hungary.</p>

Recent explosions in Ukraine's Kherson region and Russia's Kursk region have further strained relations.

          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice becoming available to consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice at a lower price of 2,160 yen for a 5 kilogram-bag. The initiative aims to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on households. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes that this direct selling approach will be more effective in curbing rice prices compared to previous auction methods.</p>

Silva was publicly belittled by senators pushing for economic projects that her ministry is scrutinizing. Lula's support for oil exploration in the Foz do Amazonas and a bill stripping environmental licensing powers from Silva's ministry have weakened her position. Despite public defense of Silva, Lula's actions reflect the contradictions in his environmental promises and his dependence on a broad coalition with ties to agribusiness and mining.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 3.5% tax on remittances made by non-US citizens could significantly impact African economies, where these financial transfers often outweigh aid and foreign direct investment. Remittances are a crucial source of income for many lower-income families in Africa, used for essential expenses like food, education, and medical care. Experts predict that migrants may turn to unofficial channels to evade the tax, reducing transparency and potentially harming those most reliant on these funds. The US is the largest origin country for remittances, and this tax is viewed as part of the administration's campaign against illegal migration.</p>

          <p>An inquiry into the Bondi mass killing in Australia is examining how Joel Cauchi, a 40-year-old man with a history of mental illness, was able to fatally stab six people and injure several others at a Sydney shopping center. The inquest is scrutinizing Cauchi's interactions with police and mental health professionals, highlighting missed opportunities for intervention. The inquiry is also investigating whether Cauchi targeted specific individuals or groups, particularly women, and is expected to deliver recommendations by the end of the year to prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>
