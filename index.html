          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" delves into the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity. The collection highlights his evolution into an expressive ballad singer, influenced by his personal struggles, and showcases his collaboration with the TCB Band. This release offers a poignant look at a period of artistic potential just before his career declined, following a missed opportunity to star in "A Star Is Born," a disappointment friends believe contributed to his tragic end.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the Atlantic's first hurricane of the season, reaching Category 5 strength with winds of 160 mph. While the storm is expected to remain offshore, tracking between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, it poses a significant threat of large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20 to 27. Tropical storm watches are in effect for several Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico could experience heavy rain and potential flooding, though a cold front is anticipated to keep the hurricane's core away from the mainland.</p>

          <p>The governor of West Virginia has announced the deployment of 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington, D.C., to support the Trump administration's federal crackdown on crime. This move follows a presidential executive order that federalized local police and activated the D.C. National Guard, tightening federal control over the city. The intervention, justified by the administration as a response to a public order emergency, has been met with protests and criticism from local officials who argue it undermines the district's limited self-governance.</p>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This resurgence is largely attributed to the growing popularity and innovation of Samsung's foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. By providing a wider range of devices at various price points, Samsung is effectively competing on both the low and high ends of the market, prompting speculation that Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is under attack by political and corporate interests, threatening decades of progress in wildlife conservation. While the act successfully saved species like the northern elephant seal from extinction, many marine mammals now face new dangers from climate change, pollution, and ship strikes. The author contends that weakening these protections is misguided, as the declining health of whale and dolphin populations serves as a critical indicator of broader oceanic distress that ultimately affects human well-being.</p>

          <h2>Cardiologists Recommend Eating More Salmon for Heart Health, Especially After Age 60</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals over 60, cardiologists strongly recommend incorporating salmon into their diet to support cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. As the heart is a muscle, consuming adequate protein is crucial for maintaining its strength with age. Experts suggest eating at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with plans to reopen standalone stores on the British High Street for the first time since its collapse in 2020. After hosting its first catwalk show in seven years, the brand aims to appeal to both its original millennial followers and a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high, its success will depend on its ability to reclaim its "cool" factor and compete in a challenging retail environment dominated by fast fashion and different consumer priorities.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his valor during a 1944 mission where, despite suffering 72 injuries, he piloted his flying boat to successfully destroy a German U-boat. After the war, he had a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his heroic actions simply as his duty. He was remembered by friends as a private, stoic, and charitable man.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people in the southern Syrian city of Sweida demonstrated for the right to self-determination for the country's Druze minority. The protest follows deadly sectarian clashes in July between Druze militias and armed Bedouin Sunni tribes, in which the Syrian government intervened. Druze groups have accused Damascus of siding against them and committing atrocities during the violence, which killed around 1,600 people. The protests mark a significant shift, with activists noting it is the first time the slogan of self-determination has been used so prominently.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the plight of abducted Ukrainian children. The letter reportedly raised concerns about the thousands of children who have been forcibly transferred from occupied Ukrainian territories to Russia, an act considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court. Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's gesture, highlighting it as an act of humanism that brings attention to the ongoing tragedy.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week with gains and reached several new record highs, driven by investor optimism following favorable inflation data. Tuesday's Consumer Price Index report, which showed inflation cooling more than expected, increased market speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. While a subsequent report on wholesale inflation was higher than anticipated, it did not significantly dampen expectations for a rate cut, keeping market sentiment positive throughout the week.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to apply greater scrutiny when evaluating the "good moral character" requirement for immigrants seeking citizenship. The new policy mandates a "holistic assessment" that goes beyond a simple criminal background check, considering factors like community involvement and adherence to societal norms. Critics argue this move is designed to create more grounds for denial based on subjective criteria, such as traffic infractions, and to discourage legal immigrants from applying for naturalization.</p>
