          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that leaders from the "coalition of the willing," including officials from Germany, France, and Britain, would convene in Kyiv. The meeting aims to address European security concerns and discuss ongoing support for Ukraine following a potential ceasefire with Russia. The United States is not participating in this coalition, although former President Trump has advocated for a ceasefire agreement between Kyiv and Moscow. The coalition seeks to bolster Ukraine's defenses and deter future Russian aggression, as well as increase sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Mexico has initiated legal action against Google after the tech giant altered the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, aligning with former U.S. President Trump's executive order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized Google's action as an infringement on Mexico and Cuba's continental shelf, arguing that Trump's decree only applies within U.S. territory. Google's policy is to reflect official local names, leading to discrepancies in the label across different countries. The lawsuit follows the House Republicans' passage of the Gulf of America Act, aiming to codify Trump's order, and seeks to reverse Google's name change.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in the UK, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing net migration. The proposed changes include stricter requirements for employers to demonstrate investment in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, with a focus on the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa applications from countries with high rates of overstaying and asylum claims, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, are likely to face increased scrutiny. The white paper is also expected to address the "right to family life" under the European Convention on Human Rights, potentially leading to a more defined legal framework.</p>

          <p>The New York Times published records detailing key moments in the federal corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, revealing a nearly four-year inquiry into his dealings. The documents, including search warrants and sworn statements, highlight the investigation's focus on Adams's fundraising and connections to the Turkish government. Federal agents considered seizing Adams's electronic devices at the New York City Marathon but ultimately approached him later. The case was dismissed after the Trump administration intervened, leading to accusations of a corrupt quid pro quo, which Adams denies.</p>

The agreement aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs imposed by former U.S. President Trump on certain UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions about the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) occurred during negotiations, Lord Mandelson clarified that abolishing the tax was not part of the deal.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are meeting with Chinese officials in Geneva to address the escalating trade dispute between the two countries. The goal is to de-escalate tensions and potentially reduce the tariffs both nations have imposed on each other's goods, which currently stand at 145% for the U.S. and 125% for China. While prospects for a major breakthrough are uncertain, even a small reduction in tariffs could provide relief to global financial markets and companies reliant on U.S.-China trade. The meetings occur amid concerns over trade deficits and China's technology policies, including alleged unfair practices related to intellectual property and subsidies.</p>

Economists estimate the change could lead to $10.9 billion in new costs, disproportionately affecting lower-income households.

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing job cuts as part of the DOGE initiative, aiming to reduce the agency's workforce by 15%, leading to concerns about the impact on veteran healthcare. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins insists that frontline healthcare services will not be affected, but critics question how the VA can return to its 2019 size without impacting care. VA staff and veterans are worried about potential shortages of medical providers and the quality of services. The article highlights the debate over the workforce reduction and its potential consequences for veterans' benefits and healthcare.</p>

          <p>Hainan, a duty-free island province off China’s southern coast, is aiming to attract more Chinese shoppers amid the ongoing trade war with the United States. As China considers entering trade negotiations with the United States, Hainan is poised to launch its own separate customs regime, enabling it to bypass the 125% retaliatory tariffs Beijing has imposed on American imports. The hope is that the promise of cheap iPhones and US cosmetics could help drive a surge in visitors to the island’s duty-free stores, which have struggled over the past two years amid sluggish domestic consumption and a recovery in overseas tourism.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, a move seen as a symbolic stand against Beijing’s growing military pressure. The decision to formally observe the end of the war in Europe was met with criticism at home, with analysts and opposition lawmakers accusing Lai of distorting history by sidestepping Japan’s wartime atrocities and minimizing the role of the Republic of China in the Allied victory. In his speech, Lai described peace as “priceless” and urged democratic countries to unite against modern authoritarian threats.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lift the 25 percent tariff on steel exported from the UK to the United States has provided some relief for struggling British steel businesses. Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, a major steel-making facility, anticipates increased demand from U.S. customers following the tariff removal. However, uncertainties remain regarding products processed in the European Union before being shipped to the United States. The UK steel industry has faced challenges such as weak demand, competition, and high energy costs, making the tariff relief a welcome development for the sector.</p>

          <p>The intensifying trade war between the United States and China has prompted Chinese companies to relocate manufacturing operations to Vietnam to evade tariffs. Factories producing various goods, from clothing to sporting equipment, are rapidly shifting production to Vietnam, with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein facilitating the transition. While Vietnam offers a cost-effective alternative due to its shared border and low labor costs, challenges remain, including potential scrutiny from U.S. officials concerned about tariff circumvention.

          <p>A judge has temporarily restrained the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at numerous federal agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that federal employee unions are likely to prove that the administration's efforts to reorganize and downsize the government exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. The ruling underscores the legal challenges faced by the administration's cost-cutting drive.</p>
