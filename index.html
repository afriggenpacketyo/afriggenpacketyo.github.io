            <p>A Connecticut man, identified only as 'S,' has released his first public statement after claiming to have been held captive by his stepmother for two decades, beginning at age 11. 'S' stated that he is choosing a new name to reclaim control over his life and future, considering this his first act of freedom. He expressed gratitude to healthcare professionals, first responders, law enforcement, and Safe Haven Waterbury for their support since his escape, which involved setting a fire. Police have released disturbing photos of the home's interior, while his stepmother faces charges of kidnapping and felony assault, to which she has pleaded not guilty.</p>

            <p>United Airlines has maintained its full-year profit forecast but also provided a second outlook accounting for a potential recession, citing the 'impossible' economic climate to predict. The airline expects adjusted earnings per share between $11.50 and $13.50 in a stable economy, but between $7 and $9 in a recession. United plans to cut domestic flights due to disappointing demand while international bookings remain strong. The company reported a first-quarter profit of $387 million, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong international travel and premium-cabin bookings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered expedited discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador. This comes after the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the government must 'facilitate' his return. The judge emphasized the irreparable harm Abrego Garcia faces each day he remains imprisoned in El Salvador. The Justice Department argued that discovery is inappropriate, claiming the issue is a legal dispute. The judge plans to issue a written order clarifying the definition of 'facilitate,' with depositions to be completed by April 23.</p>

            <p>Vox analyzes President Trump's authoritarian tendencies, comparing his approach to those of strongmen like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele and Hungary's Viktor Orbán. The article argues that Trump's mix of showy displays of might and subtle legal manipulations could backfire, inflaming resistance to his policies. Trump's actions regarding immigration and his efforts to influence universities are cited as examples of his authoritarian leanings. The analysis suggests that Trump's strategic sloppiness may ultimately undermine his goals.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children, or over 3%, have been identified with autism. This marks a significant increase compared to previous generations, prompting discussions about improved screening and access to autism services. While the study highlights the rise in diagnoses, some, like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., suggest it indicates a growing 'epidemic' of autism, which has been criticized by experts. The CDC also noted disparities in autism prevalence among different racial and ethnic groups.</p>
