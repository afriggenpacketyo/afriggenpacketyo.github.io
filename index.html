          <p>The human toll of the catastrophic Texas floods is becoming clearer as victims are identified, including numerous young campers, counselors, teachers, and entire families. The article provides personal stories behind the staggering death toll, focusing on the tragedy at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, where at least 27 girls and staff members perished. Relatives and community members have begun sharing memories of those lost in the deluge, which authorities say has claimed over 100 lives in total across the region.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have voted overwhelmingly to approve further strike action, continuing a long-running dispute with the government over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that despite recent pay rises, wages are still significantly lower in real terms compared to 2008 and is demanding full "pay restoration." The government expressed disappointment, highlighting the potential for major disruptions to the National Health Service and efforts to reduce patient waiting lists if further walkouts occur.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travelers at some U.S. airports are no longer required to remove their shoes during standard security screenings, a significant change to a post-9/11 travel rule. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly allowed the requirement to expire in a phased approach, with airports in Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and others being among the first to implement the change. The "no-shoes" rule was officially adopted nationwide in 2006, years after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001, and its removal marks a major shift in airport security procedures.</p>

          <p>The UK's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has reported that the cost of the state pension triple lock is expected to be three times higher than initially estimated by 2030. The triple lock policy guarantees the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR's report highlights the increasing strain on public finances, noting that the UK's financial position is "relatively vulnerable" due to rising pension costs and recent government spending decisions.

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the IRS has indicated it will not enforce the Johnson Amendment against churches whose pastors endorse political candidates during religious services. This move came in a joint court filing with the National Religious Broadcasters Association, which had sued the agency. The 1954 Johnson Amendment prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from engaging in political campaigning, but the IRS now suggests this should not apply to communications within a house of worship, potentially increasing political speech in religious settings.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has reportedly instructed the military to draft a plan to move all 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza to a single large camp in the south of the territory. The proposal involves establishing a "humanitarian city" on the ruins of Rafah, where residents would be held after security screening and not permitted to leave. The plan has drawn immediate condemnation from a human rights lawyer, who described it as a blueprint for a "crime against humanity" and a precursor to deportation.</p>

          <p>Despite its focus on spending cuts, President Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" includes a surprising $16 billion investment in federal child care tax credits, a policy area traditionally championed by Democrats. The article credits first-term Republican Senator Katie Britt with spearheading the effort, leveraging a politically volatile moment around IVF access to build a pro-family platform. By framing child care as a political imperative for the GOP, she successfully lobbied for expansions to tax credits for working parents and businesses that provide care assistance.</p>

          <p>In a notable policy update, President Donald Trump announced that the United States will send more weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression. The statement comes amid reports of Trump's growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's unwillingness to end the war. This move follows a period where the administration had scaled back aid provided under the previous presidency, suggesting a potential shift in strategy as the conflict continues with intense Russian attacks.</p>

          <p>A Berlin administrative court has ruled that the German government must issue visas to an Afghan woman and her 13 family members, upholding a previous promise made under a program for those at risk from the Taliban. The family, currently in Pakistan and facing deportation, had been given a "legally binding" commitment for admission to Germany. The court determined this commitment overrides the current government's decision to halt the special admission scheme, reinforcing the state's obligation to those it had pledged to protect.</p>

          <p>The United States is facing a significant depletion of its Patriot missile interceptor stockpiles, possessing only about 25% of the munitions required for the Pentagon's global military plans. This shortage, exacerbated by recent use in the Middle East and transfers to allies, reportedly led the Trump administration to temporarily freeze a shipment to Ukraine. The situation highlights a critical strain on the U.S. defense industrial base's ability to quickly replenish essential weapons systems amid ongoing international conflicts and strategic demands.</p>

The National Weather Service attributes the heat to a high-pressure system expanding from Arizona, which is "squashing" the cooling marine layer and increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses.</p>
