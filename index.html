          <p>South Sudan's government has repatriated a Mexican citizen, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, who was deported from the United States to the East African nation in July. This action is part of a controversial Trump administration policy of deporting migrants, including those with serious criminal convictions, to third-party countries. The move has drawn criticism from rights groups who argue it violates international law, though the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the practice to continue. The repatriation was coordinated between South Sudan's foreign ministry and the Mexican Embassy in Ethiopia.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal funicular crash in Lisbon has determined that a snapped cable was the cause of the derailment. The incident, involving the city's historic 140-year-old Glória funicular, resulted in the deaths of sixteen people and injured approximately twenty others. The victims included Portuguese nationals and tourists from several countries, including Britain, South Korea, and the United States. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro described the event as one of the nation's most significant recent tragedies, prompting a thorough review of the railway's mechanics.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Minnesota has indicted two naturalized U.S. citizens, Benedict Nwana Kuah and Pascal Kikishy Wongbi, for allegedly leading a violent separatist militia in their native Cameroon. The Department of Justice alleges they used their Minnesota homes as a base to finance and direct the Ambazonia Defense Forces (ADF) in carrying out kidnappings, bombings, and killings. The indictment details their roles in raising funds for weapons and ordering attacks on civilians and government officials to advance their goal of creating an independent state. If convicted, both men face a maximum penalty of life in prison.</p>

The operation, described by officials as the largest single-site enforcement action in Homeland Security Investigations history, has created diplomatic tension with South Korea. The South Korean government has expressed deep concern over the arrests, emphasizing the need to protect its nationals and corporate interests. The incident highlights the complexities of the Trump administration's immigration policies and their impact on international business and diplomatic alliances.</p>

          <p>U.S. social media influencer Ethan Guo has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean air base in Antarctica for landing his plane without proper authorization. Guo, who was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research, was accused of providing false flight plan data. A Chilean judge ordered his release on the condition that he pay $30,000 in penalties, donate his raised funds to a childhood cancer foundation, and accept a three-year ban from entering Chile. Guo described his detention as a mundane experience where he was treated well by the Chilean people.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix by setting the fastest lap in Formula 1 history, surpassing a record held by Lewis Hamilton since 2020. Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris broke the previous record, with Verstappen achieving an average speed of 164.466 mph. The new record is attributed to the current cars' lower drag, a recently resurfaced and higher-grip track at Monza, and other track modifications. Despite the achievement, Verstappen expressed cautious optimism about the race, acknowledging the strong race performance typically shown by McLaren throughout the season.</p>

In response, OpenAI has expressed condolences and announced plans to enhance safety features for young users, including age-appropriate behavior rules and parental monitoring tools.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he knows "nothing" about a secret 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, as reported by The New York Times. The report, citing numerous anonymous sources, alleged that Trump approved a mission to plant a surveillance device to intercept communications from Kim Jong-un. The operation was reportedly aborted after the SEALs feared detection and opened fire on a North Korean boat, killing unarmed civilians they mistook for a threat. The Pentagon has declined to comment on the matter, and the alleged mission was never disclosed to Congress.</p>

          <p>A photograph of musician Kid Rock's private jet has drawn criticism online for its perceived tacky artwork and the significant environmental impact of private air travel. The Bombardier Challenger jet, which has been flown frequently in 2024, sparked a debate on Reddit about wealth inequality and climate responsibility. Private jets are a major source of carbon pollution, with studies showing they are disproportionately harmful to the environment compared to commercial flights. Commenters on the post criticized the display of wealth as out of touch and called for greater regulation on the use of private aircraft for non-essential travel.</p>

          <p>Approximately 300 people have been arrested in London during a demonstration protesting the UK government's decision to proscribe the campaign group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. Hundreds gathered in Parliament Square, with many holding signs expressing support for the group, leading to arrests for supporting a banned organization. The government's ban makes membership or support for Palestine Action a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The Metropolitan Police reported that officers faced significant abuse, while protest organizers accused the police of using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has discontinued its security protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a move that followed President Trump's revocation of her Secret Service detail. The decision came after internal complaints that the assignment was diverting officers from their regular crime suppression duties. Mayor Karen Bass had initially directed the LAPD to assist the California Highway Patrol in providing temporary security. The police union criticized the use of city resources to protect a private citizen who could afford her own security, highlighting the political tensions surrounding the issue.</p>

The White House claimed, without providing evidence, that those killed were "narco-terrorists" from the Tren de Aragua criminal group, a claim disputed by security analysts. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the U.S. action as imperialist and announced the activation of a national militia plan. The incident occurs as the U.S. designates Venezuela a "narco-state" and deploys warships to the Caribbean, increasing fears of a potential military intervention.</p>

The deal, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, ends a long-standing conflict between ranchers and environmentalists. The organization will now lead a five-year restoration effort, which recently received $2.7 million in state funding, aimed at removing invasive species and re-establishing native grasslands. The project will controversially use targeted cattle grazing as a primary tool for land management, hoping to create a model for balancing conservation and agriculture.</p>

According to a recent survey, only 17% of U.S. adults use sunscreen daily, a figure experts find concerning. The article stresses the need to apply sunscreen to often-missed areas like eyelids, ears, and lips, and recommends using an SPF of 30 or higher year-round. Consistent daily application is key to preventing long-term skin damage, including skin cancer and premature aging, regardless of the season.</p>

The family has amassed billions in paper wealth from these ventures, particularly through governance tokens for their USD1 stablecoin. This evolution marks a more sophisticated effort to capitalize on the Trump brand within the crypto industry, moving from meme coins to publicly listed companies. (not investment advice)</p>
