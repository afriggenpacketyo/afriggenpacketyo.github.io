        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from King's College London indicates that official statistics in England and Wales have missed over 13,000 heroin and opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022. The discrepancy, which suggests the actual number is over 50% higher than previously reported, is attributed to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) lacking access to detailed coroner and toxicology reports. This significant undercounting raises concerns that government policies and funding for addiction services have been based on inaccurate data, potentially hindering efforts to combat the true scale of the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Khyliuk, one of eight civilians recently freed in a rare prisoner swap, has detailed the brutal conditions he endured during his three-and-a-half-year detention in Russia. Captured in the initial days of the full-scale invasion, Khyliuk was held without charges and subjected to beatings, dog attacks, and starvation. His release highlights the plight of over 16,000 Ukrainian civilians believed to be missing, many of whom are illegally detained in Russia, creating immense challenges for Ukrainian officials seeking their return through non-traditional diplomatic channels.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has declared his intention to sue The New York Times for $15 billion, accusing the newspaper of defamation and libel. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed the publication has been allowed to "freely lie, smear, and defame" him for too long, specifically citing its 2024 endorsement of Kamala Harris. This legal threat follows previous unsuccessful lawsuits by Trump against news organizations, including a $100 million case against the Times that was dismissed in 2023.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for intensified efforts to build a unified national market, framing it as a critical strategy for securing an advantage in global competition and achieving development targets. In an article published in the Communist Party's journal Qiushi, Xi outlined key tasks, prioritizing the reduction of excessive price competition among domestic firms. The directive encourages industry associations to guide companies toward competing on product quality rather than engaging in detrimental price wars, reinforcing a policy direction set earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Despite extensive flooding and heavy rains damaging farmland across India, particularly in Punjab, analysts do not expect a significant long-term impact on the country's inflation. While food prices saw a minor increase in August, factors like sufficient cereal stocks and an upcoming cut in the goods and services tax are anticipated to keep overall inflation in check. This stable outlook provides the Reserve Bank of India with potential room for further monetary policy easing to support economic growth amid ongoing trade concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The growing prominence of Reform UK is creating significant strategic problems for Britain's two major political parties, according to a BBC analysis. For the governing Labour Party, recent internal turmoil and missteps are amplified by the fear that their struggles could inadvertently lead to a government run by Reform, an outcome they deeply oppose. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party faces an existential crisis as it continues to lose key figures like Danny Kruger to Nigel Farage's party, sharpening questions about its own identity and future viability in the current political landscape.</p>

However, reports submitted to the legislature highlight substantial backlogs, with some orders, like the AGM-154C glide bombs, delayed by several years due to production issues. While the influx of weapons, including F-16V fighter jets, will enhance the island's deterrence, the lengthy delays have raised questions about the readiness of Taiwan's forces to integrate and effectively operate the new systems.</p>

According to a review of FAA data, these incidents occur more than three times a day on average and can expose individuals to toxic chemicals from engine oil leaks. Medical experts report treating flight crew members for neurological issues resulting from such exposures. The issue appears more common on Airbus A320 family aircraft, prompting calls from unions for better air filtration systems on all commercial jets.</p>

The court upheld a lower court's ruling that removing Cook would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, which is designed to protect the central bank's independence from political influence. The Trump administration sought to oust Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud, a move her attorneys argued did not meet the legal standard of removal "for cause" and was politically motivated.</p>

A former Biden official countered that the order for the suspect's release from detention was managed by the Trump administration, highlighting the ongoing political battle over immigration enforcement and responsibility for violent crimes committed by non-citizens.</p>

The findings show elevated lead levels not only on destroyed properties but also in the yards of standing homes both inside and outside the official burn scar, posing potential health risks, especially to children.</p>
