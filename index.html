          <p>A woman in Lincolnshire, identified as Jane, had to barricade herself into her rented home every night for over six months after fleeing an abusive relationship because the council failed to fix her broken door lock. North Kesteven District Council admitted to a 'significant failing' and offered her £100 in compensation. The domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales has stated that this 'patchy' target hardening has meant many victims are 'living in daily fear'. Jane said she was 'completely failed' by the council, and did not sleep properly for six months as her patio door did not lock.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times discusses the ethical implications of Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency, highlighting potential conflicts of interest and constitutional issues. Experts argue that Trump's promotion of meme coins and involvement in crypto firms could violate emoluments clauses and bribery provisions. The article points to instances where Trump's official actions have directly benefited his crypto businesses, raising concerns about the blurring of lines between private enterprise and government policy. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, expressed reservations, stating that the situation 'gives me pause'.</p>

          <p>Smokey Robinson and his wife Frances Robinson are being sued by four anonymous former housekeepers who allege sexual assault and a hostile work environment. The accusers, who worked at Robinson's home between 2006 and 2024, are seeking $50 million in damages, claiming repeated sexual assaults and labor code violations. One accuser described a disturbing 'ritual' where Robinson would allegedly lock the door to his 'blue bedroom' and, wearing only his underwear, prepare for the assault. Frances Robinson is accused of perpetuating a hostile work environment and failing to take action despite knowledge of her husband's alleged misconduct.</p>

The stabbing occurred on March 16, and the seal has since recovered and been moved to a more secluded beach in Washington State.

          <p>Asia's largest economies are considering a shift away from the US dollar by approving a new rapid financing mechanism that will use regional currencies, including the Chinese yuan, for the first time. The new scheme is part of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilatalisation (CMIM) and aims to shield countries from financial volatility caused by the US President Donald Trump's global tariff war. This move signals a potential longer-term shift towards a regional monetary mechanism that is less reliant on the dollar, potentially giving China a bigger role in the region's financial landscape.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has formally revoked some layoff notices, restoring staff at the CDC and FDA, including those working on the World Trade Center Health Program. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that these programs were not terminated but consolidated into a new agency. However, not all workers promised reinstatement have received notices, and layoffs at the National Institutes of Health have occurred, driven by the need to reinstate scientists while meeting layoff quotas.

This move, characterized as an 'America First' foreign policy, extracts the U.S. from the conflict but does not end the Houthis' war with Israel. The agreement, mediated by Oman, has sparked questions about its scope and implications for U.S. allies. Some analysts suggest the cease-fire may be linked to ongoing nuclear talks with Iran, the Houthis' main sponsor.</p>

          <p>Percival Everett's novel 'James,' a reimagining of 'Huckleberry Finn,' won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction after the Pulitzer committee's board failed to reach a consensus on the three finalists initially presented by the fiction jury. The board considered 'James' as a fourth option after the initial finalists did not receive a majority vote, highlighting a procedural backstop designed to provide more choices when an impasse occurs. The article explores the unusual process that led to Everett's win and the diverse range of works considered for the prize.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, is shutting down a direct communications channel between U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem working on Palestinian issues and agencies in Washington. This decision effectively ends the special status of the Office of Palestinian Affairs at the embassy, which had been sending cables to Washington without needing approval from embassy leaders. The move is one of Mr. Huckabee's most significant decisions since arriving in Israel in April, and the State Department stated that the change to the office was 'not a reflection on any outreach or commitment to outreach to the people of the West Bank or to Gaza'.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is focusing on logistical and technical issues, rather than constitutional ones, in its efforts to detain and deport international students involved in campus unrest. By avoiding key First Amendment questions, the government has effectively slowed some high-profile cases. This strategy has confounded immigration lawyers and frustrated advocates, as the fates of students like Rumeysa Ozturk and Mohsen Mahdawi have been determined by arbitrary factors like how quickly their lawyers could locate them. The cases highlight the government's tactics in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada met with President Trump days after being elected on an anti-Trump platform, as relations between the two allies are at a historic low. Carney's key goal was to state that Canada is not going to become the 51st U.S. state while avoiding a public fight, and he succeeded. The relationship between the neighbors has been at a historic low since Mr. Trump’s re-election, but Trump struck a more conciliatory tone once the two leaders sat down in the Oval Office.</p>
