          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations. He alleges that Apple's App Store practices make it impossible for his AI company, xAI, to achieve top rankings for its Grok chatbot, favoring competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Musk highlighted that Grok is a top app but is not featured in Apple's "Must Have" section, questioning if the decision is political. This follows previous tensions, including the Department of Justice's existing antitrust lawsuit against Apple over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a significant tariff increase that was set to take effect. This decision keeps US tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances, market access for US exporters, and other national security issues. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two nations have already seen a considerable decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

His exit comes as GitHub faces intensified competition in the AI-powered coding tool market from emerging startups like Cursor and Replit. Dohmke, who has led the platform since 2021, will remain until the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition. Under his leadership, GitHub launched its popular AI tool, Copilot, and saw its registered developer base more than double to 150 million.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the recent firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed slower-than-expected growth.

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has urged the government to guide the country's fiercely competitive e-commerce sector toward sustainable growth. He advised against the current trend of excessive "cash burn" and zero-sum competition in the "quick commerce" market, which promises ultra-fast deliveries. Instead, Wang advocates for policies that foster high-quality development through innovation and an improved industrial ecosystem. This approach aims to create new consumption opportunities and drive long-term economic growth without stifling healthy competition. (not investment advice)</p>

The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that a large group of "bandits" was preparing to attack a local village. These armed groups have been terrorizing communities in the region, engaging in kidnapping for ransom and other violent crimes. Despite repeated military offensives, the violence has persisted, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis by displacing farmers and disrupting food supplies.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Comments on Trump Administration's Revenue-Sharing Deal with Chipmakers</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has commented on the Trump administration's deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue. Cramer argued the arrangement is not novel, comparing it to another form of tariff, with the revenue going directly to the U.S. Treasury. The deal reverses previous restrictions that aimed to block such exports over national security concerns. While acknowledging the "pay-to-play" aspect is debatable, Cramer suggested the policy is a pragmatic solution that benefits both the taxpayers and the chip companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Colorado are struggling to contain two large wildfires, with over a thousand personnel deployed to the front lines. The Lee fire has grown to become the fifth-largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment due to gusty winds and extremely dry conditions. Another blaze, the Elk fire, has burned over 14,000 acres. The fires have forced evacuations in several counties and led to poor air quality across the region, highlighting the growing threat of catastrophic wildfires intensified by climate change.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Federal Takeover of D.C. Police is Based on False Crime Narratives</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's decision to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force argues that the move is based on a false narrative of rampant crime. While Trump cited 2023 crime statistics to justify the action, recent data shows a significant drop in violent crime, which is now at a 30-year low. Critics suggest the president is misrepresenting facts to portray himself as a savior, similar to his previous rhetoric about Los Angeles. This action is seen by many as a political maneuver rather than a data-driven response to a public safety crisis.</p>

          <p>Whistleblowers at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse. In a complaint to the Charity Commission, staff raised alarms about a "toxic internal culture," alleged misuse of public funds, and a potential withdrawal of government funding. The concerns follow a letter from the UK's Technology Secretary, who threatened to pull a £100 million grant unless the institute pivots its research focus toward national defense. The institute's leadership is now facing a crisis of confidence from both its staff and its government funders.</p>

          <p>England footballer Jess Carter has spoken out about the "astronomical" racist abuse she feared her Black teammate, Lauren James, would face after missing a penalty in the Euro 2025 quarter-final. Carter, who was also a target of online racism during the tournament, described feeling a sense of relief when white players also missed penalties, as it diluted the focus on a single Black player. She revealed the psychological toll of the abuse, stating it made her feel "scared to play" in the final. The FA has been working with police to identify those responsible for the abuse.</p>

          <p>The three-year-old case of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved after the killer's new girlfriend went to the police. Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he and his twin brother had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker. This crucial clue allowed police to locate Parsons' remains, leading to the brothers' conviction and bringing a long-awaited resolution to the victim's family.</p>

          <p>A large-scale search in Montgomery County, Ohio, ended with the arrest of an 18-year-old Kentucky man found hiding in a sewer drain. The suspect, Trevor Walker, was wanted in connection with armed robberies and had led police on a high-speed chase in a stolen vehicle before crashing. The discovery of firearms in the vehicle prompted a shelter-in-place advisory for the local area. A SWAT team eventually located Walker, who was soaked in several feet of water, and took him into custody without further incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan for a bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin, which will not include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is being framed as a low-stakes exploratory meeting. Trump has indicated that any potential peace deal would likely involve "land swapping," a concept Zelenskyy has rejected. A recent gaffe, where Trump mistakenly said he was "going to Russia" instead of Alaska for the summit, is seen by analysts as revealing how central Putin is to his political narrative. The approach positions Trump as a pragmatic dealmaker but raises questions about the viability of any agreement reached without Ukraine's direct involvement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has abruptly changed his tone regarding Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting at the White House. This comes just days after Trump had publicly demanded Tan's immediate resignation, citing concerns about the CEO's alleged ties to China. The meeting, which also included the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury, was described as a "candid and constructive discussion." The reversal highlights the administration's volatile but hands-on approach to the semiconductor industry as it navigates trade and technology competition with China.</p>
