          <p>Spanish car-part supplier Gestamp is actively seeking acquisition opportunities in China's automotive sector, contrasting the trend of international firms withdrawing due to intense competition.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that, like all tyrants throughout history, Donald Trump will eventually fall from power. The author suggests that Trump's actions, including his attacks on democracy, disregard for laws and values, and chaotic foreign policy, are unsustainable. While impeachment or the 25th amendment seem unlikely, the author believes Trump's own hubris, failures, and corruption will ultimately lead to his downfall. The author urges democratic forces to contain and oppose Trump, while acknowledging that his greatest enemy is himself.</p>

          <p>The opinion piece argues that the United States and other democracies should do more to support the people of Turkey and pressure President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been shifting the country towards autocracy. The author criticizes Erdogan's actions, including manipulating elections, purging professors, and arresting journalists. The recent detention of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a likely opponent in the next presidential election, is seen as a significant escalation. The author calls for a stronger response from the international community to support democracy in Turkey.</p>

          <p>A letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie, a survivor of the Titanic disaster, sold for £300,000 at auction, significantly exceeding its expected value. The letter, written on April 10, 1912, the day Gracie boarded the ship, contains what has been described as a "prophetic" statement. In the letter, Gracie wrote that he would await his journey's end before passing judgement on the "fine ship."
