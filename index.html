        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New powers in England and Wales now allow for jail sentences of up to two years for water company executives who cover up sewage spills or obstruct investigations. This comes as a critical report from the National Audit Office accuses the government and regulators of mismanagement and failing to drive investment in the water sector, leading to higher bills and consumer distrust. Environment Secretary Steve Reed criticized the previous lack of accountability, noting that no executives had faced penalties despite widespread law-breaking, emphasizing the need for these new powers to ensure compliance and protect the environment.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals mixed American views on President Trump's immigration policies, with divisions on deporting migrants accused of gang membership and international students critical of U.S. policy. However, more respondents support returning Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant deported to El Salvador despite a court order. Overall, Trump's approval rating on immigration is 46%, with partisan divides playing a significant role, as nearly 9 in 10 Republicans approve of his handling of immigration, while 85% of Democrats think he is "going too far" with deportations. The poll highlights varying attitudes across demographics and political affiliations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing deep-sea mining within U.S. and international waters, aiming to secure access to critical minerals like cobalt and rare earths, with the goal of boosting the country's GDP and creating jobs. This move bypasses ongoing UN negotiations and has drawn criticism from China, which dominates the production of these minerals. Environmentalists and scientists express concerns about potential harm to undiscovered deep-sea species and the overall ocean ecosystem, while mining companies argue that the abyssal zone has low concentrations of life. The EU and UK support a moratorium on deep-sea mining until further research is carried out.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles office rental market is facing turbulence with high vacancy rates due to soft tenant demand, despite efforts to bring workers back to the office.

Economic uncertainty caused by trade wars and wildfires has further dampened the market, causing businesses to pause decisions. Downtown Los Angeles is particularly struggling, with vacancy hitting nearly 34%, while some landlords face financial stress, making it difficult to attract tenants.</p>

          <p>California's entertainment industry is seeking state assistance to combat production decline and job losses, with proposed bills to increase film and TV production incentives. These bills aim to make California more competitive by raising the tax credit to 35% and expanding eligibility. However, critics argue that such tax credits are corporate giveaways that don't provide sufficient economic value. The debate comes as California faces economic challenges, forcing legislators to weigh priorities. Supporters argue that the expanded tax credit would generate economic returns beyond the industry, benefiting tourism and small businesses.</p>

Latin American leaders defend social rights and advocate for cooperation over competition, contrasting with the timidity of the Democratic party in the United States.

          <p>This article explores the popularity of the western fence lizard in California, noting it is the most commonly spotted reptile in the state. The lizard has adapted to human environments, often found on fences and in urban areas. The article highlights the lizards' unique characteristics, such as their blue bellies and push-up displays, and discusses their role in urban ecosystems. It also touches on their increasing wariness in urban settings and the importance of preserving even small pockets of space to support biodiversity, and also touches on how the lizards are more easily approached if the approaching human is wearing blue.</p>

          <p>Southern California is expected to experience a cool, wet weather pattern with April showers over the next few days, starting with a possible drizzle Friday morning. The Los Angeles area could see more significant rainfall Saturday as a low-pressure system moves in, with rainfall amounts potentially reaching a quarter-inch in the county and a half-inch in the mountains. The incoming pattern will also bring cooler temperatures, with highs in the low- to mid-60s, but warmer weather is expected to return by Sunday and Monday. Despite the late-season showers, much of Southern California remains in drought conditions after a below-average rainy season.</p>

          <p>Mexico is experiencing a surge in nationalism amid threats from the Trump administration, including tariffs and potential drone strikes, which are viewed as the latest chapter in a history of U.S. aggression. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has walked a fine line between appeasing Trump and defending national sovereignty, invoking history to rally support. The U.S. and Mexico share deep ties, but an undercurrent of hostility is detectable due to how Mexicans are educated about their history. Some Mexicans express concerns about their country's economic strength compared to the U.S., while others see the need to unite and resist.</p>

The researchers estimate that if current vaccination rates persist, there could be over 850,000 measles cases, resulting in hospitalizations and deaths. Even small increases in vaccination rates could prevent this scenario, but further declines could lead to a significant resurgence of the disease. The appointment of Robert F.

UCLA law professor Ahilan Arulanantham contends that sending individuals to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) without due process violates the Constitution. Lawyers and family members claim many of the deported men had no criminal records but were detained based on tattoos.

          <p>The Trump administration's stricter security measures are making it harder for migrant children in federal custody to reunite with their families, requiring proof of income, U.S. identification, and DNA tests. These rules have left undocumented families in desperate situations, causing children to remain in detention longer. Advocates argue that these changes create impossible barriers, exposing families to immigration enforcement and prolonging child detention, which harms their mental health. The administration defends the measures as necessary to protect children, but critics view them as a calculated strategy to impede reunification and extract personal data.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that a toxin called colibactin, produced by certain strains of E. coli, may play a role in the increasing cases of colon cancer among young adults. Researchers found that the majority of colorectal cancers analyzed had mutations signaling a past encounter with colibactin, with those under 40 being three to five times more likely to have these mutations. While the study shows a strong association, it does not prove causation, and researchers believe that colibactin is likely one factor among many contributing to the rise in early-onset colon cancer, with early childhood exposure being a key factor.</p>
