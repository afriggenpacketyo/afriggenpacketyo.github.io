          <p>Kazuto Ioka was unable to reclaim the WBA super flyweight title from Fernando Martinez in their rematch, with Martinez winning by unanimous decision. The fight, a 12-round war, was a repeat of their July 2024 bout where Martinez initially took the belt from Ioka. Ioka briefly gained an advantage by flooring Martinez in the 10th round with a left hook, but he couldn't maintain the momentum to overcome Martinez's earlier aggression. This loss marks a setback for Ioka, who aimed to become the oldest Japanese man to win a world title.</p>

          <p>David Nasaw's New York Times guest essay examines Elon Musk's failed attempt to disrupt Washington's established order during his time advising President Trump. Musk's cost-cutting crusade and public criticism of the administration ultimately led to his marginalization. His reputation suffered as Tesla sales plummeted, and he lost influence over key appointments. The article concludes that Musk's inability to play by Washington's rules and his defiance of political norms led to his downfall, illustrating the limitations of an unelected co-president in the American system.</p>

          <p>Amidst ongoing conflict, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded cautiously to Russia's offer of direct talks, calling it a "positive sign" but emphasizing the need for an immediate cease-fire. This comes after European leaders set a Monday deadline for Russia to agree to a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions, with the United States potentially joining in. Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks in Istanbul but has not accepted the cease-fire proposal, demanding an end to Western arms supplies to Ukraine. Despite these diplomatic efforts, long-range drone attacks by Russia on Ukraine have continued.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The new rules will require care firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas of overseas workers already in the country. This is intended to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers entering the UK over the next year.

          <p>An Atlantic opinion piece describes a family's decision to relocate to Spain after losing their home in a fire and becoming disillusioned with the political climate under the Trump administration. The author reflects on the challenges of rebuilding in a country where they feel increasingly unwelcome and uncertain about the future. The decision to move is framed as a response to the growing shadow of authoritarianism and a desire to find a more stable and welcoming environment for their family.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article explores a growing trend of parents building intentional communities with friends to combat the isolation and challenges of modern parenting. One couple, Charlotte and Raffi, moved next door to their best friends to create a shared support system for raising their children. This arrangement, reminiscent of historical alloparenting, provides mutual aid, shared childcare, and deeper friendships. While challenges exist, such as differing parenting styles and compromises on control, the benefits of shared responsibility and emotional support often outweigh the difficulties.</p>

          <p>A Vox podcast explores the increasing phenomenon of doomsday prepping in America, highlighting that it's not just an extreme fringe activity but a reflection of a deeper cultural trend of self-reliance. From Silicon Valley's luxury "bug-out bags" to FEMA's preparedness recommendations, Americans are increasingly preparing for potential disasters. This trend is driven by factors like economic uncertainty, extreme weather events, and a perceived lack of adequate government response. The ultra-wealthy are also investing in elaborate survival plans, signaling a broader anxiety about the future.</p>
