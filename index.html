          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article reports that the United States is experiencing a significant decrease in violent crime rates, mirroring a sharp increase during the pandemic. FBI data indicates that murder rates fell by nearly 12% year-over-year in 2023, with preliminary 2025 data suggesting further declines, potentially reaching historic lows. The decrease is attributed to the easing of pandemic-related stressors, such as school closures and strained social services, as well as targeted government initiatives like community violence interruption programs. Despite the positive trends, public perception lags, with many Americans still believing crime is on the rise, highlighting a disconnect between reality and perceived safety. </p>

The article claims that networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC dedicated significant airtime to anti-Trump "tell-all" books, while giving limited attention to a recent book detailing Biden's alleged failings. It also suggests that the networks aggressively promoted the White House's narrative on Biden's fitness, dismissing concerns about his age as MAGA talking points. </p>

          <p>The yo-yoing import tariffs imposed by President Trump have been toying with the massive twin-engine economies of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. When you so much as tap the brakes on the port operations ‚Äî and the initial 145% tariffs imposed on China and less elsewhere was more like slamming them on ‚Äî the pileup effect is a trade SigAlert of immense proportions. In early May, the tariff effect meant that the ports clocked a cargo drop of something between 25% and 30%. </p>

          <p>Yara Haridy, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, likes to stun people by telling them that our skeletons evolved from a jawless fish. They find that the sensitivity of our teeth (which causes them to ache and zing when confronted with an icy treat or a dentist's drill) can be traced back to the exoskeletons of those ancient, armored fish. These results explained why we get toothaches. </p>
