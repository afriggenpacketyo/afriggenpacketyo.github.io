          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned a North Korean intelligence operative for orchestrating a scheme that used fraudulent IT workers to fund the nation's weapons programs. The operative, Song Kum Hyok, allegedly stole personal information from U.S. citizens to create fake identities for North Korean workers hired by unsuspecting international companies. This elaborate plot generated millions of dollars, which were funneled directly to Kim Jong Un's regime to support its development of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions also target a Russia-based network involved in a similar scheme.</p>

This development highlights the growing tensions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and the social media company, which has previously sued the Indian IT ministry over what it calls unlawful content removal demands.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is reportedly phasing out the long-standing requirement for passengers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. The rule, in place since 2006 following a failed shoe-bombing attempt, has been a common complaint among travelers. While the TSA has not made a formal announcement, travelers and airport officials at several major U.S. airports have confirmed that the policy is no longer being enforced for standard passengers. The change is attributed to advancements in screening technology that can detect threats without footwear removal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration will impose a 50% tariff on all copper imports, a move intended to bolster domestic production. The announcement, made during a Cabinet meeting, caused copper futures prices to surge to a record high, while shares of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan also rose. The United States currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, for use in a wide range of industrial and technological applications. This action follows a national security investigation into copper imports ordered by the president earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers observed that the aggressive foraging of honeybees removes the vast majority of available pollen from native plants, leaving little for native species like bumblebees.

Tax experts clarify this is inaccurate; the legislation does not eliminate the tax but introduces an additional $6,000 deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and over with incomes below certain thresholds. This "above-the-line" deduction can reduce a senior's adjusted gross income, thereby indirectly lowering the amount of their Social Security benefits subject to taxation. However, it does not remove the tax itself and primarily benefits middle-income seniors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>My 2 Cents, a celebrated soul food bistro on West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles, will permanently close at the end of July after a 12-year run. Chef Alisa Reynolds, known for her modern, L.A.-influenced take on Southern comfort food, cited financial pressures from the pandemic, industry strikes, and development pressure as reasons for the closure. The restaurant was a beloved neighborhood anchor and was listed among the city's best, helping to define a new style of soul food in the region. Reynolds plans to focus on catering, pop-ups, and product development in the future.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas that killed over 100 people were caused by a confluence of weather factors that dumped massive amounts of rain over a flood-prone region. Moisture from a tropical system, combined with other atmospheric disturbances, stalled over the Texas Hill Country, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and adequacy of their emergency warnings to residents and summer camps. The event, described as a "100-year flood," has triggered a massive search and rescue operation.</p>

          <p>"The Daily Show" host Jon Stewart sharply criticized parent company Paramount Global for its $16 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump against CBS News. Stewart and guest Steve Kroft characterized the payment as "protection money" to ensure that the company's pending merger with Skydance Media would not be blocked by the Trump-influenced FCC. The original lawsuit, which 1st Amendment experts called frivolous, claimed "60 Minutes" unfairly edited an interview with Kamala Harris. Stewart argued the settlement represented fealty to Trump rather than journalistic accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about future inflation have subsided, returning to levels seen before the Trump administration's recent trade tariff announcements. In June, respondents' expectation for inflation one year from now fell back to 3%, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. This decline in public sentiment comes despite ongoing trade negotiations and threats of new tariffs. While the overall inflation outlook has eased, the survey still shows that consumers expect higher prices for specific costs like medical care, college, and rent. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant reversal of a 70-year-old policy, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. The filing clarifies that communications from a house of worship to its congregation on electoral politics, when viewed through the lens of faith, do not violate the Johnson Amendment. This move, which settles a lawsuit brought by religious groups, effectively ends the long-standing prohibition on such endorsements. The change aligns with a long-held goal of President Donald Trump, who had called for the repeal of the amendment.</p>

Players like Diego Luna emerged as strong contenders for future rosters, demonstrating the hunger and pride the coach sought to instill.

The fire has burned approximately 700 hectares, with authorities urging residents to stay indoors and keep roads clear for emergency services.
