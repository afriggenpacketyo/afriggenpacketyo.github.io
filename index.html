          <p>An editorial in the People's Liberation Army's official newspaper has harshly criticized nine recently expelled generals, accusing them of being disloyal and causing a "serious blow" to the military. The article stated the generals experienced a "total collapse of their beliefs" and undermined the core principle of the party's absolute command over the army. The piece emphasized that their actions severely damaged the military's integrity and accountability to the Central Military Commission's chairman. This public condemnation follows speculation about the nature of their transgressions, which have not been detailed by the party.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release after serving less than three months for wire fraud and identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited what he described as horrible mistreatment of Santos in prison and praised his record of voting with the Republican party. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from both Democrats and several New York Republicans, who argued that the short time served does not constitute justice for his crimes. Santos had recently published a letter pleading with the president for clemency, highlighting his unwavering support for Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>A jury in Denver has awarded $19.7 million in damages to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 police shooting in the city's Lower Downtown area. The civil lawsuit was filed after three officers opened fire on a man who had drawn a handgun, with one officer, Brandon Ramos, firing into a crowd. Ramos, who later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and resigned, was found by a grand jury to have failed to account for the public's safety. The victims' attorneys stated the verdict sends a clear message about police conduct and accountability for innocent people harmed during such incidents.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump has publicly called for Kyiv and Moscow to "stop where they are" and end the war, suggesting both sides could claim victory. This marks a shift in his position, moving back toward the idea of Ukraine conceding territory to achieve peace along current front lines. During the talks, Trump also expressed hesitation about providing Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles. Zelenskyy acknowledged the need to halt the fighting to begin dialogue but did not directly address the territorial implications of Trump's proposal.</p>

          <p>US podcaster Johnathan Walton, who was instrumental in the capture and conviction of con artist Marianne Smyth, has voiced his disappointment with her four-year prison sentence in Northern Ireland. Smyth was found guilty of defrauding four people of over $155,000 while working as a mortgage adviser. Walton, who was also a victim of Smyth in Los Angeles and detailed her schemes in his podcast, stated that the sentence was too lenient for a woman he described as an "inveterate con woman." He fears that without a longer period of confinement, she will inevitably return to scamming innocent people upon her release.</p>

He asserted that the AfD's goal is to destroy the CDU, not cooperate with it. Merz also attributed the AfD's rise partly to the migration policies of former Chancellor Angela Merkel and the current coalition government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the cumulative tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as "not sustainable," while defending the policy as a necessary response to Beijing's actions. The statement comes as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare for a new round of trade talks next week in Malaysia, aiming to prevent further escalation in the economic conflict. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to negotiate a truce before a current agreement expires on November 10. The talks follow China's recent expansion of export controls on rare-earth elements, a move that prompted further tariff threats from Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the Galleri blood test can successfully identify more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis and screening. Results from a trial in North America involving 25,000 adults showed the test detected cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with cancer later confirmed in 62% of those positive cases. Significantly, more than half of the cancers were found at an early stage, and three-quarters were types for which no routine screening programs currently exist. The NHS is conducting its own large-scale trial, with results expected next year to determine its future use in the UK.</p>

Some Republican figures have labeled the demonstrations "Hate America" rallies and accused organizers of being allied with Antifa, raising concerns about potential unrest.

          <p>Dozens of South Korean nationals who were detained in Cambodia for their alleged involvement in cyberscam operations have been repatriated and arrested upon arrival at Incheon International Airport. The suspects are implicated in crimes including voice phishing and romance scams, and authorities will investigate whether they participated willingly or were coerced. The repatriation follows public outrage in South Korea over the death of a student who was reportedly kidnapped and tortured by a crime ring in Cambodia. In response, Seoul has issued a top-level travel ban for certain parts of the Southeast Asian nation.</p>

          <p>At least ten people were hospitalized after a wooden balcony on a third-floor apartment collapsed on Friday evening in Cincinnati, Ohio. The incident occurred in the Corryville neighborhood near the University of Cincinnati campus, and many of the injured were students attending a gathering. Cincinnati Fire Chief Frank McKinley confirmed that at least one person sustained life-threatening injuries, though the exact conditions of the other victims were not immediately known. The cause of the collapse is currently under investigation, and it remains unclear how many people were on the balcony at the time.</p>

          <p>Chinese auto brands have significantly increased their market share in South Africa, with sales volumes for their SUVs growing by 86% in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year. According to S&P Global Mobility, Chinese manufacturers now hold 15% of the total market, largely driven by strong performances from Chery and Haval. While Japanese brands like Toyota and Suzuki still lead in overall sales volume, their market dominance is declining as Chinese competitors gain traction. This shift highlights the growing influence and competitiveness of China's automotive industry in international markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani produced one of the greatest individual postseason performances in baseball history, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a 5-1 victory that swept the Milwaukee Brewers. In a remarkable two-way display, Ohtani hit three home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out ten batters while allowing no runs into the seventh inning. His dominant outing, which earned him NLCS MVP honors, single-handedly ended a personal postseason slump and solidified the Dodgers' return to the Fall Classic. Teammates and management described the performance as legendary and perhaps the best ever seen in a playoff game.</p>

          <p>The damage from a severe storm that struck remote Alaskan villages is so extensive that many of the 2,000 displaced residents may not be able to return home for at least 18 months, according to Governor Mike Dunleavy. In a request for a major disaster declaration, the governor noted that in one village, 90% of the homes were destroyed by flooding and high surf from the remnants of Typhoon Halong. More than 2,000 people have been evacuated, with many being airlifted to Anchorage, where officials are working to arrange long-term housing. The storm has devastated low-lying coastal communities that are only accessible by air or water.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 23:00:12 EDT</div>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has developed a new computing pooling solution named Aegaeon, which it claims can cut the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to serve its AI models by 82%. During a three-month test in Alibaba's model marketplace, the system reduced the required Nvidia H20 GPUs from 1,192 to just 213. The technology addresses a major inefficiency in cloud services, where a large number of GPUs are often allocated to serve AI models that are only used sporadically. This innovation could lead to significant cost savings and more efficient resource allocation for cloud providers running concurrent large language model workloads.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that prosecutors have until June 1, 2026, to begin a retrial for Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted in the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz. If jury selection for what would be his third trial does not commence by that date, Hernandez will be released from custody. His 2017 conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court, which found that the trial judge gave the jury incorrect instructions regarding his confession. Hernandez's attorneys have long argued that his confession was false and a product of mental illness.</p>
