        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing is reportedly close to reaching a deal with the Justice Department that would allow the aerospace company to avoid pleading guilty or facing trial in a criminal case related to the two deadly 737 Max crashes. This development comes after a judge rejected a previous plea deal due to concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion, which reopened the possibility of a trial for Boeing on fraud charges related to misleading regulators about the flight-control system implicated in the crashes. The potential new agreement would aim to settle the case without a trial. The fraud charge stems from Boeing's development of the 737 Max. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten adult men remain at large after escaping from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. One inmate, Kendall Myles, was apprehended in the French Quarter, but authorities consider the remaining escapees armed and dangerous, with one, Gary Price, charged with attempted first-degree murder. Sheriff Susan Hutson has launched a full investigation into the escape, reviewing facility protocols and security measures. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick indicated that a group of people believed to be victims of the inmates were immediately removed from their homes and "taken to safety."</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners, halting the bill's progress. Republican Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns that the bulk of savings would not take effect until after Trump leaves office. This move represents a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump, who had urged Republicans to unite behind the bill. House Republican leaders will continue negotiations with holdouts, and the Budget Committee will reconvene on Monday to address the issues.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are currently falling after a steady surge, presenting potential investment opportunities for those with a longer-term view. Physical gold bullion, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks are three gold investments that could pay off as prices fall. Investors may be able to capitalize on lower prices by purchasing gold-related assets before the next upswing, as gold has historically rebounded after similar dips, particularly during economic uncertainty. It's important to remember that timing the bottom perfectly is nearly impossible, but for those with a disciplined approach and a belief in gold's enduring value, today's falling prices could lay the groundwork for tomorrow's gains.

This heat wave is expected to be more persistent than the previous one, potentially foreshadowing a hot and potentially fiery summer for much of the West, including California.

The staff hopes unionization will restore security, improve transparency, and enhance communication from leadership, which they say has been lacking.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Trump administration for an Instagram post featuring seashells arranged into the numbers "8647," which some officials interpreted as a threat to the president. Comey deleted the photo and said he assumed the shells were a political message, not a violent one. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced her department and the Secret Service are investigating the post. The "8647" slogan has quietly become a code for opposition to Trump, circulating in TikTok posts and on protest signs in recent months.</p>

          <p>British rock band Sleep Token has achieved their first UK number one album with their fourth full-length release, 'Even In Arcadia.'

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a major setback after conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee, citing insufficient cuts to federal spending. The legislation, aimed at extending tax cuts from Trump's first term, has faced disagreements between conservative members and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to putting the legislation on the floor before Memorial Day, despite the divisions within his party. Meanwhile, a group of Republicans from blue states have threatened to withhold their support if the bill does not raise a cap on state and local taxes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a federal judge's order to halt large-scale staffing cuts and the restructuring of agencies. The Justice Department argued that the judicial order prevents the executive branch from formulating and implementing plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston had blocked the layoffs, finding that Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering the downsizing. The administration has aggressively challenged universal injunctions, which can prevent the government from applying a policy against anyone, instead of only the plaintiffs who sued to contest it.</p>

          <p>The man convicted of trying to stab Salman Rushdie to death was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison for the attack, which left the acclaimed author critically injured and blind in one eye. The defendant, Hadi Matar, said he believed Mr. Rushdie to be a hypocrite and a bully. Judge David W. Foley told Mr. Matar that his assault had been against not only a man, but also the right to free expression. Mr. Matar was found guilty of assaulting Mr. Reese as well, and Judge Foley on Friday sentenced him to the maximum seven years in prison for that charge, though he will serve that time concurrently with the 25-year sentence for attempted murder.</p>

Apple is appealing the ruling and has said it strongly disagreed with the judge’s decision.

The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures. Low-income households spend a larger share of their incomes on energy costs, and may struggle to afford to keep their homes cool.</p>
