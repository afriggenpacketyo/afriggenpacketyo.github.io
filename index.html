        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese military magazine article suggests that targeting Taiwan's critical infrastructure could cripple the island's defenses without direct combat. The article identifies 30 to 40 key targets, such as liquefied natural gas facilities, whose disruption could trigger a cascading failure of essential systems. The analysis posits that cutting off electricity and water supplies could paralyze transportation, communication, and medical services, ultimately undermining the will to resist. The article emphasizes the tactic of "urban collapse warfare" as a cost-effective military option, exploiting Taiwan's reliance on imported resources and vulnerability to natural disasters. Optimism is low given the implications of this potential strategy.</p>

          <p>A Saturday NCAA baseball game between Samford and Mercer descended into turmoil after a Samford player, Michael Gupton, appeared to taunt Mercer players following a home run. This led to a heated confrontation, resulting in the ejection of Gupton and Mercer shortstop Bradley Frye, as well as coaches from both teams. The situation escalated further when Frye's mother was also ejected for her reaction, and other Mercer fans were removed for going onto the dugout roof. The game was delayed for approximately 25 minutes before Samford ultimately secured a 5-1 victory, advancing to the SoCon championship game.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine completed a large prisoner exchange, releasing over 300 soldiers each in a rare moment of cooperation during the ongoing conflict. The exchange, agreed upon during talks in Turkey, involved a total of 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees. However, even amid the prisoner swap, Russia continued its offensive, launching significant drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. These attacks, which killed at least 12 people and injured dozens, drew condemnation from U.S. President Trump, who stated he was considering additional sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has agreed to postpone threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 after a "very nice call" with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen stated that Europe is ready to swiftly advance talks to reach a deal, requiring the time until July 9 to do so. The negotiations aim to avert a transatlantic trade war, following Trump's earlier threat to impose tariffs on all EU imports. This decision offers a temporary reprieve as both sides seek to resolve trade disputes and avoid further economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, people commemorated the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, with gatherings in Houston and Minneapolis. Floyd's murder by police in Minneapolis sparked widespread protests against racism and police brutality in 2020. While some hail the period following Floyd's death as a national reckoning with racism, others observe a decline in momentum for police reforms, particularly with President Trump rolling back some measures. Activists and community leaders are urging continued commitment to change, particularly pressing President Trump to uphold federal police reform agreements, as the nation reflects on the impact of Floyd's death.</p>

          <p>As AI technology rapidly advances, the question of whether machines can become conscious is increasingly debated. Some experts believe that as AI systems become more intelligent, they may develop independent consciousness, while others argue that consciousness is unique to living systems. The discussion is fueled by the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and the potential for AI to interact with the real world through sensory inputs. Concerns are also rising about the ethical implications of creating machines that may have feelings and empathy, and how this might affect human relationships and moral priorities.</p>

          <p>Charities are urging the UK government to resume processing Syrian asylum claims, as over 7,000 people remain in limbo following a pause in decisions due to the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. The Refugee Council and other organizations argue that the indefinite delay leaves individuals in a precarious situation and advocate for case-by-case assessments. The government paused decisions in December, citing the need to evaluate the situation in Syria. Advocates argue that many Syrians still fear returning due to ongoing instability and the rise of Islamist militant groups.</p>

Villa captain John McGinn called the decision "incredible," while pundits Alan Shearer and Micah Richards agreed that Bayindir was not in control of the ball, leading to a significant error that VAR could not overturn due to the referee's early whistle.</p>
