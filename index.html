        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of Japan's House of Councilors election, far-right parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These groups are stoking fears related to unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners, mirroring tactics from movements like Donald Trump's MAGA. While defenders of immigration highlight Japan's severe labor shortages, nationalist politicians argue for stricter controls and leveraging domestic capabilities. This political shift reflects broader societal anxieties as Japan grapples with economic pressures and its cultural identity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 11:57:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Detectives investigating the murder of 15-year-old Rene Graham have released CCTV footage of a suspect in an effort to identify him. Graham was fatally shot in the chest at a music festival in a west London park in July 2024. The newly released video shows the suspected gunman walking toward the park, and later chasing a second potential victim with a gun in hand after the shooting. Authorities and the Crimestoppers charity are offering a £20,000 reward for information leading to the killer's conviction, urging the community to help bring justice to the victim's family.</p>

          <p>During a game against the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. executed a remarkable defensive play. After catching a deep fly ball in right field, he made a powerful and precise throw to third base to get a runner out, completing an inning-ending double play. The throw was widely praised by his manager and teammates for its accuracy and strength, and it proved pivotal in preventing the Yankees from a potential game-tying rally. Acuña attributed the play to his focus on anticipating game situations.</p>

The report revealed that workers had reported vibrations and were told to cover up cracks, with a safety officer resigning in protest before the collapse.

          <p>This article examines the complex legal and economic ramifications if President Trump were to attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Legal experts suggest such a move would face a high legal bar, requiring proof of "cause," and would likely trigger a protracted court battle that could reach the Supreme Court. The unprecedented action could create significant market uncertainty, potentially undermining the Fed's independence and credibility. An attempt to remove Powell could also harden the central bank's policy stance and lead to higher long-term interest rates, contrary to the president's goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway asserts that the advice to "follow your passion" is the worst career guidance given by billionaires, as they are already wealthy. Instead, he advocates for finding an intersection between one's talents and what is financially lucrative. Galloway shares his own journey from a low-income background to becoming a self-made millionaire, emphasizing that his success came from identifying his strengths and enduring rejection, not just following a passion. The article suggests that a practical approach, combined with a growth mindset, is more effective for building a successful career.</p>

          <p>Tanning is experiencing a cultural comeback, moving beyond aesthetics to become an ideological statement for some. The article notes a renewed popularity of tans in pop culture and among youth, alongside a rise in anti-sunscreen sentiment in alternative-health circles associated with the Trump administration's 'Make America Healthy Again' movement. These groups often promote sun exposure and are skeptical of public health warnings about skin cancer, framing sun avoidance as a conspiracy.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific arm. This move is part of a broader restructuring that will also reduce the agency's total staff by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the changes would better equip the agency for its core mission, but critics, including union leaders and Democratic lawmakers, warn the move will devastate public health and environmental protection.

          <p>This opinion piece explores President Donald Trump's distinctive and often confusing communication style, which blends jokes, hyperbole, threats, and serious policy statements. The author argues that this approach makes it nearly impossible for the public and political observers to know when he is being serious, creating a state of constant uncertainty. This strategy gives him unprecedented leeway to act on his words without facing typical scrutiny or debate, as people are still trying to decide if he means what he says. The article reflects on how this dynamic has shaped American politics over the last decade.</p>

While the IAEA has not reported increased radiation levels in the region, experts express concern about the potential release of toxic uranium hexafluoride gas.

They suggest that true financial well-being is better measured by cash flow and whether one's financial habits align with their personal values and goals.
