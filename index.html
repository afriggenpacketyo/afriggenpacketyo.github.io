          <p>India stated its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan targeting "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir following a militant attack last month. The Indian Ministry of Defence emphasized the actions were "focused, measured, and non-escalatory" and targeted nine sites used for planning attacks against India, while denying targeting Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan's Information Minister accused India of violating its territorial sovereignty and attacking civilians, vowing a robust response. The strikes, labeled "Operation Sindoor," have significantly escalated tensions between the two nations. Optimism score is lowered due to the risk of escalation.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster the economy amidst trade concerns. The measures aim to support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, and establish a relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While these steps signal urgency in addressing economic challenges, analysts suggest their impact on boosting domestic credit demand may be limited.
