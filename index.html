        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has updated its immunization schedule, recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as six months. This guidance directly contradicts the current federal stance from the Trump administration's health agencies, which advise "shared clinical decision-making" rather than universal vaccination for this age group. The AAP emphasizes that infants and toddlers face significant risks from severe Covid-19, while HHS officials accuse the pediatric group of being influenced by corporate interests and undermining the CDC's authority. The disagreement highlights a growing rift between medical organizations and federal health policy regarding childhood immunizations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, currently a category two storm, is churning in the Atlantic and is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland. However, its large size is generating life-threatening rip currents and potential coastal flooding from Florida to New England, with North Carolina's Outer Banks facing mandatory evacuations. The storm previously caused power outages for over 150,000 people in Puerto Rico. Forecasters warn that the hurricane, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is unusually large and could grow even bigger as it moves north between Bermuda and the U.S. coast.</p>

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the deportation, stating he will face charges related to alleged arms and drug trafficking, as well as ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. Chávez Jr. was initially arrested in the U.S. for overstaying his visa and has a history of legal issues, including a DUI and illegal gun possession. Department of Homeland Security documents also note his alleged affiliation with the cartel, adding another layer to his long-standing personal and legal troubles.</p>

          <p>Texas State Representative Nicole Collier, a Democrat, has filed a court petition alleging she is being illegally confined within the Texas Capitol. After returning from a walkout intended to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, Collier refused a state police escort and was allegedly told she would be arrested if she left the building. Her legal filing argues that while lawmakers can be compelled to attend a session if absent, there is no legal basis to detain a legislator who is already present. The standoff is the latest development in a contentious political battle over congressional redistricting in the state.</p>

With 3,800 biotech companies already established, the city plans to attract more top-tier firms by offering substantial subsidies and aims to host over 10,000 companies by 2030. This ambition is supported by local academic institutions, such as Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, which has co-founded an Academy of Pharmacy to train future leaders in drug innovation. The initiative represents a significant strategic investment by China to dominate a key high-tech industry.</p>

          <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has publicly rejected the Trump administration's threats to prosecute officials in "sanctuary jurisdictions" that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. In a press conference, Wu stated that "Boston will not back down," asserting that the city follows the law and will not be coerced by what she called unlawful threats from the Department of Justice. The confrontation comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters to 22 local governments, warning of potential legal action or loss of federal funds. Wu's response frames the issue as a defense of city values against federal overreach and political attacks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order to end mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, claiming the practice is corrupt and benefits Democrats. However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to dictate how states conduct elections. The U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections, with a secondary role for Congress, but no specified role for the executive branch. This sets up a potential legal and political clash over election administration, despite Trump's own party utilizing mail-in voting in the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new, tiny moon orbiting the planet Uranus, provisionally named S/2025 U1. The satellite, which is only about six miles in diameter, was identified by the James Webb Space Telescope and is the 29th known moon of the ice giant. Its small size is likely why it was missed by previous observations, including the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986. Researchers suggest the discovery could hint at the existence of more small moons, offering new insights into the planet's potentially chaotic evolutionary history. The moon will be officially named later by the International Astronomical Union.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II is not about inciting hatred but about remembering historical truths. The author contends that remembering the brutality of the Japanese military aggression is distinct from attitudes toward modern Japanese culture and people. Drawing from personal experience growing up with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime, the writer suggests that one can condemn past actions and attempts to distort history while simultaneously embracing contemporary Japan. The piece frames the remembrance as a necessary reflection on sacrifice and resilience, not as a tool for vengeance.</p>

          <p>Uganda's Tax Appeals Tribunal has ordered Allied Beverages Limited, a marketing agency for Coca-Cola, to pay 9.7 billion UGX (approximately $2.7 million) in value-added tax. The agency had classified its services as exports to the U.S.-based Coca-Cola Export Corporation to avoid the 18% VAT rate. However, the tribunal ruled that since the promotional activities, such as advertisements, were consumed within Uganda and benefited the local bottler, the tax is applicable. The decision underscores the efforts of national revenue authorities to ensure multinational corporations and their partners comply with local tax laws.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine suggests a significant focus on the process of negotiation rather than the substantive details of a peace deal. While Trump appears to see a sequence of meetings with Putin and Zelensky as the path to a resolution, European leaders are more concerned with crucial details like cease-fire terms and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine. This disconnect highlights a potential weakness in Trump's dealmaking strategy, as it may not account for Vladimir Putin's apparent lack of interest in a genuine deal or the politically unacceptable terms for Ukraine.

The company still anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year, signaling confidence in its business despite a challenging economic environment for home improvement. Executives noted that while many homeowners are still deferring large projects due to economic uncertainty, they saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions over $1,000. The company's performance reflects a gradual but building momentum in its core business categories. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: 'Abundance Liberalism' Faces Political Hurdles Within the Democratic Party</h2>

          <p>A political ideology known as "abundance liberalism," which advocates for overcoming bureaucratic hurdles to build more housing, clean energy, and infrastructure, is gaining traction among Democratic elites. Popularized by writers like Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, the movement seeks to replace a perceived liberalism of scarcity and regulation with one focused on growth and construction. However, the article suggests this vision faces significant political challenges from within the party itself, particularly from established constituencies in areas like the Maryland suburbs. These groups often resist the large-scale development, such as affordable housing projects, that the abundance agenda requires, creating a treacherous internal political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a flurry of diplomatic activity, including summits with both Vladimir Putin and European leaders, President Trump's goal of ending the Russia-Ukraine war faces formidable challenges. While Trump has shown openness to providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand from Kyiv, it remains unclear if Putin genuinely desires an end to the conflict while his forces are making battlefield gains. Furthermore, Trump's own mercurial nature and the potential for skepticism from his "America first" political base could undermine the stability of any U.S. commitments. The path to a lasting peace remains narrow, with fundamental disagreements and a lack of trust between the key parties.</p>

          <p>Global electric vehicle leader BYD has officially registered its local unit in Argentina as a car manufacturer, fueling speculation that it plans to establish a production facility in the country. The legal filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina not just to import and sell vehicles, but also to manufacture them, along with batteries and other parts. While the company has not confirmed specific plans, this move aligns with its broader regional expansion strategy in Latin America, which includes a major factory already under development in Brazil. If it proceeds, the plant would be BYD's second in Latin America, significantly boosting its presence in the region's auto market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his intention to combat what he calls "woke" content in museums across the United States, including the Smithsonian Institution. In a social media post, he criticized museums for focusing on negative aspects of American history like slavery and instructed his attorneys to apply the same tactics used against universities. This strategy has involved threatening to withhold federal funding and launching investigations into institutions like Harvard and Columbia over alleged ideological biases. The move signals a potential new front in the culture war, with the administration using financial leverage to influence the content and narratives presented by cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney's office for the District of Columbia has reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department over allegations of systematically falsifying crime data. The probe follows the suspension of a police commander in May for allegedly altering crime reports to make the city appear safer. President Trump commented on the investigation, claiming D.C. provided "fake crime numbers." This development escalates the conflict between the Trump administration and D.C. officials, who have cited declining crime rates to argue against the federal takeover of local policing, a claim the police union has called "preposterous."</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent summits with Russian and Ukrainian leaders have meaningfully increased the possibility of ending the war in Ukraine. The author suggests that despite ongoing Russian aggression, Trump's willingness to discuss security guarantees and facilitate a potential trilateral meeting represents a positive step. The article acknowledges formidable obstacles, such as Putin's territorial demands and the risk of dividing Ukrainian society. However, it concludes that Trump can keep the process on track by using his skills in strategic ambiguity and leveraging U.S. military and economic power to pressure Russia toward a genuine compromise.</p>

Data shows that beverage-specific purchases are on the rise, with customers increasingly visiting chains for a "pick-me-up" rather than as a meal add-on. Companies are responding with customized, cold, and colorful drinks, from Dunkin's Refreshers to McDonald's upcoming "dirty sodas" and Starbucks' new protein cold foam. This strategic shift reflects the higher profitability of beverages compared to food and represents a key effort to reverse sales slumps in a challenging consumer environment.
