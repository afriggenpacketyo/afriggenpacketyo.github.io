          <p>Apple, in conjunction with President Trump, announced it will increase its U.S. spending by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion. The investment aims to bolster the domestic supply chain, with a significant $2.5 billion expansion planned for its partnership with Corning, the manufacturer of iPhone glass in Kentucky. This move comes amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs, with Apple aiming to reshore more of its manufacturing and component sourcing to the United States. The company stated the investment would support numerous U.S.-based partners and expand data center operations. (not investment advice)</p>

The article recounts the horrific immediate aftermath, where hundreds of thousands died, and the slow, arduous process of rebuilding. It also reflects on the current global landscape, noting that nine nations now possess nuclear weapons amid rising geopolitical tensions.

          <p>An active-duty sergeant, identified as 28-year-old Quornelius Radford, allegedly opened fire on his coworkers at Fort Stewart, Georgia, wounding five fellow soldiers before being subdued by others at the scene. Officials stated that all five victims are in stable condition and expected to recover, with three requiring surgery. The suspect reportedly used a personal weapon, and investigators are still determining a motive, though they have ruled out terrorism. The base was temporarily locked down, and the Army's Criminal Investigative Division is leading the ongoing investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty reported a 30% drop in net income for its fiscal first quarter, attributing the decline to the financial impact of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The cosmetics company, which sources a majority of its products from China, saw its net income fall to $33.3 million and declined to provide a full-year forecast due to tariff uncertainty. Despite the profit slump, the company's revenue and adjusted earnings per share beat Wall Street expectations, with sales rising 9% to $354 million. E.l.f. has raised some prices and is working to diversify its supply chain to mitigate the ongoing financial pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) and a money market account for a $10,000 investment. While current interest rates are similar, a CD offers a fixed rate, guaranteeing returns and protecting against potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. In contrast, money market accounts have variable rates that would likely decrease if the Fed lowers rates as anticipated. The analysis concludes that while the immediate earning difference is minimal, the CD provides greater security and predictability for maximizing returns over the six-month period.

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking regulatory approval for a nearly $10 billion rate hike over the next four years, a move critics call the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the increase is essential for grid reliability, diversifying energy sources, and reducing fuel costs, particularly for solar and battery storage projects. However, environmental groups and consumer advocates oppose the plan, arguing it will exacerbate the state's affordability crisis and primarily serve to boost shareholder profits. The Florida Public Service Commission will hold hearings and make a final decision on the controversial proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham has been fined $1,500 by the WNBA for publicly criticizing referees for a second time, just days after receiving a $500 fine for similar comments. The latest fine was issued after she discussed the league's officiating on her new podcast, stating that while she understands the job is difficult, the inconsistency is a major issue. Cunningham has gained increased attention this season, partly for her vocal defense of teammate Caitlin Clark. She acknowledged on her podcast that she anticipated the second, larger fine for her continued commentary on the referees.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended $584 million in federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing alleged civil rights violations related to antisemitism. The move, which targets funding from major bodies like the National Institutes of Health, is described by the university's chancellor as potentially "devastating" for life-saving research. The action follows a lawsuit settlement where UCLA agreed to pay $6 million over claims it failed to protect Jewish students during pro-Palestinian protests in 2024. University officials argue the cuts are punitive and ignore the extensive measures UCLA has already taken to combat antisemitism. (not investment advice)</p>

Three prominent House Democrats sent a letter expressing "grave concern" over the move, calling it a dangerous concession to Beijing.

This phenomenon, often involving organizations known as "paper mills," is polluting the scientific literature in certain fields and undermining trust in the research process.

          <h2>Rancho Palos Verdes Moves to Ban New Construction in Active Landslide Zone</h2>

          <p>The city council of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, has voted to permanently ban most new construction across a 715-acre area affected by a destructive and accelerating landslide. The decision, which still requires a final vote, would prohibit new development and home additions but allow for the repair and replacement of existing homes within their original footprint. The move is a response to unprecedented land movement over the past two years that has fractured homes and damaged infrastructure. While city officials cite public safety as the primary concern, the ban faces opposition from some landowners in the affected neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>The political standoff over Texas redistricting escalated as Democratic lawmakers, who fled to Illinois to block a Republican-led bill, were evacuated from their hotel due to a bomb threat. The threat was later found to be unsubstantiated, but lawmakers framed it as a result of heated rhetoric from Republican leaders. The incident occurred as Texas Governor Greg Abbott petitioned the state supreme court to declare a leading Democrat's seat vacant for abdicating his duties. This high-stakes confrontation is part of a broader national battle over gerrymandering, with Texas Republicans aiming to solidify their congressional majority.</p>

          <p>A retired police officer who worked as a security guard for the Miami Heat has been federally charged with stealing over $2 million worth of team memorabilia, including a jersey LeBron James wore in the 2013 NBA Finals. The accused, Marcus Thomas Perez, allegedly used his access to a secure equipment room to steal more than 400 game-worn jerseys and other items between 2016 and 2025. He then allegedly sold the items to online brokers for prices well below their market value. The stolen LeBron James jersey, for example, was reportedly sold by Perez for $100,000 before being auctioned later for $3.7 million.</p>

          <p>A 62-year-old British man on holiday in Florida has been arrested and charged with attempted second-degree murder after allegedly trying to drown his daughter-in-law in a swimming pool. The incident occurred at a resort near Walt Disney World following an argument over his grandchildren. According to the Polk County Sheriff's department, Mark Gibbon pushed the 33-year-old woman's head underwater multiple times, preventing her from breathing. The assault allegedly stopped only when neighboring vacationers intervened and called law enforcement. Gibbon is also facing two counts of battery and is being held in the Polk County Jail.</p>

          <p>A zoo in Aalborg, Denmark, has generated both intrigue and controversy after a social media post asking the public to donate unwanted pets to be used as food for its predators went viral. The zoo specified that it accepts animals like chickens, rabbits, and guinea pigs, which are "gently euthanized" to provide a natural diet for carnivores such as the European lynx. While many commenters were appalled by the idea of euthanizing pets for feed, others defended the practice as a practical and natural way to maintain the food chain in captivity. The zoo clarified that this has been a common practice for years and does not include dogs or cats.</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire raging in the Aude region of southern France has been declared a "catastrophe on an unprecedented scale" by the country's prime minister. The blaze, France's largest since 1949, has killed an elderly woman, scorched an area larger than Paris, and forced thousands to evacuate. Over 2,150 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, are battling the fire, which has been fueled by drought, high temperatures, and strong winds. Officials have linked the disaster to global warming and warned that the fire could continue to burn for several more days.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fell more than 6% after the chipmaker reported earnings that fell short of analyst expectations and raised concerns about its business in China. CEO Lisa Su noted that U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI chips had a significant impact on revenue, and the company's forecast did not include potential sales from a specialized chip designed for the Chinese market. Investors also expressed concerns about the growth rate of its datacenter business. While AMD's overall revenue grew 32% year-over-year, the earnings miss and uncertainty surrounding China shipments weighed heavily on the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's trade policy goals appear to be at odds, creating a potential bottleneck for U.S. energy exports. While the administration has secured commitments for future liquified natural gas (LNG) purchases from foreign nations, a separate U.S. Trade Representative mandate to promote domestic shipbuilding could hinder these sales. The policy requires a growing percentage of LNG exports to be carried on U.S.-built ships, but the U.S. currently has almost no capacity to build such vessels, which are far more expensive than those from Asian shipyards. This conflict could make it difficult to fulfill export deals and risks undermining the administration's energy trade objectives. (not investment advice)</p>
