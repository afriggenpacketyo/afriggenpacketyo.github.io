        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached an agreement with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cost of popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for employers and their workers. This deal aims to provide access to these medications at a reduced price for plan sponsors, capping monthly out-of-pocket costs for members at $200. The new arrangement also includes a streamlined pre-authorization process and consistent pricing across retail pharmacies and Evernorth's home delivery service, with potential cost reductions of up to 20% for existing clients already covering weight loss drugs. This move comes after CVS Caremark's announcement to prioritize Novo's Wegovy, potentially impacting coverage for Lilly's Zepbound. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Boston determined that the Trump administration violated an order barring officials from deporting individuals to countries not their own without adequate notice. Lawyers for the migrants said they were told they were being sent to South Sudan, but the flight landed in Djibouti. Judge Murphy criticized the administration's actions as "unquestionably violative" of the court's order and is considering criminal contempt penalties for those involved. The judge is seeking a way to provide due process to the men, who were given little more than 24 hours' notice of their removal from the United States, while the flight's path was tracked from Texas to Ireland and then to Djibouti.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Moody's credit rating downgrade and market volatility are being attributed to concerns over the U.S. debt-and-deficit situation and President Trump's proposed spending bill. The bill's potential to increase the $36.2 trillion national debt and widen the budget deficit is raising investor risk premiums, leading to higher Treasury yields, particularly for the 10-year note and 30-year bond. Experts warn that the deficit, projected to reach 6.5%-7% of GDP, is unsustainable in the long term, while the bill's provisions, such as making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, could exacerbate fiscal problems. Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research suggests that the bond market anticipates these issues, potentially leading to higher interest rates and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The gift has also sparked questions about Qatar's motives and whether the plane could contain listening devices. The Air Force is preparing to award a contract for the modifications, but the cost and timeline remain unclear, and Congress has not yet formally approved the gift.</p>

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, leading to concerns from budget hawks, while Democrats uniformly oppose the legislation, citing benefits for the rich and unfair punishment for lower-income Americans.</p>

The Eagles and several other teams voted against the ban, with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie delivering a "passionate but fair" speech in defense of the play. The "tush push," also known as "The Brotherly Shove," involves pushing the quarterback forward for short yardage, and the Eagles have been notably successful with it, converting 39 of 48 attempts in the 2024 season.</p>

          <p>The FDA's new framework for COVID-19 vaccines may effectively end the option for healthy children to receive their initial series of COVID vaccines, as it requires new clinical trials to prove the shots' worth for those under 65. This decision comes as Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new vaccine czar, has long argued against COVID shots for kids, citing limited benefits. Experts warn this could leave children vulnerable to the virus without protection, while the FDA's lack of explicit policy addressing the primary vaccine series for kids creates uncertainty about future access.</p>

The ruling, made by Judge David Joseph, found that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The decision undermines bipartisan support for the law, which aims to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers, and comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to reshape the EEOC and its policies.</p>
