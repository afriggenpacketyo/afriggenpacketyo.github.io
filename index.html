          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large military parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade is expected to involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The Army emphasizes the event is to celebrate its 250th birthday, but the timing has raised speculation about Trump's involvement. The cost is unclear, but concerns have been raised about infrastructure damage from heavy vehicles, with city officials requiring reimbursement for any repairs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines will reduce its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by canceling 35 roundtrip flights daily, which constitutes about 10% of its Newark schedule. CEO Scott Kirby attributes these disruptions to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and the FAA's technology issues, reporting that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers "walked off the job" following technology failures. Kirby urges the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. He also praised the Trump administration for its commitment to investing in and upgrading the nation's aging air traffic control infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The London Marathon ballot highlights the increasing popularity of running in the UK, with over one million people entering the 2026 ballot, contrasting with just over 7,000 participants in the inaugural 1981 race. This surge mirrors a broader trend toward physical activity, as indicated by Sport England's Active Lives survey. Elite runner Phily Bowden emphasizes running's positive impact on mental health and its integration into people's routines. The growth in running clubs and social media sharing is expected to sustain this trend, solidifying running as a lasting component of British culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Radio Free Asia (RFA) is implementing mass layoffs, potentially shutting down language services, due to funding cuts by the Trump administration. This decision follows Trump's directive to reduce unnecessary governmental entities and the subsequent termination of congressionally-appropriated grants by a senior advisor. A federal judge initially ordered the reinstatement of funds, but a D.C. appeals court granted an administrative stay, freezing that order. RFA, which broadcasts in languages like Burmese and Mandarin to approximately 60 million listeners weekly, views this as a critical blow to its mission of providing news to repressive societies.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has launched a campaign targeting House Republicans, accusing them of planning to cut Medicaid, prompting strong reactions from Republicans who deny these claims. Republicans argue that the Democrats are spreading misinformation and are actually trying to protect taxpayer-funded benefits for undocumented immigrants. The DNC plans to pressure these Republicans through social media, town halls, and direct contact to prevent them from supporting budget cuts to Medicaid. Despite assurances from the White House that entitlements will not be touched, Democrats are warning that Medicaid cuts are a losing issue for Republicans.</p>

          <p>DÃ©a Kulumbegashvili's film "April" delves into the life of Nina, an obstetrician in Georgia, following a tragedy in the delivery room and an investigation into her private abortions. The film eschews traditional thriller elements to explore Nina's oppressive gloom and her dedication to serving women in a conservative society. Sukhitashvili's performance portrays Nina as emotionally distant, her actions often inscrutable, and the film uses visual and auditory cues to convey her internal stress. "April" is a haunting exploration of a woman's retreat from life while improving the lives of others.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking emergency intervention from the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive data held by the Social Security Administration (SSA). This action follows a lower court's injunction that restricted DOGE's access to protect millions of Americans' personal information. The administration argues that this access is essential for modernizing government systems and preventing fraud, while opponents claim it violates privacy laws. The legal battle underscores ongoing tensions between government efficiency efforts and individual privacy rights.</p>

While the film captures the essence of the original story, the dialogue feels too self-aware, undermining the recklessness and delusion of the characters.
