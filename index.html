          <p>The UK has initiated a nationwide rollout of a gonorrhoea vaccine, a world-first effort to combat unprecedented infection levels. Initially targeting high-risk groups, the program utilizes the 4CMenB vaccine, originally for meningitis B, which is 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea. Health officials hope this will curb the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains and alleviate pressure on sexual health services, as 2023 saw over 85,000 cases, the highest in nearly a century. The move is praised by charities as a significant advancement in public sexual health.</p>

          <p>May Davis Mailman, a long-serving Trump administration insider, has resigned from her role as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist. Considered the highest-ranking official to leave the second term voluntarily, she will transition to a special government employee to finalize ongoing policy work. Mailman, known for her close ties to Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, plans to start her own government affairs firm. Her departure marks the loss of a seasoned official who was instrumental in the operational setup of the administration.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 30 Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled the state for Illinois to prevent a vote on a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. This maneuver denies the state legislature the necessary quorum to proceed with the vote, which could create five new Republican-leaning districts. The Democrats accuse the GOP of a "cowardly" effort to gerrymander districts at Donald Trump's behest, while Republicans argue the new map is legally and politically fair. The protesting lawmakers face potential daily fines and arrest for their absence.</p>

          <p>Russia's Krasheninnikov volcano, located on the Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles high. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck the region, prompting speculation about a potential connection between the seismic events. While an aviation alert was issued, there are no populated areas in the plume's path, and no ashfall has been reported in inhabited localities. Officials state the volcano's activity is now decreasing but moderate explosive activity could continue.</p>

U.S. officials confirmed the death and stated that the fires were reportedly set by settlers on homes and vehicles in the area. This incident is the latest in a series of violent events involving settlers and Palestinians, highlighting the escalating tensions in the region since the October 7th Hamas attack. The U.S. State Department condemned the "criminal violence" and is providing consular assistance to the family as Israeli police investigate.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats reportedly negotiated for the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees before the August recess. The negotiations, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, sought funding for agencies like the NIH and various international aid programs. However, the deal ultimately fell apart after President Trump rejected the terms, accusing Democrats of "political extortion." Consequently, only a handful of nominees were confirmed, leaving around 140 others, including key ambassadorial posts, waiting until at least September.</p>

          <p>A tragic shipwreck in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Yemen has resulted in the deaths of at least 68 African migrants, with another 74 still missing and presumed dead. The vessel, which was carrying 154 Ethiopian migrants, capsized early Sunday, with only 12 survivors reported by the UN's International Organization for Migration. This incident highlights the extreme dangers faced by migrants attempting to reach Gulf Arab countries via the perilous sea route through war-torn Yemen. It is the latest in a series of deadly shipwrecks that have claimed hundreds of lives in recent months.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey, retreat. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the restricted area. This was one of five unauthorized airspace incursions over the weekend, prompting officials to remind general aviation pilots to check for flight restriction notices (NOTAMs) before every flight. NORAD emphasized that such intercepts are conducted with the highest regard for safety.</p>

Greer defended the administration's strategy as a necessary step to rebalance trade and bring manufacturing back to the U.S., even as economists predict the tariffs will slow economic growth.

The local council previously rejected the plan, but the UK government has taken over the decision, signaling a potential approval amid a complex diplomatic relationship.

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity as a way for women to preserve fertility, but the procedure comes with significant financial burdens and no guarantee of success. A single cycle can cost between $12,000 and $13,000, with many women undergoing multiple cycles to increase their chances, and most paying out-of-pocket. Fertility experts caution that success is not assured, as there is a drop-off at each stage from thawing the egg to a successful birth. Despite the expense and uncertainty, many women view it as a valuable "insurance policy" that provides peace of mind and more control over their reproductive timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this figure represents a steep 66% drop from its debut, a larger decline than seen with previous Marvel films. The weekend's new releases, the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" and the reboot "The Naked Gun," secured the second and third spots, respectively. Analysts noted the surprisingly sharp fall for the superhero film given its positive reviews, suggesting a challenging start to the month for the summer box office.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending the abrupt firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a jobs report showed downward revisions for previous months. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pointed to the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the dismissal, though without providing specific proof of the "rigged" data President Trump alleged. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and politicians, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent. Critics argue the administration is "shooting the messenger" for politically inconvenient economic numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

Police have identified the suspect as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown and the victims as barmaid Nancy Lauretta Kelley and three customers. Authorities describe the suspect as an "unstable individual" who is believed to be armed and dangerous, prompting a search involving around 250 law enforcement officers across the dense, mountainous terrain.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new court filing, Trump administration attorneys have formally denied that a daily quota for immigration arrests exists, directly contradicting previous public statements from White House officials. Senior adviser Stephen Miller had previously stated the administration was "looking to set a goal" of at least 3,000 arrests per day. The Justice Department's filing, part of a lawsuit over immigration enforcement tactics, claims that while the goal may have been discussed, no such policy or directive has been issued to ICE. This discrepancy raises questions about the administration's internal versus public messaging on its aggressive deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>Florida has unexpectedly overtaken California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven largely by economic factors rather than climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the charge, taking advantage of streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the falling cost of solar compared to natural gas. However, this growth faces headwinds from the impending rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. The state's continued reliance on natural gas and emerging grid constraints also pose challenges to its long-term solar momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years on people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal immigration services. This new measure aims to give law enforcement more tools to combat gangs that promote dangerous English Channel crossings online. According to the Home Office, a significant majority of the record 25,000 migrants who have crossed this year used social media to contact smugglers. The Labour government is facing pressure to address the "small boats" crisis and views this as a key step in disrupting the smugglers' business model.</p>
