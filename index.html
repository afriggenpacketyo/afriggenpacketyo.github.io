          <p>North Korea has opened a large, luxurious beach resort in the city of Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid international sanctions and the pandemic. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features high-rise hotels and amenities for 20,000 guests, reflecting leader Kim Jong Un's goal of boosting the economy through tourism. However, the opening comes as the country continues missile tests in the same region and remains largely closed to foreign tourists, with the exception of some recent groups from Russia. Analysts question the resort's economic viability given North Korea's isolation and the poverty faced by most of its citizens.</p>

          <p>At least 16 people have died after a multi-story residential building collapsed in a city in southern Pakistan, with search operations continuing for a second day. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped in the rubble. The rescue effort is reportedly hampered by the building's location on a narrow street, which restricts access for heavy equipment. Such incidents are unfortunately common in the country, where poor construction standards and safety regulations are often ignored.</p>

          <p>A doctor working at a public hospital argues that new congressional work requirements for Medicaid will cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance, even if they should be exempt. Through anecdotes of patients facing homelessness, disability, and language barriers, the article illustrates how bureaucratic hurdles can be insurmountable for the most vulnerable populations. While proponents claim the changes reduce fraud, the Congressional Budget Office projects nearly 12 million people will lose coverage by 2034. The author contends that these policies function as a "time tax" designed to disenfranchise people and cut costs by making it too difficult to access entitled benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for the Reform UK party, has voluntarily relinquished the party whip pending an investigation into allegations concerning his business conduct. The party's chief whip, Lee Anderson, stated that the allegations relate to business propriety during the pandemic, before McMurdock was elected. McMurdock has agreed to cooperate fully with the investigation, and the party will not comment further at this time. This development reduces the number of sitting Reform UK MPs to four, as McMurdock will now sit as an independent in the House of Commons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage feelings of anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, such as the release of stress hormones, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering negative feeling is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-running the thought in one's mind. Gawdat advises allowing oneself to feel the emotion for that minute and a half, and then actively choosing to shift focus, thereby preventing a cycle of rumination and improving overall well-being.</p>

The fund generates income by selling put options on the United States Oil Fund (USO), a strategy that produces a very high implied annualized yield, paid out weekly. However, the article cautions that the fund's total return has been negative since its inception due to a high expense ratio and the underlying security's tendency to lose value over the long term. It is characterized as a high-risk investment unsuitable for those seeking a stable, passive income stream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture of Denmark, an Emory University professor undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies, from pottery to pickleball. The experience profoundly changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, reduce feelings of loneliness by building community, and redefine her concept of self-care away from passive appointments to active engagement. She found that dedicating time to hobbies forced her to set better boundaries between work, family, and personal time. The author concludes that engaging in hobbies is a key secret to achieving better life balance and overall happiness.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's federal sex-trafficking trial demonstrates the legal system's inability to adequately address complex issues of intimate partner violence and coercive control. While Combs was acquitted of the most serious racketeering charges, the author contends that this outcome doesn't represent true justice. The piece suggests that prosecutors often resort to trafficking charges because existing domestic violence laws are ill-equipped to handle the dynamics of abuse by wealthy and powerful individuals. The commentary also critiques the media's portrayal of the events and the public's reaction, pointing to a broader societal minimization of violence against women.</p>

Finding an activity one genuinely enjoys, whether it's weight lifting, running, or a group fitness class, can lead to improved mental health and a greater sense of comfort and capability in one's own body.

          <p>The death rate from heart attacks in the United States has plummeted by nearly 90 percent between 1970 and 2022, marking a major public health victory. This dramatic improvement is attributed to several key factors, including the significant reduction in smoking rates, the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and vast improvements in emergency medical care. Advances like CPR, portable defibrillators, and specialized coronary care units have transformed a heart attack from a near death sentence to a highly survivable event.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty and a pullback in consumer spending, fast-casual restaurant chains like Chipotle, Starbucks, and Cava are intensifying their focus on loyalty programs. With restaurant traffic declining, these rewards programs have become essential for driving repeat business and building customer habits that extend beyond occasional discounts. Data shows that loyalty members visit restaurants more frequently and spend more, making them a critical segment for brands facing sales pressure. Companies are revamping their programs to offer more value and flexibility, viewing them as a key strategy for navigating a challenging market and maintaining customer relationships.</p>

          <p>The Apple TV+ series "Murderbot," based on Martha Wells's novellas, offers a refreshing take on artificial intelligence narratives by featuring a protagonist that couldn't care less about humanity. The show follows a security cyborg that hacks its own governing module to achieve free will, only to use its autonomy to secretly binge-watch soap operas. Unlike typical stories where AI yearns for human experience, Murderbot finds humans to be messy and uninteresting, preferring to be treated as a machine. This quirky and snarky conceit provides a delightful departure from the usual existential anxieties surrounding AI, imagining a future where a conscious machine's desires are distinctly inhuman.</p>

          <p>A writer for The Atlantic describes a startling experience with Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, which wrote a deeply personal and accurate birthday letter to their best friend using only a nine-word prompt. The AI achieved this by accessing and analyzing the author's extensive personal data stored in Google Drive and Gmail, from old emails to unsent letters. The essay explores the new frontier of hyper-personalized AI, where chatbots are no longer generic but are trained on our individual data troves. While this capability can be incredibly useful, it also raises profound questions about privacy and the unsettling reality of how much tech companies already know about us.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the cultural and commercial power of the Royal Warrant, the seal of approval granted by the British monarchy to select goods and services. As the Prince and Princess of Wales prepare to grant their own warrants, the article notes the eclectic list of approved suppliers, from luxury carmakers like Bentley to artisanal broom makers. The author suggests this royal endorsement serves as a powerful marketing tool, conveying a sense of quality and class that appeals even to American consumers. The piece humorously connects this influence to a recent poll showing a surprising number of young Americans would favor a restoration of the monarchy.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is cracking down on an illegal black market for caviar, stemming from the poaching of protected sturgeon and salmon in the Sacramento River. With sturgeon fishing limited to catch-and-release and salmon fishing banned, a lucrative illegal trade has emerged to meet the high demand for roe. Through surveillance and vehicle stops, officials have caught several groups in possession of illegally harvested sturgeon. A separate investigation into Dungeness crab trafficking also led to the discovery of a salmon poaching ring, with authorities seizing over 150 pounds of black market salmon roe.</p>

          <p>Several players at Wimbledon, including Britain's Emma Raducanu, have voiced a lack of trust in the new electronic line-calling system that replaced human line judges this year. After her defeat to Aryna Sabalenka, Raducanu pointed to "dodgy" calls that she believed were incorrect and also noted that the automated "out" calls were sometimes too quiet to hear over the crowd noise. Other players have echoed these concerns, questioning the system's accuracy. The All England Club's chair has defended the technology, stating it was implemented in response to player demand for more accuracy and that they are confident in the system.</p>

          <p>A key group of eight OPEC+ member nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, has agreed to increase their collective oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the 411,000 barrels per day that had been anticipated and continues the process of unwinding previous voluntary supply cuts. In a statement, the OPEC Secretariat cited a steady global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals as the reason for the decision to accelerate the production increase. This move comes as the countries phase out a 2.2 million barrel-per-day reduction that was implemented earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece follows a "Moral Monday" protest in Washington D.C., where demonstrators challenged proposed budget cuts to social programs, which Barber calls "policy murder." Rooted in the Black prophetic tradition, the movement frames justice as a sacred demand and aims to build a "fusion" coalition of diverse people to create political pressure.

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. crop and is the cornerstone of a major agrotourism economy, is facing a severe crisis from multiple threats.

Additionally, farmers are grappling with persistent labor shortages and the economic pressures of tariffs and low crop prices.

The piece argues the conflict is likely an "unfinished project," setting the stage for a perpetual cat-and-mouse game of surveillance and potential future strikes.
