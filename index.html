          <p>Social media giant Reddit has filed a lawsuit against AI company Perplexity, accusing it of illegally scraping user posts to train its AI models. This action highlights an escalating conflict between content owners and the artificial intelligence industry over data rights. Reddit claims Perplexity, along with data scrapers, masked identities to extract copyrighted content, becoming a primary source for AI-generated answers. Perplexity denies the allegations, calling the suit "extortion" and arguing it only summarizes public discussions, not trains AI models on the content.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's commitment to more forcefully intercept small boats crossing the English Channel is reportedly facing delays due to internal political instability. Despite UK government frustration and previous promises of a new "maritime doctrine" to pull boats back to shore, sources indicate these plans are not materializing. Concerns about safety, potential legal implications for security forces, and a lack of equipment and personnel are cited as major obstacles. Meanwhile, dangerously overcrowded boats continue to depart daily, with volunteers expressing exasperation at the ongoing situation.</p>

          <p>As China concludes its fourth plenum, the Communist Party's official newspaper has lauded the nation's socialist system as a fundamental source of strength for its economy and a provider of global stability. The article emphasizes the party's scientific and consistent approach to five-year plans as a core political advantage. It contrasts China's unified national strategy with other countries' short-term policymaking, asserting that decisive actions ensure China's economic resilience and steady progress. This narrative reinforces the party's governance model as superior and essential for development.</p>

Additionally, new NHS check-up questions for women over 40 about menopause aim to raise awareness, and a unique collaboration between Agatha Christie and Mr. Men books is announced.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old Indian national, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022, has been arrested for driving under the influence following a deadly eight-vehicle collision on a Southern California freeway.

          <p>A former Chinese official policy adviser has urged China to liberate itself from Western "discourse traps" on issues like state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. He emphasized the need to challenge perceived "double standards" regarding China's rise while confidently defending the Communist Party's rule. The adviser warned that merely reacting defensively to Western provocations is unlikely to persuade Western societies and risks alienating Global South countries. This suggests a strategic shift in how China communicates its narrative on the international stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has begun demolishing parts of the White House East Wing to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, estimated to cost $300 million and privately funded. This project, which will significantly expand the White House's footprint, has drawn strong criticism from historians, preservationists, and politicians who object to altering the historic residence. Concerns also persist regarding the opaque nature of the private funding, with one known donor being YouTube as part of a legal settlement. Critics question the timing and necessity of such an opulent project amidst national economic struggles.</p>

          <p>Food insecurity is a growing concern in rural America, exemplified by struggling mobile food banks in places like Clinton, Missouri, where demand has doubled. Rising inflation and over $1 billion in federal food aid cuts have led to fewer donations for organizations like Harvesters, which serves nearly 375,000 people daily. The ongoing government shutdown further threatens SNAP payments, exacerbating the crisis. The Trump administration's cancellation of the annual USDA report on food insecurity also hinders efforts to address the problem, leaving many operating "in the dark" about the true scope of need.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are making strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells" that can later spread cancer throughout the body. A clinical trial, co-led by Dr. Angela DeMichele, identified these lurking cells in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who was diagnosed with aggressive triple-negative breast cancer. After drug treatments, doctors were thrilled to find no dormant cells in her bone marrow. The trial showed promising results, with only two out of 51 women experiencing recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate.</p>

          <p>Lebanon is facing the world's fastest rising rates of cancer cases and deaths, with new cases increasing by 162% and deaths by 80% between 1990 and 2023. A global survey attributes this dramatic surge to factors like severe air pollution from vehicles and diesel generators, overuse of agricultural chemicals, and widespread smoking. Lung, leukemia, pancreatic, and liver cancers are on the rise, while preventable prostate, colon, and breast cancers are also increasing due to a lack of health education and screening awareness.

          <p>Global oil prices surged by approximately 3% after the Trump administration imposed additional sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The Treasury Secretary cited Moscow's "lack of serious commitment to a peace process" in Ukraine as the reason for the move, aiming to hinder the Kremlin's war funding. Brent crude rose to $64.42 per barrel, while U.S. crude reached $60.24. This market reaction underscores the immediate economic impact of geopolitical actions, especially given that U.S. crude oil prices had fallen 16% this year prior to the sanctions.
