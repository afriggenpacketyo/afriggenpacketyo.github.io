He quickly rediscovered his form to secure the win and will now face Britain's Dan Evans, continuing his quest for a record-breaking 25th major title at the tournament.</p>

          <p>Following the Senate's passage of a massive tax and spending bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson now faces a significant challenge in securing enough Republican votes for its approval. Several conservative members have publicly voiced their opposition to the Senate's version, citing its higher spending levels and debt ceiling increase compared to the bill the House originally passed. With a razor-thin majority, Johnson can only afford to lose a few votes, and the outcome is further complicated by potential member attendance issues and a looming self-imposed July 4th deadline from the President.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Republican spending bill reveals that its proposed cuts to Medicaid could lead to severe consequences for public health and healthcare infrastructure. The legislation would slash over $1 trillion from the program, largely by implementing strict new work requirements and limiting states' ability to fund their programs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates these changes would cause nearly 12 million people to become uninsured by 2034, while also threatening the financial viability of many rural hospitals that heavily rely on Medicaid funding to operate.</p>

However, the jurors stated they were deadlocked on the most serious charge, racketeering conspiracy. The judge has instructed them to continue deliberating to try and reach a unanimous decision on the remaining count. The high-profile trial included weeks of graphic testimony from witnesses, including Combs' former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, alleging a pattern of violence and abuse.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new law that significantly expands its anti-smoking regulations by banning smoking in most public outdoor areas. The ban applies to spaces such as beaches, public parks, forests, and areas surrounding schools, with violators facing fines of up to 700 euros. The French government hopes the measure will "denormalize" smoking and reduce its prevalence, particularly among young people, as the country still has one of the highest smoking rates in Europe despite earlier bans.</p>

The legislation, which the CBO estimates will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt over a decade, now returns to the House of Representatives for a final, challenging vote before it can be sent to the president's desk.</p>
