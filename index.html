          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding billions in transportation funding from states that don't cooperate with federal immigration authorities.  Twenty states sued, arguing the administration lacked the legal authority to tie transportation funds to immigration enforcement. The judge agreed, stating the policy was arbitrary and lacked specificity regarding cooperation requirements. This decision halts the administration's attempt to pressure states into complying with its immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Ryan Ferguson, wrongfully convicted of murder and imprisoned for nearly a decade, was awarded over $43 million by a Missouri judge.  His 2005 conviction was overturned in 2013 after a key witness recanted their testimony.  Ferguson's subsequent federal civil rights lawsuit against Columbia and police officers resulted in an initial $11 million award, but the insurer was ordered to pay the additional sum due to the officers' limited financial capacity. This significant award provides some measure of justice for his wrongful imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate hit 3.7% in May, its highest since January 2023, exceeding economist expectations and increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates.  This rise, exceeding the BOJ's 2% target for the 38th consecutive month, is fueled by factors such as spiking rice prices. The central bank, however, maintains its current rate while forecasting a future slowdown in inflation.  This situation presents a challenge for the BOJ in balancing inflation control with economic growth.</p>
