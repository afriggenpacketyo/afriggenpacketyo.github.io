        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the Southern Poverty Law Center indicates that white nationalist hate group Patriot Front uses combat sport clubs, known as Active Clubs, to recruit new members. These clubs, present in at least 34 states, involve training in mixed martial arts and promoting white nationalist ideologies online. The report highlights the group's efforts to maintain a low profile and evade law enforcement, with recruitment challenges arising from the clubs' scattered and unaffiliated nature. Patriot Front has faced controversies, including lawsuits and internal scrutiny, leading them to use Active Clubs to groom members. The report emphasizes the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and hateful beliefs, broadening the reach of extremist groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings has downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over increasing government debt and rising interest costs. This decision aligns Moody's with other rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which had previously downgraded the U.S. The downgrade reflects a lack of agreement on measures to reverse large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs, with potential implications for Treasury yields and investor sentiment. Moody's analysts anticipate widening federal deficits and a rising federal debt burden, particularly if the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended. This situation is further complicated by decreasing foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional data from the CDC showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. This widespread trend is evident in 45 states, particularly in Ohio and West Virginia, and is largely attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement cash. While synthetic opioid deaths are falling rapidly, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are on the rise, and some regions remain highly vulnerable. Concerns remain over proposed cuts to naloxone distribution, which could hinder further progress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering several policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure, declaring it an ‚ÄúEssential Health Benefit‚Äù under the Affordable Care Act, and pushing Congress to pass a law mandating private insurance coverage. White House officials have been meeting with infertility doctors, industry leaders, and conservative policy groups to discuss these proposals. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has criticized the White House for not including them in the discussions. The administration aims to address infertility issues holistically, balancing the interests of various groups within its base.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto, now with the New York Mets after signing a 15-year, $765 million contract, faced a hostile reception from Yankees fans during his return to Yankee Stadium. Despite his previous popularity with the Yankees, fans booed him at every at-bat, with some altering his old jerseys to show their displeasure. The Subway Series game, a clash between two first-place teams, saw the Yankees defeat the Mets 6-2, although Soto had a decent performance with three walks, a stolen base, and a run scored. The Yankees used the money that could have gone to Soto to instead fill holes around the roster with additions from baseball's B list.</p>

Players have already discovered ways to manipulate the AI to utter profanities by repeating offensive language. The game offers a reporting feature for such incidents and requires parental permission for players under 13 to interact with the character.</p>

Wind tunnel tests show that plasma generated by high-voltage currents can boost an aircraft wing‚Äôs lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 per cent, which indicates a superior flight efficiency. This technology has the potential for extending the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, allowing them to fly longer than before.

While neo-shamanism has been absorbed by the therapeutic Western self, it also finds expression in art and music, providing new containers for the shamanic otherworld.

          <p>Hollywood is facing an existential panic as film production increasingly moves overseas due to aggressive tax incentives and cheaper labor. President Trump's proposal of tariffs on foreign-produced movies sparked debate about revitalizing the American film industry, with unions expressing support for efforts to increase domestic production. A plan drafted by Jon Voight suggests federal rebates and tariffs on productions using overseas tax breaks, along with a cultural test for subsidized projects. The lack of protectionism has contributed to job losses in Los Angeles, but tariffs could also discourage studios from undertaking projects due to increased costs.</p>

          <p>An allegedly "unofficial" copy of the Magna Carta, acquired by Harvard Law School for $27.50 in 1946, has been confirmed as an original from the year 1300. Professors at King's College London and the University of East Anglia used spectral imaging and ultraviolet light to authenticate the document. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people, including royalty, had personal rights and was reissued by subsequent monarchs. The true wealth of the Magna Carta lies in its principles of individual rights and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Audio snippets from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden, conducted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur, have emerged, highlighting Biden's memory lapses and halting speech. The recordings, obtained by Axios, feature Biden struggling to recall dates and events, including the year of his son Beau's death. Hur's report, released in February 2024, described Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory," leading to criticism from Biden and his allies. The release of the audio has reignited concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, especially after a rocky debate against Trump.</p>

Nissan plans to focus on boosting sales of U.S.-manufactured models to cushion the tariff's effect. The U.S. market remains crucial for Japanese automakers despite the challenges.
