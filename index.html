          <p>Israel initiated a series of strikes against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and military commanders, asserting it as a preemptive measure to neutralize Iran's nuclear capabilities. The strikes, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," have led to a state of emergency in Israel, with warnings of potential retaliatory attacks. Iranian state media reported the deaths of key military figures, including the chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and nuclear scientists. Oil prices surged, and U.S. stock futures declined amidst fears of broader regional conflict, while the U.S. distanced itself from the operation, emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that Israel's recent attack on Iran occurred despite growing tension between Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump, who preferred to wait for US-led nuclear negotiations. Israel believed it had an opportune moment to act, considering Iran's regional vulnerabilities. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio distanced the US from the "unilateral action," emphasizing the protection of American forces. The US officials had briefed that there would be no American support in the event of Israeli action.</p>

          <p>According to an expert from the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. The expert noted that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. The expert added that long-term demand for gold is supported by concerns over US dollar assets, trade tensions, and the economic impact of tariffs. The comments were made amidst growing market interest in digital currencies and a rise in gold prices due to Middle East tensions and a weakening US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay on a lower court's order that would have required President Trump to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The appeals court set a hearing for June 17, meaning the National Guard will remain federalized through the weekend. The initial order stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Newsom challenging Trump's deployment of the National Guard in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The Trump administration argued the mobilization was legal under Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Forces.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic analyzes Israel's recent attack on Iran, questioning whether it constitutes a preemptive strike or a preventive war. The article distinguishes between preemptive attacks, which thwart imminent threats, and preventive wars, which remove potential future threats. It suggests Israel's actions may be a preventive war, which carries moral and practical risks, but could be justified given Iran's history and threats towards Israel. The article draws parallels to historical examples of preventive actions and argues Israel may be aiming to eliminate the existential threat from Iran.</p>

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay while it considers the administration's appeal, scheduling a hearing for June 17. The initial ruling had found that California officials were likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests, arguing that Trump had overstepped his authority.
