          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, along with leaders from France, Britain, and Poland, visited Kyiv to advocate for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, starting the following Monday, to facilitate peace negotiations. Merz warned Russia of harsher sanctions if it rejects the truce, emphasizing continued political, financial, and military support for Ukraine. The leaders coordinated with US President Donald Trump, who also supports the ceasefire proposal, placing pressure on Putin to respond positively to the offer.

          <p>The United States and China have commenced high-level discussions in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, marking the first in-person contact since President Donald Trump imposed substantial tariffs on imports earlier in the year. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are engaging with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to address the ongoing tariff war. China faces tariffs of at least 145 percent on exports to the U.S., while retaliatory duties on American goods have risen to 125 percent. Trump has hinted at potentially lowering the tariff rate against China.</p>

          <p>As the United States reduces its support for Ukraine, European allies are finding it difficult to provide the necessary weapons, leading Ukraine to seek revenue-sharing deals with the U.S. for natural resources. European nations are attempting to ramp up their own weapons production, but experts predict it will take at least a decade to meet the required capacity. Despite Trump's recent alignment with Ukraine on sanctions, his broader stance has prompted European nations to rethink their security strategies, potentially diverting resources from aiding Ukraine.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances, potentially enabling policymakers to craft more effective legislation and allowing for further clinical research on medical cannabis. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill, which would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that restrict federal funds from being used for research on Schedule I substances. Experts suggest the bill has the potential to attract bipartisan support, prioritizing evidence over ideology and facilitating a more informed approach to cannabis policy. Despite some skepticism, proponents believe the bill is a vital step toward shaping smart cannabis policy.</p>
