          <p>Amazon refuted reports that it would display tariff costs alongside product prices on its main website, clarifying that such a plan was only considered for its Amazon Haul site. This denial followed strong criticism from the White House, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt labeling the reported plan as a "hostile and political act," questioning why Amazon didn't highlight inflation during the Biden administration and referencing a past partnership with a Chinese propaganda arm. Amazon's CEO has said they'll do everything to keep prices low, and communicate with the Trump administration. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding trade and tariffs.

          <p>Renée Richards, a transgender sports pioneer, expresses concerns about the Trump administration's restrictions on transgender rights, particularly the ban on transgender Americans serving openly in the military. While Richards believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports, she is critical of broader restrictions affecting transgender rights in areas like passports, education, and healthcare. She feels the debate over transgender athletes has fueled a broader backlash against transgender rights. Richards suggests Trump is catering to a small group of people who oppose transgender rights.

Sanctions, particularly US-led restrictions, deter investment in Iran's energy infrastructure, hindering its ability to supply gas to Europe.
