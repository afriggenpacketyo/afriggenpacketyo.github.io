          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reported threats from Hamas, which the militant group denied, adding to the chaos surrounding aid delivery. The United Nations has warned that Gazans are still far from receiving the necessary food supplies. This situation highlights the complexities of providing humanitarian assistance in conflict zones, where political tensions and security concerns can significantly impede relief efforts. The challenges in coordinating aid distribution underscore the urgent need for a stable and secure environment to ensure that essential resources reach those in need. The lack of food security for Gazans remains a critical issue. Optimism for near-term solutions is low.</p>

          <p>Following violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement over immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, President Trump ordered the National Guard to the city. Protests erupted after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted operations across L.A. County, leading to multiple arrests and injuries to federal officers. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and accused Trump of illegally activating the National Guard, announcing plans to sue the administration. The situation has drawn responses from various political figures, including Kamala Harris and Maxine Waters, who condemned the deployment as an escalation. The situation in Los Angeles remains tense as authorities work to quell the unrest.</p>

Experts contend that the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and better screening. They fear that Kennedy's focus on external toxins could hinder genetic research that has facilitated the development of promising new therapies.
