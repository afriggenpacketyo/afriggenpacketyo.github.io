            <p>Saturday's newspapers highlight a range of stories, including a surge in misogyny and racism in UK schools attributed to students imitating figures like Donald Trump and Andrew Tate, according to a NASUWT union survey. Other headlines include government plans to send rejected asylum seekers to 'return hubs' in the Balkans, endorsed by the UN refugee agency, and a royal author promising 'sensational revelations' about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's relationship. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement of extended pub hours for VE Day celebrations also features prominently, alongside Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasizing the importance of UK-China trade ties. Finally, a defense review is set to advise expanding the UK's military presence in the Arctic.</p>

            <p>China's museums are being directed to promote ethnic unity and counter 'wrong historical views,' according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums should avoid portraying confrontational historical contexts between the Han ethnicity and ethnic minorities, and instead focus on telling the 'China story' through archaeological findings. This initiative aims to cultivate a 'sense of community' and represent China as 'diverse but unified,' emphasizing respect and accommodation of differences. The Sanxingdui Museum has already implemented a course titled 'Viewing Chinese Civilisation from Sanxingdui' to align with this directive.</p>

            <p>US airstrikes on a Houthi-controlled oil terminal on Yemen's Red Sea coast reportedly killed dozens and wounded many more, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The US military stated the strikes targeted the Ras Isa facility to degrade the Houthis' economic resources and restrict their ability to generate revenue. The Houthi government condemned the attack as a 'war crime,' asserting the terminal was a civilian facility. In response, thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to protest the strikes, while the US military defended its actions as necessary to combat Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel.</p>

            <p>A new poll by the NASUWT teaching union reveals that social media influencers are contributing to a rise in misogyny and sexism in schools. Almost three in five teachers believe social media negatively impacts student behavior, with Andrew Tate specifically named by several teachers. Teachers shared instances of students echoing Tate's views on women, leading to parental concern and classroom challenges. The Department for Education acknowledges the 'damaging impact' of dangerous influencers and is supporting teachers in addressing the issue.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump posted an image that appears to be digitally altered, claiming it shows an MS-13 tattoo on the hand of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's deportation is under legal scrutiny, with courts demanding his return to the US. Trump alleges Abrego Garcia is a gang member, despite lacking evidence, and criticizes Democrats for supporting his return. Social media users have questioned the authenticity of the image, while a senator who met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador accused the Salvadoran government of staging the meeting to portray Abrego Garcia favorably.</p>

            <p>The ACLU has petitioned the US Supreme Court to temporarily block the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members under a wartime law. This action follows the transfer of detainees to a Texas facility and reports of imminent deportations to El Salvador, where similar deportations have previously occurred. The ACLU argues that the detainees are being denied due process and a chance to challenge their cases. While a lower court judge denied the request, citing a lack of authority, the Supreme Court and other appellate courts are still considering the matter.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the term 'woman' legally refers to a biological woman, providing clarity after years of debate. This ruling means that single-sex spaces, such as changing rooms and women's refuges, are intended for biological women only. The decision has been met with contrasting reactions, with some celebrating it as a victory for common sense and others expressing devastation. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is expected to release detailed guidance to clarify the practical implications of the ruling.</p>

            <p>Artists are protesting against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate images of people as dolls, expressing concerns about its impact on their livelihoods. The #StarterPackNoAI movement has emerged as a counter-trend, with artists sharing their own handmade creations. Creatives worry that AI-generated images devalue artistic skill, threaten intellectual property rights, and could reduce their client base. While some acknowledge the potential usefulness of AI, they emphasize the importance of human creativity and originality.</p>

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham has led to uncollected waste accumulating in densely populated, poorer areas, while wealthier areas remain relatively unaffected. This disparity has fueled accusations of a two-tier waste collection system. Some residents have resorted to hiring private services or transporting their waste to distant sites, highlighting the strain on resources. The strike has also raised concerns about rat infestations and the overall impact on the city's reputation.</p>

            <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may "move on" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately. Deadly Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities continue, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.</p>
