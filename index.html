          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:18:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has officially announced he will remain in the New York City mayoral race as an independent candidate. This decision comes after he was decisively defeated by democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic primary. In his announcement, Cuomo stated that the primary election only represented a small fraction of the city's voters and argued that his opponent offers slogans without substantive solutions. Mamdani, who ran on a platform focused on affordability and social programs, responded with confidence, suggesting Cuomo is struggling to accept the primary results.</p>

          <p>Two major wildfires are burning on or near the Grand Canyon's North Rim, with the Dragon Bravo Fire having destroyed over 70 structures. Among the losses is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, a key visitor landmark, as well as administrative buildings and a water treatment facility. The fire's rapid growth was fueled by high winds, and a resulting chlorine gas leak from the damaged treatment plant has complicated firefighting efforts by forcing evacuations. Officials are investigating the fire management strategy, as the blaze has devastated a significant piece of Arizona's history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is set to defend its Autopilot technology in a Miami federal court in the company's first wrongful death trial concerning the system. The case stems from a 2019 crash where a Model S using Autopilot struck a parked vehicle, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs allege that design defects in the Autopilot system failed to detect the obstacle, leading to the fatal collision. Tesla maintains that the crash was caused by a distracted driver who was overriding the car's systems at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with the termination of nearly 1,400 Department of Education employees, at least for now. The court issued a temporary stay on a lower court's injunction that had blocked the mass layoffs, which are part of the administration's plan to dismantle the agency. The 6-3 decision allows the firings to continue while the legal battle proceeds through the appeals process. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the majority for enabling what she described as the executive branch's intent to break the law.</p>

          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab jumped nearly 11%, continuing a significant rally that has seen the stock almost double in the past two months. This recent surge is attributed to a series of successful rocket launches and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company, a competitor to SpaceX, has seen its stock rise 63% year-to-date, fueled by increasing demand for its Electron rocket. CEO Peter Beck stated that the company is now producing a new rocket approximately every 15 days to meet this demand. (not investment advice)</p>

This arrangement allows weapons to flow to Ukraine without direct U.S. payment, a point Trump emphasized. Concurrently, Trump threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on Russia's trading partners if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days, marking a new strategy to pressure Moscow.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to unfreeze more than $6 billion in federal education funding. The funds, allocated by Congress for programs such as after-school activities, teacher training, and support for English language learners, were abruptly halted on June 30 for a "review." The lawsuit argues that this freeze is illegal and has caused chaos for states and school districts that had already budgeted for the academic year based on the expected funds. This legal challenge is part of a broader conflict over the administration's efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that the interest-free payment pause for nearly 7.7 million federal student loan borrowers enrolled in the now-defunct SAVE plan will end on August 1. These borrowers were placed in a special forbearance after the Biden-era plan was blocked by legal challenges. With the forbearance expiring, interest will begin to accrue again, and borrowers must find a new repayment plan to avoid growing debt. The Department of Education is urging affected individuals to consider enrolling in the Income-Based Repayment plan, as the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) will not be operational until next year.</p>

Conversely, officials and pro-war bloggers in Moscow have largely dismissed Trump's accompanying threat of sanctions if a peace deal isn't reached in 50 days, calling it "hot air."

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that Donald Trump's abrupt reversal on his promise to release Jeffrey Epstein's client list has created a rare moment of disbelief among his most ardent followers. After repeatedly vowing to expose a secret cabal, Trump's new claim that the files are a Democratic-created hoax has been met with anger and confusion from his base. The Epstein saga holds a central place in the MAGA mythology, and this clumsy retconning of the narrative appears to be a step too far for many supporters. While unlikely to cause a mass defection, it marks a significant instance where Trump's power to redefine reality has been challenged.</p>

This trend is driven by a combination of high mortgage rates, rising housing inventory, and falling consumer demand. While prices are still rising in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening significantly in the South and West, with markets in Florida, Texas, and California seeing the most notable price drops from recent highs.
