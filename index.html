          <p>European golfer Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Ryder Cup singles match against Harris English of the United States due to a persistent neck injury. As a result of his withdrawal, the match was declared a half, awarding half a point to each team. This development shifts the overall score to 12-5 in favor of Europe, bringing them closer to securing the Ryder Cup. Hovland had been dealing with the neck issue for months and was unable to recover sufficiently after pulling out of a previous match on Saturday.</p>

          <p>Denmark has announced a temporary ban on all civilian drone flights following multiple sightings of unmanned aerial vehicles over military facilities and airports. The ban is a security measure ahead of an upcoming EU summit and a European Political Community meeting being hosted in the country. Danish officials have described the drone activity as a potential "hybrid attack," and while not officially assigning blame, they have noted Russia as a primary threat to European security. To bolster airspace surveillance during the high-profile political gatherings, a German air defense frigate has arrived in Copenhagen.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Ty Cobb, who served as White House Special Counsel during the first Trump administration, expressed strong criticism of the current Justice Department's actions, labeling them "wholly unconstitutional" and "authoritarian." He specifically commented on the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, predicting it lacks the substance to succeed at trial. Cobb argues that the department is no longer pursuing crimes even-handedly but is instead targeting political enemies at the behest of the President. He views these actions as part of a broader effort by Trump to rewrite history regarding his past controversies.</p>

          <p>Thousands of football fans at a Penn State game against Oregon wore "FREEDOM" T-shirts to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. The tribute was organized by conservative influencer Benny Johnson, who distributed 5,000 shirts, the same design Kirk was wearing when he was killed. The event highlights the ongoing public mourning and tribute for Kirk, whose death has been widely condemned, including by Oregon's head coach Dan Lanning. In a fitting turn for his supporters, Oregon, which was reportedly Kirk's favorite team, won the game in overtime.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at the American Fish Company, a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, resulted in three deaths and at least five injuries. Authorities reported that the shooter opened fire from a boat before fleeing the scene, but was later apprehended by the U.S. Coast Guard. The suspect, identified as Nigel Max Edge, has been arrested and faces multiple charges, including three counts of first-degree murder. Investigators believe the attack was "highly premeditated," and they have assured the public that there is no longer an active threat.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with generals and admirals at Quantico, which was called by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The meeting is considered unusual due to its large scale and the short notice given to senior military leaders summoned from around the world. While the White House has not officially commented, a source confirmed the President's attendance, which was first reported by Axios. When asked about the gathering, President Trump expressed his approval, stating he loves the idea of being "friendly with the generals and admirals."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This poem, titled "Syncretism," explores the complex relationship between a daughter and her father, who eschews traditional beliefs in God or therapy. The father finds his solace in swimming, a ritual that reveals glimpses of a past faith and buried trauma. The poem uses the powerful metaphor of a smoldering fire, originating from a cigarillo dropped by the speaker's grandfather, to represent the father's deep-seated, recurring anger that scorches his family. The speaker, observing her father's dive into the pool, contemplates forgiveness in the face of this inherited pain and silent devotion.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system, with 50.4% in favor. This vote follows a 2021 rejection of a similar proposal that raised privacy concerns due to private sector involvement. The newly approved system addresses these worries by ensuring data is stored only on users' smartphones and keeping the entire framework under government control. Supporters believe the digital ID will streamline online bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy erosion despite the enhanced safeguards.</p>

The country also has the highest obesity rates in Europe, a major risk factor for the disease. Critics argue that the Turkish health system is failing in early diagnosis and management, and call for systemic changes.</p>

The protests turned violent, resulting in at least 72 deaths, though student leaders claim the violence was instigated by outside infiltrators.

While condemning the policy, Starmer distinguished between the policy itself and Reform's supporters, suggesting their voters are frustrated with years of Conservative government failure. The comments come as the Labour Party conference begins, with Starmer facing pressure over his leadership.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, has been placed on paid administrative leave after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE alleges that Roberts is in the country illegally, lacks work authorization, and was subject to a final removal order from 2024. The Des Moines school board expressed shock at the news, stating that multiple background checks conducted before his hiring did not reveal any citizenship or immigration issues. The board is awaiting more information while the associate superintendent assumes leadership of the district.</p>

          <p>Amid skepticism about official government statistics, this article explores alternative data sources for measuring inflation, suggesting a more nuanced reality than the widely cited Consumer Price Index (CPI). Methods like the Truflation Price Index and pricing data from business groups like the ISM provide different perspectives. While some alternative indexes currently show lower inflation than the official 2.9% rate, leading indicators from business surveys suggest that price pressures are building and inflation is likely to rise in the coming months, largely due to tariffs.

          <p>China is pioneering an industrial "pull" system for its space program, aiming to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of the automotive industry. This model contrasts with the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. In the new system, final assembly "pulls" components from suppliers only when needed, which is designed to lower costs, increase flexibility, and improve quality. Chinese researchers believe mastering this scalable production method will be crucial for dominating the rapidly growing global space industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to communications expert Dr. Kate Mason, professionals often undermine their own authority and message by using self-deprecating or "minimizing" phrases. She advises against saying "It'll just take a second," as it sets unrealistic expectations and devalues the topic. She also cautions against using "No worries if not," which signals that a request is not a priority, even when it is. Finally, she recommends avoiding the preface "I'm not an expert, but...," as it instantly reduces credibility, urging professionals instead to embrace their unique expertise.</p>

          <p>An increase in shopping center vacancies, driven by the failure of large chain stores, is creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national vacancy rate rising, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties active. This shift is allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and other service-based businesses to move into prime locations that were previously unaffordable. While rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, providing a window for local entrepreneurs to reimagine these spaces.</p>

          <p>For neurodivergent individuals who may struggle with executive dysfunction, traditional financial advice can be ineffective. Financial coach Andrea Ewalefo suggests that the most impactful money move is to automate as much as possible to reduce decision fatigue. This involves setting up automatic bill payments aligned with paydays and, crucially, auto-drafting savings and investment contributions at the same time. By prioritizing these financial obligations automatically, whatever money is left can be used for free spending without the stress of potentially missing a payment or failing to save.

The terms of the settlement are confidential.

This marks another significant legal resolution for Dominion, which previously secured massive settlements from Fox News and Newsmax for their roles in amplifying the same election lies.</p>
