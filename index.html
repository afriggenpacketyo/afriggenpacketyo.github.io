        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine criticized Russia for sending a delegation lacking decision-making power to peace talks in Istanbul, deeming it a "sham." President Zelenskyy had sought direct engagement with Putin, which did not materialize, although the delegations did agree to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war. According to the article, Ukraine participated primarily out of respect for the US and Turkey, while Russia aimed to disseminate its narrative. Foreign policy experts suggest that a genuine rapprochement is unlikely until Russia faces significant economic challenges, potentially in the fall, and until the US continues to provide aid to Ukraine.</p>
