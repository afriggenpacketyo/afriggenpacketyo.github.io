          <p>Liam Byrne, a 24-year-old Scottish wingsuit flyer and British champion, tragically died during a jump in the Swiss Alps. The accident occurred on the Gitschen mountain after Byrne took off from a height of 7,874 feet. Byrne, who hailed from Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, was featured in the BBC documentary "The Boy Who Can Fly" and was known as an experienced wingsuit flyer with hundreds of jumps to his name, making this incident a profound loss for the skydiving community. The sport involves wearing a specialized suit with webbing to allow for mid-air lift, highlighting the inherent risks involved in the pursuit of this extreme sport.</p>

          <p>China has urged the international community to work towards de-escalation in the Iran crisis, as the threat of a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz looms following attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran's parliament has backed closing the strait in response to the attacks, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a critical waterway for global oil transport, and any blockade could trigger a sharp spike in crude prices, particularly affecting Asian economies that heavily rely on the strait for oil imports.</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi has called for a diplomatic solution and de-escalation of the conflict in Iran during an emergency board meeting. Grossi emphasized the need for calm to allow IAEA inspectors access to Iran's nuclear sites to assess the damage caused by recent attacks. He noted that no one, including the IAEA, has fully assessed the underground damage at the Fordo site, which was built under a mountain and targeted in recent attacks. Grossi expects significant damage to centrifuges due to the explosive payload used and their sensitivity to vibration, highlighting the urgency of a diplomatic resolution to ensure nuclear safety and transparency.</p>

          <p>Shipping groups are increasingly avoiding the Strait of Hormuz due to heightened fears of conflict in the Middle East following recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The world's largest shipping association, Bimco, indicates a decline in vessels navigating the strait, with some shipowners pausing transits. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial oil chokepoint, and its disruption could significantly impact global energy prices and supply chains. While some companies continue to sail through, they acknowledge the unpredictable situation and have emergency plans in place, with insurance costs expected to spike due to the increased risk.</p>

          <p>The article explores the debate surrounding the safety of moderate alcohol consumption, noting that while heavy drinking is widely recognized as dangerous, the health effects of small amounts are still debated. Public health experts emphasize that moderate drinking is often misunderstood, with many people underestimating the amount of alcohol they consume. While some studies suggest potential cardiovascular benefits from very modest alcohol consumption, doctors generally advise against starting to drink for health reasons. The key takeaways are that heavy drinking is dangerous and it's easy to drink too much, but light drinking is generally not a significant health concern.</p>

The Fuzhou Intermediate Peopleâ€™s Court in Fujian province ordered the confiscation of Liuâ€™s personal property and the return of his illegal gains to the state. The court cited the large amount of bribes and the serious loss to the state and the people, but showed leniency due to Liu's admission of guilt, repentance, and active return of the money taken. Chinese law allows for commutation to life imprisonment if no further crimes are committed during the reprieve period, and a reduction to 25 years for significant contributions.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has proposed allowing non-domiciled residents to avoid UK taxes by paying a Â£250,000 fee, with the revenue directed to low-income individuals. Under the plan, non-doms would receive a "Britannia Card" exempting them from taxes on wealth, income, and capital gains earned abroad, as well as inheritance tax. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage believes this would attract talented individuals and entrepreneurs to the UK, generating additional revenue through stamp duty and VAT. Critics, including Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves, argue it would disproportionately benefit foreign billionaires and necessitate tax increases or cuts to public services.

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, though the final decision rests with the country's national security council. Experts suggest this move risks alienating neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. The Strait of Hormuz is a critical waterway for global oil transport, and its closure could lead to higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. While the U.S. has called on China to prevent the closure, analysts believe Iran risks significant self-inflicted harm by disrupting oil flows and antagonizing key economic partners.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis (TB) screening for foreign nationals planning to stay over three months, beginning with those from the Philippines and Nepal. The decision is driven by the increasing number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB while in Japan, primarily from these countries. Individuals must provide evidence of being TB-free before arrival or face denial of entry. This measure aims to prevent the spread of TB, which remains a global health concern despite being curable and preventable, and aligns with Japan's efforts to maintain its low TB incidence rate.</p>

The measures, which could cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, are intended to boost growth and stabilize the UK economy. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms.

The reliance on emergency powers is seen as a threat to civic society and political norms, with Trump governing in a permanent crisis mode and authoritarian style. Courts have pushed back on some of Trump's actions, but the trend raises concerns about the erosion of constitutional checks and balances.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals increasing racism against Sinti and Roma in Germany, with a significant rise in reported incidents. The report criticizes the media for perpetuating cliches and highlights the hostile atmosphere faced by the community. Despite challenges, there have been some successes, including a complaint upheld by the German Press Council. The German government is committed to protecting minorities, but the report indicates that much work remains to be done to combat discrimination and promote inclusion.</p>

          <p>Russia's response is being closely watched following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but Moscow may not be quick to offer its ally a hand. While Iran has supported Russia in the war in Ukraine, Moscow has limited capacity to reciprocate and must balance its relationship with Iran against its desire to improve ties with the US. So far, Russia's response has been muted, calling on Iran and Israel to negotiate a peaceful resolution, highlighting the complexities of Russia's position in the escalating conflict.</p>
