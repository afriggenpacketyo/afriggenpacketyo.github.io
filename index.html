        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government has successfully passed a vote on its welfare bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to quell a rebellion within the Labour party. Fearing a defeat, ministers agreed to delay changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) rules until a review is completed, a move that significantly weakens the bill's original cost-saving intentions. This chaotic process has been criticized by MPs from all parties as a shambles, undermining the authority of both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Despite the concessions, 44 Labour MPs still voted against the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and rising profits. In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field stated it was time for the company to go public to allow the community to share in its ownership and to enable "big swings," including future acquisitions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to arrest Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, if he obstructs Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. Speaking at a new migrant detention center, Trump also repeated unsubstantiated claims that Mamdani is a "communist" and suggested he might be in the country illegally, despite Mamdani being a naturalized U.S. citizen since 2018. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, responded by calling the president's remarks an act of intimidation against democracy and those who speak out. The exchange highlights escalating political tensions ahead of the city's mayoral election.</p>

The White House stated the information would be moved to NASA, but the reports were not found there.

          <p>An opinion article analyzes the escalating public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, framing it as a lesson in the treacherous nature of political alliances with powerful, bullying figures. The conflict, which now includes presidential threats to investigate Musk's citizenship for potential deportation, is linked to similar rhetoric aimed at NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The author argues this represents a chilling weaponization of denaturalization against political enemies, creating a dangerous precedent. This tactic could intimidate the country's 25 million naturalized citizens into silence, undermining core American principles regardless of one's opinion of the high-profile individuals involved.</p>

While its removal provided relief, industry associations caution that the overall legislation remains detrimental to renewable energy, as it still phases out crucial investment and production tax credits.

The legislation, which establishes work requirements and restricts state funding mechanisms, is projected to cause nearly 12 million people to lose insurance coverage. This, combined with the expiration of Obamacare subsidies, could leave 17 million uninsured, leading to more uncompensated care, higher costs for everyone, and thousands of preventable deaths. The article suggests this policy shift will create a significant political vulnerability for the GOP, as voters experience the negative consequences.</p>

          <p>The Senate has approved a sweeping tax and spending package that could significantly affect household finances across the United States. Key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, and boosting the child tax credit. The legislation also introduces new tax breaks for seniors, tip income, and overtime pay, while simultaneously proposing major spending cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The bill also includes new savings accounts for children and substantial changes to federal student loan programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican spending bill passed by the Senate contains sweeping changes to U.S. health care, with new estimates projecting it will cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid. These cuts are expected to leave nearly 12 million people uninsured by 2034, primarily by establishing strict new work requirements and limiting how states can fund their programs. Healthcare advocates warn that the loss of federal funding could be devastating for rural hospitals, which are heavily dependent on Medicaid. Despite a last-minute $25 billion fund added to help these hospitals, critics argue it is insufficient to prevent widespread closures and job losses.</p>

It also introduces unprecedented fees for asylum seekers and makes it easier for local law enforcement to partner with federal authorities on deportations.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that he would not rule out an interest rate cut at the central bank's upcoming meeting this month. The comments come amid a sustained public pressure campaign from President Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that the Fed slash rates. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell emphasized that any decision would depend on evolving economic data and that the Fed remains focused on its dual mandate of controlling inflation and maximizing employment. He affirmed that a majority of the Fed's board members still anticipate rate reductions before the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An inquest is examining the death of a five-year-old boy, Benedict Blythe, who died from a severe food-induced allergic reaction after collapsing at his primary school in December 2021. The boy, who had known allergies, vomited after eating a biscuit from home and later collapsed, despite a teaching assistant administering an adrenaline auto-injector. His mother described him as a "kind-souled" and "curious" child, stating that the world should have been safer for him. A consultant pediatrician testified that she strongly believed anaphylaxis, not asthma as initially reported, was the cause of death.</p>

          <p>The luxury athletic brand Lululemon is suing wholesale giant Costco, accusing it of patent infringement by selling knockoffs of its signature apparel. In a lawsuit, Lululemon claims that Costco's private-label Kirkland Signature brand has copied several of its proprietary designs to create lower-priced "dupes." The complaint argues that Costco is illegally trading on Lululemon's reputation and goodwill by selling these unauthorized products. Lululemon, a leader in the high-end athleisure market, stated it takes protecting its intellectual property very seriously and will pursue necessary legal action to enforce its rights.</p>

          <p>French player Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard made Wimbledon history by hitting a 153mph serve, the fastest ever recorded at the tournament, breaking the previous record by 5mph. Despite this incredible feat and hitting 37 aces, the 21-year-old ultimately lost a five-set epic to the fifth seed, Taylor Fritz. The high-quality match was a battle of powerful serves, with Fritz himself hitting 29 aces. Mpetshi Perricard's record-breaking serve was ironically returned, and he lost the point, but he later predicted that serves could get even faster in the future as players become stronger.</p>

          <p>Despite Mark Zuckerberg's multi-billion-dollar spending spree to attract top AI talent, Meta Platforms' stock has remained resilient. An analysis suggests investors are willing to overlook the high costs, which could exceed $1 billion in annual expenses for a new "superintelligence" unit, because of AI's potential for both cost savings and revenue growth. The push has included a major investment in Scale AI and hiring its CEO, along with poaching top researchers from competitors. While these investments have improved current products, the article argues that long-term stock performance will depend on monetizing new AI initiatives, like its Llama model.

          <p>Senate Republicans have narrowly passed a massive tax and spending bill, a top priority for President Donald Trump, after an overnight session of amendment votes. The legislation, which extends 2017 tax cuts and funds a hardline immigration agenda, required Vice President JD Vance to cast a tie-breaking vote. The bill also imposes significant cuts and new work requirements for social safety net programs like Medicaid. It now returns to the House, where its passage is uncertain due to a razor-thin Republican majority and deep divisions among moderate and conservative factions over its fiscal and social impacts.</p>
