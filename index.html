          <p>A lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey, resulted in one fatality and thirteen injuries. The deceased was a 61-year-old man, and the injured victims, ranging in age from 7 to 61, were transported to local hospitals for treatment. This incident occurred during a severe thunderstorm and marks at least the third time people have been struck by lightning in the Tri-State Area in the past month. Governor Phil Murphy acknowledged the tragic event and asked for prayers for those involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June, marking the second straight month of decline and raising fears of a potential recession. The drop was unexpected by economists and is exacerbated by ongoing trade tensions with the United States, which has imposed a 25% tariff on Japanese imports. Shipments to the U.S. plunged by 11.4%, with automobile exports hit particularly hard, falling 26.7% as carmakers appear to be absorbing tariff costs to maintain market share. The situation is politically sensitive ahead of Japan's upcoming Upper House elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 22:13:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data obtained by CBS News shows that of the approximately 100,000 people deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions. While 70,583 of the deportees were convicted criminals, a significant portion of their offenses were related to traffic or immigration violations. Assault convictions accounted for about 15.2% of the total, while sex offenses and kidnapping were each under 2%. These figures contrast with the administration's public focus on deporting the "worst of the worst" violent offenders.</p>

          <p>During Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, both nations have focused on securing trade and investment agreements, sidelining major political disputes. The deals reportedly involve expanded market access for Australian agricultural products, financial sector cooperation, and potential tariff reductions. Notably, the contentious issue regarding the Chinese-operated Darwin Port has not been a central topic of discussion, signaling a mutual effort to find common ground. This diplomatic approach aims to stabilize economic relations amid broader global trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are cautioning that any attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would likely cause significant market instability, including an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The legality of such a move is uncertain and would likely be challenged in court, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. While the president publicly downplayed the likelihood of firing Powell, his persistent criticism over interest rate policy has created ongoing uncertainty. Experts stress the importance of an independent central bank for economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. Seven & i had previously rejected offers, stating they undervalued the company, which operates the 7-Eleven franchise.

          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to help veterans who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments avoid foreclosure. The legislation comes after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ended a previous assistance program, leaving thousands of veterans with unaffordable options to catch up on their loans. The new law would allow veterans to move their missed payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current and preventing foreclosure. Lawmakers and mortgage industry groups have praised the fix as a crucial and proven method to help veterans stay in their homes.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued from a remote area of California's Stanislaus National Forest after she left a trail of handwritten notes for searchers to follow. The pair became lost after their vehicle's GPS led them onto remote roads where they lost signal. The Calaveras County search-and-rescue team found the notes, which pleaded for help and provided contact information, guiding them to the stranded vehicle. Authorities praised the mother for her resourcefulness and for having notified someone of her travel plans, which was crucial for initiating the search.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA, challenging the termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the congressionally funded program, which helps communities finance projects to mitigate the impact of natural disasters. The states claim the cuts jeopardize projects that have been in development for years and leave communities at a higher risk of harm. The administration had previously described the BRIC program as "wasteful."</p>

          <p>Key social programs that provide companionship and support to older adults are at risk due to potential federal funding cuts from a new domestic spending bill. Programs like the Senior Companion Program, which connects volunteers with elderly residents living alone, could lose significant funding, potentially forcing them to shut down. Experts warn that social isolation is a major health risk for seniors, increasing their chances of dementia, heart disease, and premature death. Program directors are concerned that cutting these services will lead to increased institutionalization and a decline in well-being.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called on the Trump administration to release all government files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, stating that "the time has come" for transparency. In a direct contradiction to President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a "hoax," Pence argued for getting the facts to the American people, while ensuring victims' names are protected. Pence's stance highlights a significant division within the Republican party on how to handle the controversial case. The Justice Department recently concluded its review, identifying over 1,000 victims but no evidence of a "client list."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's rationale for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid, citing "waste, fraud and abuse," is being questioned by former officials and aid experts. The administration claims a thorough review of USAID programs uncovered massive misuse of funds, but critics, including the agency's fired inspector general, say little proof has been provided. Sources allege the review was superficial, targeting programs with keywords like "gender" or "climate" for political reasons rather than assessing their effectiveness. This lack of transparency has raised concerns in Congress about the legitimacy of the cuts.</p>

A preliminary report from Indian authorities confirmed the switches were moved but did not state how.

Although the proposed 50% tariffs are on hold, the threat alone has caused U.S. buyers to cancel orders from Lesotho's garment factories, which are central to its economy. The industry, which produces clothing for major U.S. brands, is now facing factory closures and the potential loss of 40,000 jobs in a country of two million people.

Prices vary regionally, with some areas seeing increases of up to 13% since last year, driven by high demand and a lack of cheaper, council-run options. Families on Universal Credit face additional challenges, as they must pay these high costs upfront and wait for reimbursement. The rising expense places a significant financial burden on working parents, especially for older children or those with special needs.</p>

With insurance premiums soaring since the Grenfell Tower fire, these percentage-based commissions have also increased, allegedly allowing freeholders to profit from the disaster.
