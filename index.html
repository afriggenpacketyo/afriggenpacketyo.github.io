          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay $511 million to settle a criminal case for conspiring with American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts from 2010 to 2021, according to the Department of Justice. The company pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to aid in the preparation of false income tax returns. Credit Suisse also entered a non-prosecution agreement regarding U.S. accounts booked at its Singapore branch, which held over $2 billion in undeclared assets for U.S. persons between 2014 and June 2023. This settlement addresses Credit Suisse's new crimes and breach of its May 2014 plea agreement with the United States.</p>

          <p>During an interview, President Trump questioned his duty to uphold the Constitution and the Fifth Amendment, stating, "I don't know" when asked about due process rights for citizens and noncitizens. Legal experts, including constitutional law expert Michael Gerhardt, emphasized that the Fifth Amendment applies to all persons, not just citizens, and that every president swears an oath to defend the Constitution. Trump's comments have drawn criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer calling them "un-American."

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant flight delays and cancellations due to a combination of factors, including an equipment failure at an air traffic control center, staffing shortages, and runway construction. Air traffic controllers briefly lost communication with planes, leading to absences under a law allowing federal workers to leave work after a traumatic event. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation into the problems, blaming mismanagement at the FAA and cuts imposed by the Trump administration. United Airlines, the largest carrier at Newark, has cut 35 round-trip flights per day to mitigate the impact on customers.</p>

The SSA's inspector general found that a significant number of overpayments were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. While this change is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI.</p>

          <p>The president and two other top officers of the Los Angeles Fire Department's labor union have been suspended following an investigation that uncovered $800,000 in credit card purchases lacking proper documentation. The International Assn. of Fire Fighters (IAFF) appointed a conservator to take over the union, citing financial improprieties, including missing receipts. The audit revealed that President Freddy Escobar initiated nearly 2,000 transactions totaling over $311,000, with more than 70% of those transactions lacking supporting documentation. The investigation began after concerns were raised about improper record-keeping and use of union funds.</p>

Cramer emphasized that the market has largely recovered from the initial sell-off triggered by the tariff announcement, with optimism building on hopes of upcoming trade deals.

The details are unclear, but the tariffs would apply to American production companies producing films abroad.
