          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 04:55:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu and Shein are facing new challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a trade loophole and increased tariffs on Chinese imports, which had previously allowed them to maintain low prices. Experts suggest that these e-commerce giants are implementing contingency plans, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local fulfillment models, to mitigate the impact of these tariffs. While prices have already risen on Shein, both companies remain competitive, with some experts believing they can still offer products at lower prices than Amazon, even after absorbing tariff costs. The article emphasizes the agility and adaptability of these Chinese e-commerce apps in navigating adverse economic conditions, including a trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's Christian Democrats, fell short of the required votes in the Bundestag to become chancellor, despite his coalition holding a majority of seats. This unexpected outcome is seen as a significant setback and a humiliation, with political commentators suggesting dissent within the Social Democrat SPD, Merz's coalition partner, as a possible cause. The failure undermines Merz's hopes of presenting a strong and united front after the previous government's collapse. The article notes that this is an unprecedented event in modern German history, with no candidate failing in this way since 1949, and it remains to be seen whether Merz will pursue a second vote.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, a conservative Christian Democrat, is set to be sworn in as Germanyâ€™s next chancellor, following a coalition agreement between the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats.

          <p>A senior Hamas official stated that further talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are pointless, as Israel has approved an expanded offensive, potentially seizing all of Gaza indefinitely. Israeli officials indicated the offensive would involve capturing Gaza, displacing most of its population, and controlling aid, following a two-month blockade causing severe food shortages. The UN Secretary-General warned that expanded operations would lead to more civilian deaths and destruction, while other world leaders expressed deep concern. The Israeli military aims for the return of hostages and the decisive defeat of Hamas.</p>

The author argues that the move may be a tactic to provoke the media and disrupt the industry, rather than a genuine effort to support American cinema.

          <p>This article suggests that Visa and UnitedHealth Group are strong buys for investors in May, while Nvidia is a stock to avoid. Visa's consistent double-digit growth in cross-border payment volume and its avoidance of lending make it a compelling investment. UnitedHealth Group, despite recent challenges, possesses premium pricing power and a predictable operating model. Nvidia, on the other hand, faces headwinds such as export restrictions to China, increased competition, and the potential for a bubble-bursting event. (not investment advice)</p>

The dismissals, potentially related to corruption or ideological differences, undermine the competence and reliability of China's military leadership. This internal turmoil may weaken Xi's appetite for war, providing Taiwan and the United States with more time to strengthen their defenses.
