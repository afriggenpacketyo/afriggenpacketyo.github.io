          <h2>Southwest Airlines to Reduce Flight Capacity Amid Economic Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines announced it would be cutting flight capacity in the second half of the year due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker domestic bookings. The airline anticipates unit revenue to remain flat or decline by up to 4% in the second quarter. Despite the cautious outlook, Southwest's first-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed analysts' expectations, driven by positive results from recent company initiatives. The company is refraining from updating its full-year guidance due to the unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump stated that a deal to end the war was close but Zelenskyy's refusal prolongs the conflict, while Vice-President Vance proposed a deal to freeze territorial lines close to their current positions. Zelenskyy rejected this proposal as unconstitutional, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the US and Ukraine regarding the resolution of the conflict, which stems back to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p>

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and his administration, challenging the legality of new tariffs imposed on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that the tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy by increasing costs for consumers. The legal challenge follows a similar lawsuit filed by small businesses, reflecting growing opposition to the administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion for automakers to move vehicle production to the U.S. faces significant challenges, including existing tariffs on auto parts and the time required to relocate production lines. Relocating production lines takes years of planning and construction, along with hiring workers and building infrastructure. While increasing U.S. production is possible, it is a complex and costly process that requires significant time and investment.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market's Two-Day Rally Fueled by 'Short Squeeze'</h2>

          <p>The stock market's two-day rally has been attributed to a "short squeeze," where short sellers are forced to buy back borrowed stocks to limit losses. Hedge fund short sellers recently increased bearish wagers after market volatility. When the market rallied, short sellers were compelled to rapidly buy back their borrowed stocks. The phenomenon is credited with the market's unexpected surge.</p>
