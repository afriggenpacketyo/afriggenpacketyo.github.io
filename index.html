          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others, some critically. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power and was headed in the wrong direction before the crash, which caused significant damage to its masts and rigging. Emergency responders transported the injured to Pier 16, where a crowd gathered, cheering for the survivors and chanting "Mex-i-co!" The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, which briefly closed all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge. This article indicates that similar incidents involving ships striking the Brooklyn Bridge have occurred in the past, highlighting the need for careful navigation in the busy harbor.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes India's strategic challenges in the face of ongoing conflict with Pakistan, noting that recent military clashes have done little to resolve long-standing tensions. Despite India's aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power, it remains entangled in a complex and seemingly intractable conflict with its smaller neighbor. The article highlights the risk of escalation due to religious nationalism and the involvement of global powers, with the United States supporting India and China backing Pakistan. The analysis suggests that India must find a way to manage the problem of terrorism emanating from Pakistan while also addressing its broader strategic goals. </p>

          <p>This article reflects on the life and legacy of Malcolm X, highlighting his advocacy for Black self-confidence and resistance against oppression. Born in 1925, Malcolm X's childhood was marked by racism and violence, leading him to question the possibility of achieving the "American Dream" for Black people. He joined the Nation of Islam, denouncing "white devils" and advocating for self-defense "by any means necessary." Later in life, Malcolm X distanced himself from the Nation of Islam, embracing a broader vision of unity among oppressed people and collaborating with the civil rights movement. The article emphasizes the enduring relevance of Malcolm X's message in the face of ongoing racial injustice.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that a simple change in how bricks are stacked in traditional kilns in Bangladesh could significantly reduce air pollution. The study found that stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring more consistent coal delivery can reduce fuel use by 23% and lower emissions of carbon dioxide and particulate matter by about 20%. This NPR article emphasizes the potential for low-cost interventions to improve both environmental conditions and worker health, as well as increase profits for kiln owners.

From Ari Aster's satirical western "Eddington" to Dominik Moll's detective movie "Dossier 137," the films explore disillusionment and the failure of individuals to overcome systemic issues. The reviewer praises Harris Dickinson's directorial debut, "Urchin," for its energetic portrayal of a drug-addled boy-man, but ultimately concludes that many of the films offer a pessimistic view of human nature and society.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed pausing the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults, citing budget deficits. The proposal also includes charging current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. Newsom attributed the budget issues to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and increased healthcare costs. Republicans have attributed the increases to the 2024 policy allowing undocumented individuals to be eligible for Medi-Cal.</p>
