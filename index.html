          <p>President Donald Trump met with House Speaker Mike Johnson and members of the House Freedom Caucus to address sticking points in the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act." Negotiations have stalled due to disagreements over Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Despite the White House's optimism, hard-liners remain critical of the bill, citing concerns about the national deficit. Trump threatened to primary those who vote against it, while the White House Office of Management and Budget called failure to pass the bill a "betrayal," as the bill's passage remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down regulations requiring employers to provide workers with time off and accommodations for abortions. The ruling, made by Judge David Joseph, favored conservative lawmakers and religious groups who opposed the EEOC's inclusion of abortion in regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. Joseph argued that Congress did not explicitly include abortion in the law. The ruling comes amid broader changes at the EEOC under the Trump administration, which are expected to lead to a rewriting of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.</p>

Despite promises to end the use of asylum hotels, the number of hotels used to house asylum seekers has increased since Labour took office.

Returns of individuals with no legal right to remain in the UK have increased, but forced removals remain a smaller proportion.</p>

          <p>Chris Brown has confirmed that his Breezy Bowl tour will proceed as planned after being released on bail in the U.K., where he was arrested for allegedly attacking a music producer in 2023. The judge ordered Brown to pay $6.7 million bail to guarantee his court appearance, allowing him to embark on the tour. The arrest stems from a civil lawsuit filed by music producer Amadou Diaw, who alleges that Brown assaulted him with a tequila bottle at a London nightclub. Brown and a co-defendant are ordered to return to court on June 20.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill faces significant hurdles in Congress due to disagreements among Republicans. The primary sticking points include the amount of spending cuts, proposed changes to Medicaid, and state and local tax deductions. The bill's potential to add trillions to the national debt has fueled opposition from the House Freedom Caucus. Negotiations are ongoing to address these concerns, but the bill's future remains uncertain as Republicans struggle to find common ground.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the deportation of eight men to South Sudan "unquestionably" violated a court order requiring migrants to be allowed to challenge their removal to third countries. The Department of Homeland Security argued that the deportees were "uniquely barbaric monsters" convicted of heinous crimes, but the judge maintained that they were still entitled to due process. The deportations occurred despite conflicting notices and language barriers, raising concerns about the government's disregard for judicial orders and due process rights.</p>

          <p>The future of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" hinges on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, creating a division among Republicans. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes, benefiting residents of high-tax states. Trump's 2017 tax bill capped the deduction at $10,000, sparking protests from Republicans in affected states. While Trump has since reversed his stance, the debate over raising the cap is threatening to derail the current tax bill, with hardliners opposing any deal that would increase the national debt.</p>
