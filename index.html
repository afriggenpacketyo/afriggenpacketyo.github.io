          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a longtime confidant, as his deputy, signaling a potential successor amid succession fears. The move comes as the war in Gaza and Israeli military operations in the West Bank underscore the Palestinian Authority's challenges. Some analysts view the appointment as Abbas's preference for his heir, while others see it as a cosmetic change to appease Arab officials. The focus on leadership politics during ongoing conflict has drawn criticism from Palestinians, who feel the PA is out of touch with their struggles.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by volatile trade policies, including tariff increases on Chinese goods and unprecedented levies on both rivals and allies. After initially escalating tariffs, Trump paused some increases for 90 days, calling for bilateral negotiations to reduce the US trade deficit. However, ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have unsettled investors and undermined confidence in the US's management of the global economy. The outcome of these trade negotiations will likely shape perceptions of Trump's first 100 days and offer insights into his future policies.</p>

          <p>A California legislator is urging the State Bar of California to reinstate the traditional national exam format after a problematic February bar exam. Technical glitches and irregularities plagued the new exam, leading to calls for a return to the National Conference of Bar Examiners system. The State Bar's decision to develop its own questions, intended as a cost-cutting measure, has faced criticism, especially after it was revealed that AI was used to draft some questions. Legal experts argue that the State Bar's leadership must address the issues and ensure a fair testing process.</p>

          <p>The 'Gran Abuelo,' an approximately 5,400-year-old tree in Chile, is threatened by a proposed highway project. The tree, located in Alerce Costero National Park, is a valuable record-keeper of climate patterns. Scientists warn that the road will increase the risk of wildfires and disrupt the ecosystem. The scientific community and local residents are pushing back against the project to protect the ancient tree and its surrounding environment.</p>
