          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car. The first fire occurred at a house converted into flats in Islington, while the second targeted Starmer's private home in Kentish Town. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to Starmer's high-profile status, treating the incidents as suspicious. The article details witness accounts and the extent of the damage, noting that Starmer still owns the Kentish Town property but resides at Downing Street. Relevant context includes the increased security concerns around political figures and their properties.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is set to reduce its workforce by 3%, impacting employees across all levels, teams, and geographies. The decision is part of organizational changes aimed at positioning the company for success in a dynamic marketplace, according to a Microsoft spokesperson. This round of layoffs is not performance-based and is likely the largest since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. The article contextualizes the layoffs with Microsoft's recent better-than-expected financial results and upbeat quarterly forecast, signaling a strategic realignment rather than a response to financial distress.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down for personal reasons, leading the company to suspend its 2025 forecast. Stephen Hemsley, who previously served as CEO from 2006 to 2017, will succeed Witty. The company's decision to pull its guidance is partly attributed to higher medical costs, particularly for new enrollees in private Medicare plans. The article notes that Witty's tenure included navigating government investigations, a cyberattack, and public scrutiny following the murder of a UnitedHealthcare executive. This leadership change introduces uncertainty about the company's strategic direction and financial performance.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, marking the smallest annual increase since February 2021, driven by lower prices for groceries and gasoline. However, economists warn that President Trump's tariffs could soon reignite inflation, potentially costing the average U.S. household an extra $2,800. The article details how tariffs, as taxes on imports, are expected to be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Despite a temporary trade deal with China, core inflation is still projected to rise, creating uncertainty about the inflation outlook.</p>

          <p>A tariff truce between the U.S. and China will provide temporary relief for companies but prolongs economic uncertainty. Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%. Experts warn that a long-term trade deal is challenging, and the reduced tariff rate could still lead to consumer price hikes. The article discusses the potential impacts on consumer confidence, economic growth, and shipping logistics.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S.-U.K. trade deal, touted as "historic," reveals the limitations of President Trump's trade strategy. The agreement includes clear commitments to roll back tariffs on only three product categories, leaving significant bilateral irritants unresolved. The article contrasts the deal with the abandoned Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have eliminated more tariffs and reduced non-tariff barriers. The author argues that Trump's tariffs have undermined U.S. exporters' competitiveness and pushed other countries to sign agreements that exclude the U.S.</p>
