        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed significant signs of strain in July as key indicators failed to meet forecasts, signaling a loss of momentum after a stronger first half of the year. Retail sales growth slowed considerably, and industrial output registered its weakest performance since last November, reflecting persistent weak domestic demand and the impact of government curbs on excess industrial capacity. The disappointing data was also attributed to extreme weather conditions that disrupted operations, while the urban unemployment rate edged slightly higher. Economists warn that risks to achieving the full-year growth target remain, increasing calls for new policy support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has eliminated directives in Washington, D.C., that limited cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, effectively ending the city's 'sanctuary' policies. The move mandates that the Metropolitan Police Department can fully assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including sharing information from traffic stops and honoring administrative warrants. This sweeping reversal is part of a broader anti-crime crackdown initiated by President Trump, who has invoked emergency powers to assert temporary federal control over the city's police force. D.C.'s attorney general has challenged the legality of Bondi's order, creating a standoff over local governance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The summit is being held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a strategic military installation chosen for its security capabilities and historical resonance, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The hastily arranged meeting follows unsuccessful peace talks and aims to find a path toward a ceasefire, though White House officials have tempered expectations, describing it as a 'listening exercise.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend but will be briefed afterward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent article highlights a significant decline in close friendships among young men since 1990, contributing to a widespread issue of loneliness and isolation. Research indicates that a majority of young men feel that nobody truly knows them, and many harbor misogynistic beliefs associated with being in the 'man box.' The author argues that this is a societal problem, as men's failure to maintain connections harms everyone and can lead women to bear the emotional burden in relationships. The piece calls for men to reject identities based on domination and actively cultivate deeper, offline communities to combat this growing crisis.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the high-stakes meeting in Alaska, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that President Trump's primary goal is to quickly assess whether a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine war is possible. Describing the summit as an initial step, Rubio emphasized that achieving a lasting peace would require further conversations on complex issues like security guarantees and territorial disputes. He stressed that an immediate ceasefire is a critical first objective to enable these deeper diplomatic discussions to occur. The Secretary reiterated that while the U.S. will facilitate the process, any final agreement must ultimately be accepted by both Ukraine and Russia.</p>

The FDNY and FBI hazmat teams responded quickly to the scene at 26 Federal Plaza, and authorities reported that the situation was brought under control without incident. At least two people were exposed to the substance, which is now being tested, and officials have stated there is no remaining threat to the public. The building has recently been a site of controversy and protests regarding the holding of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed off the coast of Africa, is rapidly intensifying and expected to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season by Friday. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen into a formidable major hurricane, with winds of at least 111 mph, as it approaches the Caribbean islands this weekend. While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S. mainland, its long-term path remains uncertain. Tropical storm watches have been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, which are expected to be the first to feel the storm's impact as it moves west-northwest.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending a more aggressive and earlier approach to treatment. Under the new advice, individuals with systolic pressure in the 130-139 range should start medication if lifestyle changes are ineffective after three to six months. A significant update is the recommendation to forgo alcohol entirely, a shift from previous advice that permitted moderate consumption, citing mounting evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. The guidelines also place a greater emphasis on lowering blood pressure to reduce the risk of dementia.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow him to appoint peers to the House of Lords, citing a 'democratic disparity' in the upper chamber. In a letter, Farage argued that his party's significant vote share in the last general election and subsequent local victories warrant representation, pointing out that parties with fewer votes and MPs currently have members in the Lords. He noted that while he supports reforming the chamber, the current imbalance is no longer tenable given the recent shifts in British politics. The decision to grant peerages to opposition parties rests with the prime minister.</p>

          <p>In a major escalation of federal control over Washington, D.C., the Trump administration has appointed DEA chief Terry Cole as the city's 'emergency police commissioner,' vesting him with the full powers of the police chief. The directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi requires the Metropolitan Police Department to seek approval from Cole before issuing any orders, effectively sidelining the city's current chief. This move is a key part of President Trump's temporary law-enforcement takeover of the capital, which he initiated by citing a public safety emergency.

          <p>According to a political analysis, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to enter his summit with Donald Trump as a master negotiator, prepared to exploit his opponent's perceived lack of detailed knowledge. The strategy will likely involve playing on Trump's desire for a quick, high-profile resolution to the Ukraine war, aiming to secure a deal favorable to Russia's interests. Putin is anticipated to offer superficial concessions, such as a loose promise of a future meeting with President Zelenskyy, to allow Trump to claim a victory.

          <p>The series finale of 'And Just Like That' is being analyzed as a fitting, if unconventional, conclusion for its protagonist, Carrie Bradshaw, who ends the series single. This article argues that this ending is truer to the core theme of the original 'Sex and the City,' which consistently valued female friendship as the central and most enduring 'soulmate' relationship. While the original series finale saw all four main characters in committed romantic relationships, the revival's conclusion for Carrie acknowledges that a fulfilled life does not necessarily require a male partner. This ending is seen as a brave and realistic evolution for the iconic character.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Instagram users are expressing frustration and confusion after their accounts were suspended by parent company Meta, often due to false accusations of violating child sexual exploitation policies. Many users have lost access to cherished photos and seen their businesses disrupted with little to no explanation or effective recourse. Despite acknowledging a similar problem with Facebook Groups, Meta has denied a wider issue, frequently only reinstating accounts after media outlets intervene on behalf of affected users. The problem is attributed by many to flawed AI moderation systems that leave users with no human to appeal to.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals High-Speed VTOL Drone Capable of Launching from Warships</h2>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a technological breakthrough that could significantly enhance its naval power. The runway-independent aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of various warships, such as destroyers and frigates, and then transition into fast, long-range cruise flight. This innovation could effectively transform much of the Chinese naval fleet into platforms for aerial operations, functioning as mini aircraft carriers. The project's team claims the drone's speed is far superior to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in operation, giving China a new strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>President Trump shrugged off concerns that Latin American countries are increasingly looking to China for economic partnerships in response to U.S. tariffs. When asked about the trend, Trump asserted that the U.S. economy is outperforming every other country in the world, including China, and suggested that the Latin American nations in question are not performing well economically. His remarks came as Brazil is reportedly coordinating with Beijing on a multilateral response to tariffs the U.S. imposed on a wide range of Brazilian exports, threatening a significant volume of trade between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have announced their intention to seek the death penalty against Teresa Youngblut, the 21-year-old woman charged with the murder of U.S. Border Patrol agent David Maland in Vermont. The agent was fatally shot during a traffic stop in January, which escalated into a shootout that also resulted in the death of Youngblut's companion. A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Youngblut with murder and the assault of two other agents. The shooting has been linked by authorities to a radical cultlike group known as the Zizians.</p>

          <p>As students in Los Angeles return to school, immigrant families are grappling with a pervasive climate of fear due to a recent increase in federal immigration enforcement activities across the city. High-profile raids, including some near school grounds, have left many undocumented parents afraid to send their children to class, forcing them to make contingency plans in case of detention and deportation. In response, the Los Angeles Unified School District is implementing 'safe zones' around 100 schools in predominantly Latino areas, where volunteers and officers will monitor for federal immigration activity to help ensure the safety and well-being of students and their families.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state in the U.S. to move to for 2025, a drop from its previous ranking as the seventh worst. The state received poor marks across several key categories, including affordability, where it ranked as the third worst, as well as safety, economic strength, education, and healthcare access. The report also highlighted Oregon's significant vulnerability to environmental hazards such as droughts and wildfires. According to the analysis, these combined challenges make the state less attractive for retaining current residents and attracting new ones compared to top-ranked states like Utah and New Hampshire.</p>

          <p>Violence has escalated in Serbia as police deployed tear gas and arrested dozens of anti-government protesters in Belgrade and Novi Sad. The demonstrations, which have been ongoing since late 2024, were initially sparked by a deadly building collapse widely blamed on corruption but have since grown into a broader movement demanding President Aleksandar Vucic call an early election. In Novi Sad, protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling party, smashing windows. The government has accused the demonstrators of inciting violence, while EU officials and UN experts have expressed deep concern over the pattern of repression against peaceful assembly.</p>

          <p>Martin Eberhard, one of the original co-founders of Tesla, has sharply criticized the company's Cybertruck, stating in a recent interview that it 'looks like a dumpster.' Eberhard, who served as Tesla's first CEO, also expressed his disappointment that the company reportedly canceled its plans for a low-cost, mass-market electric vehicle, often referred to as the Model 2. He argued that an affordable EV is what the world truly needs, rather than the polarizing and expensive Cybertruck. His comments come as recent sales figures for the Cybertruck have fallen short of the immense hype that preceded its launch.</p>
