          <p>Former President Donald Trump amplified a conspiracy theory claiming that President Biden is a robotic clone, reposting a user's false claim that Biden was "executed" in 2020 and replaced by a robotic double. This action continues a pattern of Trump promoting unsubstantiated and outlandish claims, further contributing to the spread of misinformation. The article highlights the ongoing trend of political figures leveraging social media to disseminate conspiracy theories, raising concerns about the erosion of trust in institutions and the potential for real-world harm stemming from these baseless assertions. The event underscores the challenges in combating the spread of misinformation in the digital age, especially when amplified by prominent figures. Optimism is low given the amplification of misinformation.</p>

Despite MLS teams receiving significant payments for participation, the league has allegedly refused to allocate a fair percentage of these funds to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement caps player earnings at 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, leading to a 90/10 split of prize money in favor of the league.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions, including suggesting he would no longer be "Mr. NICE GUY" to China and raising tariffs on steel imports, have injected uncertainty into the markets. These escalations follow a period of d√©tente in May, during which Trump reached a trade deal with the U.K. and delayed tariffs on the European Union. While the market had initially responded positively to these developments, the new tensions could quickly shift investor sentiment. The article suggests that the market's mood is highly dependent on communications from the White House, creating a volatile environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Students are facing the risk of subject "cold spots" due to universities cutting courses, prompting a government review of higher education funding in England. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is supporting collaboration among universities to address financial challenges in the sector. A Universities UK report suggests greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient. However, universities are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws designed to promote competition, potentially limiting course availability for students in their local areas.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures preventing children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs. More than 164,000 homeless children are living in temporary accommodation across England, leading to displacement and disruptions in their education. Families are being moved far from their support networks, exacerbating mental health issues and affecting children's school attendance. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation, enabling better access to education and healthcare.</p>

Despite a strong first quarter with a new starting lineup, the Sparks became visibly frustrated in the second half, leading to a physical and chippy game. Odyssey Sims led the Sparks with 32 points, but her efforts were insufficient to secure a win, leaving the team with a 2-6 record as they face a challenging road schedule.</p>

The law aims to increase black ownership of land, addressing historical imbalances from the apartheid era. Legal experts clarify that expropriation without compensation would occur in rare circumstances, such as unused land held for speculative purposes. The government intends to provide "just-and-equitable" compensation, potentially less than market value, while ensuring procedural fairness for landowners.</p>
