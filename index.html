          <p>Costco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong growth in membership income and e-commerce sales. The warehouse retailer has successfully attracted more members, particularly younger shoppers, by offering value and expanding its digital features. Despite facing inflation and higher tariff costs, the company has adapted by adjusting its merchandise and introducing private-label alternatives. Company executives noted that while same-store sales growth has decelerated slightly, overall traffic and transaction sizes have continued to climb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The parents of an 8-year-old girl still missing after a catastrophic flood at Camp Mystic in Texas have condemned the camp's decision to reopen a sister site in 2026. The flood on July 4th tragically killed 27 campers and counselors, with some cabins reportedly located in known flood zones. In a letter, the parents called the announcement "unthinkable" while their daughter remains missing and recovery efforts continue in the Guadalupe River. Other families of victims have echoed these sentiments, expressing that their safety concerns and grief have not been addressed by the camp's leadership.</p>

          <p>An armed group of nearly two dozen suspects conducted a brazen smash-and-grab robbery at a jewelry store in San Ramon, California, escaping with an estimated $1 million in merchandise. Surveillance footage captured the masked individuals using hammers and pickaxes to destroy display cases while at least one suspect pointed a firearm at employees. The incident is part of a continuing trend of organized retail theft in the state, prompting law enforcement to establish a dedicated task force. Several suspects were later detained after a police pursuit involving helicopters tracked their getaway vehicles.</p>

Raynae Madison and her family were visiting for her nephew's birthday when she found the unusual stone while sifting through soil in the park's designated search area. Park staff confirmed the gem's identity, explaining that brown diamonds from the crater get their color from structural defects formed during their creation. Madison named the stone the 'William Diamond' in honor of her nephew, continuing the park's long history of public diamond discoveries.</p>

          <p>The suicide prevention charity Samaritans is facing significant internal opposition to a proposal that would close more than half of its branches in the UK and Ireland. Hundreds of volunteers have threatened to leave if the plan, which favors a model of larger hubs and remote work, is approved. Critics argue the closures will sever vital community ties and question the feasibility of supporting volunteers remotely during emotionally intense calls. The charity's leadership insists the changes are necessary to answer more calls and make volunteering more accessible, but opponents fear it could cripple the organization.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that Travis Decker, the man accused of killing his three young daughters, is dead after human remains found in a remote area of Washington were identified through DNA testing. The discovery brings an end to a monthslong manhunt for the 32-year-old former Army soldier. Decker was the sole suspect in the deaths of his daughters, aged 5, 8, and 9, whose bodies were found at a campsite in May after he failed to return them to their mother. Prosecutors are now moving to drop the charges against him following the confirmation of his death.</p>

          <p>After facing intense takeover speculation earlier in the year, British energy major BP has seen its fortunes improve, with its share price climbing over 32% since early April. This resurgence has quieted rumors of potential acquisition by rivals like Shell or state-owned firms. The positive shift is attributed to a strategic reset, strong quarterly results that beat expectations, and a series of successful oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized the company's focus on internal growth and value creation for shareholders, signaling confidence in BP's standalone strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, a new letter signed by over 1,200 industry figures like Liev Schreiber rejects the boycott, calling it discriminatory, antisemitic, and based on misinformation. This counter-letter urges support for Israeli artists and calls for the release of hostages held by Hamas.</p>

According to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, Tesla's EV registrations in Europe dropped by approximately 23% year-over-year in August, contributing to a nearly 33% decline for the first eight months of the year. This downturn contrasts with a 26% rise in total EV registrations across the region.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to approve a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new structure, avoiding a potential ban. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, and a board controlled by Americans. Under the deal, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, will own less than 20% of the new entity, and the app's algorithm will be retrained to run on U.S. user data hosted by Oracle. The move satisfies a law requiring divestiture due to national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership.</p>

This loss adds to a period of poor form and has intensified fan frustration with the team's direction, recruitment, and on-field results.

While economists rely on formal data like unemployment and industrial production, some consumer behaviors have been validated as useful signals of economic anxiety. For instance, a decline in cardboard box shipments can reflect a slowdown in goods being transported and sold. The article suggests that the recent surge in public discussion about these indicators may itself be a sign of widespread economic uncertainty and unease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has drawn a parallel between the economic proposals of Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss, which he labeled a "disaster." The comments came after Burnham, who is seen as a potential leadership challenger, suggested a higher top rate of income tax. Starmer emphasized his government's commitment to fiscal stability, arguing that abandoning fiscal rules for either tax cuts or increased spending would harm working people. The exchange highlights potential friction within the Labour Party as it prepares for its autumn conference.</p>

          <p>In a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, anonymous shale oil executives asserted that President Donald Trump's policies are negatively impacting investment in the U.S. oil sector. The executives cited uncertainty from the administration's push for lower crude prices and higher tariffs as key factors causing them to delay investment decisions. Some respondents described the U.S. shale business as "broken," caught between the previous administration's hostility and the current one's perceived "economic ignorance." They warned that political volatility and "stroke of pen" risks are driving capital away from the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has given preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement offered by AI company Anthropic to resolve a class-action lawsuit filed by authors. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally used pirated book databases to train its AI models, including its well-known assistant, Claude. If finalized, this would be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history. As part of the agreement, Anthropic will pay approximately $3,000 per book and has agreed to destroy the datasets containing the allegedly pirated material, setting a significant precedent for AI and copyright law.</p>

          <p>NATO leaders are expressing increased concern that a direct, albeit limited, conflict with Russia may be unavoidable following a series of Russian incursions into NATO airspace. Recent incidents include Russian drones entering Polish territory and fighter jets violating Estonia's airspace, prompting airport closures in Denmark and Norway. In response, officials from Poland and the UK have issued stern warnings, threatening to shoot down any future unauthorized aircraft. President Trump has also stated that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their territory, marking a significant escalation in rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has directed federal agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if a government shutdown occurs next week. This aggressive stance escalates a partisan conflict over a government funding bill, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of using intimidation tactics. Unlike previous shutdowns where non-essential workers were furloughed, this directive suggests permanent position eliminations for programs not aligned with the president's priorities. Democratic leaders have condemned the move, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries calling it a threat and vowing not to be intimidated.</p>

The idea revives a debate from a previous Labour government's attempt to introduce ID cards, which was blocked by a subsequent coalition.

The author contends that the country's economy is supported by a strong foundation built on synergistic investments in green infrastructure, digital connectivity, and world-class scientific research. China now leads in the majority of key technologies and produces a significant share of the world's highly cited scientific papers. This synergy is fostering a more diversified and sustainable economic model, moving beyond reliance on a single source of growth.</p>

The report confirms that residents in the hard-hit west Altadena neighborhood did not receive evacuation warnings for hours, during which time the fire spread and caused 31 deaths. Key failures included outdated policies creating unclear authority for issuing evacuation orders, inadequate staffing in the Office of Emergency Management, and communication issues. The report outlines several reforms now underway to improve dispatch systems and evacuation protocols.</p>

President Trump seeks to remove Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud she denies, but lower courts have so far blocked the move. The case represents an unprecedented test of a president's authority to remove a Fed governor, a power limited by law to protect the central bank from political interference.</p>
