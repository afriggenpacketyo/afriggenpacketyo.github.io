          <p>Vox correspondents Anna North and Adam Clark Estes discuss the implications of AI for children's education and development. They express both hopes and fears, highlighting AI's potential in fields like medicine and language decoding, while also worrying about its impact on essential skills like writing and math. They also ponder how AI will change school assignments and grading, suggesting a shift towards oral presentations or audio-visual production skills. The article emphasizes the importance of parents engaging with AI alongside their children to guide them in its responsible use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House passed a Republican tax bill that includes an increase to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000, phasing out over $500,000. This provision, part of President Trump's tax package, aims to provide relief to lawmakers in high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey, and California, where the current SALT deduction is capped at $10,000. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially offsetting some benefits of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could face pushback in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amidst Canada's efforts to stabilize under new Prime Minister Mark Carney, Alberta is considering a referendum on secession. Fueling the movement is a sense of unfair limitation on Alberta's oil and gas resources and amplified by calls from Trump to annex Canada, coupled with the re-election of a Liberal federal government. Premier Danielle Smith asserts she doesn't personally support secession but seeks to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with Ottawa to unshackle the province's oil industry from climate change regulations. While the likelihood of secession remains slim due to constitutional hurdles, the movement underscores deep-seated grievances.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed spending bill is causing market turmoil, with Moody's downgrading U.S. debt due to concerns over rising deficits and interest costs. The bill, intended to stimulate growth, is instead adding to the $36.2 trillion debt load and pushing the deficit towards 7% of GDP. Investors are demanding higher yields on Treasury bonds as compensation for increased risk, and trade tensions with Japan and China exacerbate the situation. The market is increasing the risk premium for long-term bonds, leading to a severe rise in Treasury yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, falling to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. The Home Office also reported a decrease in the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels, though the figure remains higher than when Labour came to power last year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there had been a "300,000 drop in net migration since the election" last year.</p>

          <p>Brazilian counterintelligence officers are investigating the possibility that K.G.B. operatives may have filed birth certificates in the names of fictitious newborns during the last years of the Soviet Union. The investigation began when federal police agents unraveled a Kremlin spying operation in Brazil and confronted the mystery of how deep-cover Russian spies managed to obtain seemingly authentic Brazilian birth certificates. Investigators suspect that the operatives hoped that a future generation of spies would someday claim them and continue the fight against the West.</p>

          <p>Japan's National Police Agency will review rules for converting foreign driver's licenses to Japanese ones following a series of accidents involving foreign drivers. The agency plans to require residence certificates and may increase the number of questions on the knowledge test. The move comes after recent incidents, including a hit-and-run involving Chinese men and a wrong-way collision caused by a Peruvian man, both of whom had converted their licenses. Lawmakers have criticized the current system as "too easy."</p>
