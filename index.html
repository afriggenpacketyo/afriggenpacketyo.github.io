          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted alongside his brother for the 1989 murders of their parents, has been denied parole by a California board. During the hearing, Menendez expressed remorse for the killings, which he and his brother have long claimed were in self-defense against abuse. The decision can be revisited in three years, but the focus may now shift to a pending clemency request before Governor Gavin Newsom, who faces political risks in weighing in on the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has indefinitely stopped new construction at a Florida immigration detention facility, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," due to environmental concerns. The ruling, a setback for the state's support of the Trump administration's immigration policies, bars the transfer of new detainees and further development at the site, which environmental groups argued endangers the ecologically sensitive Everglades. While existing operations can continue, the order mandates the removal of temporary fencing and generators, upholding environmental protection laws.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% the previous month, though it still surpassed economists' expectations. The cooling was partly attributed to easing rice prices, which had previously surged and dominated headlines earlier in the year. Despite this moderation, the "core-core" inflation metric, closely watched by the Bank of Japan, held steady, indicating persistent underlying price pressures in the economy.

          <p>In an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales, Jeep's parent company Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee. The new model, which will be the brand's first hybrid in North America, aims to reclaim market share in the competitive midsize SUV segment with a new powertrain offering over 500 miles per tank. The reintroduction of the Cherokee, a model previously discontinued as a cost-cutting measure, is a key part of the new CEO's strategy to reinvigorate the iconic American brand.</p>

          <p>A global race to develop hypersonic weapons is intensifying, with China and Russia currently leading in the field while the U.S. and its allies play catch-up. These missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, pose a significant strategic threat because they are difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. While the West is now investing heavily in this technology, its previous focus on counter-terrorism allowed adversaries to gain a substantial lead in this new era of great power competition.</p>

The tribe and its allies, including environmental and religious liberty groups, are fighting the mine's development, viewing the court's reprieve as a vital, if temporary, victory.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests President Trump's policy on Ukraine has been confusing and ultimately weakened following a meeting with European leaders. While Trump seemed to commit to U.S. "security guarantees" for Ukraine, a significant shift from his previous isolationist rhetoric, Russia has predictably and repeatedly rejected any plan involving foreign troops. This public undermining of the U.S. president's new position, combined with doubts about the feasibility of a bilateral summit, makes the administration's diplomatic efforts appear ineffective and contradictory.</p>
