          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 in NLCS Game 1, largely due to Blake Snell's exceptional eight-inning scoreless performance, where he faced the minimum 24 batters. Despite a chaotic fourth-inning double-play by the Brewers that thwarted a bases-loaded opportunity for the Dodgers, Freddie Freeman's sixth-inning home run secured the lead. Snell's master class on the mound, including 10 strikeouts, ensured the Dodgers overcame early adversity and took a 1-0 series advantage.</p>

          <p>SAG-AFTRA praised California Governor Gavin Newsom for signing new legislation, SB 683, aimed at protecting performers' likeness from misuse by artificial intelligence. The law provides a meaningful remedy, allowing courts to order the takedown of unauthorized AI replicas, particularly for commercial purposes. This move addresses growing concerns in Hollywood, where celebrities have reported their images and voices being used without consent, reinforcing California's stance against AI abuse.</p>

          <p>European politicians perceive the current global landscape as increasingly chaotic and unstable, likening it to a "three-body problem" from science fiction. This instability is attributed to the United States' perceived undermining of the global order, China's weaponization of critical minerals impacting European industry, and Russia's ongoing war at the EU's borders. The situation suggests a search for new trajectories as existing solutions prove elusive.</p>

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free driving law to combat distracted driving, which claims an average of nine lives daily nationwide. The state is also utilizing telematics data from smartphones and vehicles to identify "hot spots" where distracted driving is prevalent, such as rural areas. This data-driven approach aims to enhance educational programs and law enforcement visibility, ultimately improving road safety and preventing tragedies like the 2019 death of Randall Siddens.</p>
