          <p>Rosa Chang, a Korean-born artist, is teaching Maryland Institute College of Art students the centuries-old tradition of indigo and natural dyes. Her class, "Mindful Colors: Natural Dyes from Korea and Beyond," explores the relationship between color and nature, using plants like indigo and marigold to create various hues. Chang, who grew tired of the toxic fabrics in the fashion industry, emphasizes indigo's cultural significance, rich history, and medicinal benefits, including its use by samurais to protect wounds. The students are working on final projects to preserve the tradition and capture the hues and historical processes they have learned in the class.</p>

          <p>A Gloucester Township, New Jersey, couple, Branndon Mosley and Brenda Spencer, have been arrested for allegedly abusing and confining a child in their home for several years. The victim, now 18, escaped with a neighbor's help and reported the abuse, which began around 2018 when Spencer removed them from school. The victim was allegedly forced to live in a dog crate for a year and later chained in a bathroom, with Mosley accused of sexual assault and beatings. Authorities also removed another 13-year-old child from the home, highlighting concerns about homeschooling regulations in New Jersey.</p>

She recounted specific instances of violence, including being hit in the head and thrown onto a bed, resulting in injuries and scars. Ventura also testified that Combs raped her after she tried to end their relationship and that she later received a $20 million settlement after suing him for the abuse in 2023.</p>

The FAA stated they were unaware of the issue until after the accident and are now insisting on its repair before resuming operations from the Pentagon.

The UN accuses Israel of using food and fuel as leverage in a military strategy, arguing the aid would be channeled through militarized hubs, cutting off vulnerable areas. The new system, run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces, aims to supply aid to a portion of Gaza's population, with construction ongoing at multiple sites. The sites are similar in size to existing distribution sites and are located near IDF Forward Operating Bases.</p>

Instead, the birds showed injuries consistent with trauma, suggesting the possibility of foul play involving a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. The investigation into the bird deaths is ongoing.</p>

          <p>President Trump, during a visit to Saudi Arabia, denounced Western intervention and nation-building, receiving applause but also criticism. He stated that the U.S. would no longer lecture other nations on how to live, urging countries in the Middle East to chart their own destinies. While some praised his remarks as a departure from past American policies, others expressed concern about the potential evaporation of pressure over human rights violations. Trump also met with the new leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist, drawing further controversy.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision, driven by higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty, does not mean California is backing away from its support for immigrants. Under Newsom's plan, new applications for Medi-Cal will be frozen, and existing enrollees will have to pay a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. The changes are estimated to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>

These groups are pressuring the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions or pull the drug from the market. Kennedy's decision is based on a paper by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims higher complication rates from mifepristone, though medical experts have scrutinized the paper's methodology. This move aligns with Project 2025, which seeks to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills and revoke mifepristone's approval.</p>
