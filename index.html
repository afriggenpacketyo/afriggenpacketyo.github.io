He also referenced the cancellation of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and emphasized curbing illegal immigration. Trump repeated unfounded claims about Russia stealing US hypersonic missile technology and warned against losing momentum in life, using an anecdote about William Levitt's retirement.</p>

The article relays the podcast host's claim that Hudson coordinated the opening of the interview and closely monitored Belichick's responses, particularly when personal topics were broached. This account contrasts with Belichick's defense of Hudson, where he accused CBS of creating a false narrative through selectively edited clips regarding her involvement in another interview. Belichick has credited Hudson with being the business mind behind his brand and has cleared the air on Hudson's reported involvement with "Hard Knocks."</p>
