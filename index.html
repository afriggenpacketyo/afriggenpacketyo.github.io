          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose significant new tariffs on 14 countries by August 1 if trade deals are not reached. The move extends a previous deadline, with Japan and South Korea facing 25% tariffs, while other nations like Myanmar and Thailand face even steeper rates of up to 40%. This policy is intended to pressure trade partners into negotiating agreements more favorable to the U.S. but has raised concerns among economists about potential inflation and hindered economic growth.

          <p>A research team in China claims to have developed a revolutionary radio communication system that could make military units electronically invisible. The technology reportedly allows for the high-speed transmission of data from sources like tanks or aircraft without emitting any active electromagnetic signals. This breakthrough, described by one expert as a form of "telepathy," could fundamentally change electronic warfare by eliminating the risk of forces revealing their location when communicating on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>The small industrial town of Byrnihat in northeast India has been identified as the world's most polluted city in a 2024 report, with air quality over 25 times worse than WHO safety guidelines. The severe pollution is attributed to a combination of factors including emissions from numerous iron and steel factories, heavy truck traffic on a national highway, and a bowl-shaped geography that traps pollutants. The report highlights a sharp rise in respiratory illnesses and cancers in the region, drawing attention to the overlooked environmental crises in smaller urban centers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that the Trump administration is using the Guantanamo Bay naval base to hold immigration detainees from 26 countries, including many with serious criminal convictions. This marks a significant expansion of the base's use beyond holding war-on-terror prisoners. The policy has drawn sharp criticism from civil rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers, who argue it is unlawful and punitive to hold civil detainees in a facility outside U.S. territory known for its controversial history.</p>

          <p>A new report from England's children's commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, describes children living in "Dickensian" poverty, with some facing rat-infested homes and a lack of basic necessities like food and washing facilities. The report calls for urgent government action, specifically demanding the removal of the two-child benefit cap, which is seen as a primary driver of this hardship. The findings underscore a worsening crisis that charities say is leading to the return of malnutrition-related diseases like rickets.</p>

          <p>The first report from the inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has revealed the "disastrous" and traumatic impact on sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted. The findings confirm that senior figures at the Post Office and Fujitsu knew the Horizon system had errors yet maintained it was robust, leading to wrongful convictions and immense suffering, including more than a dozen potential suicides. The report also criticizes the unjustifiable delays and adversarial nature of the compensation schemes for victims.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is facing significant headwinds after experiencing its worst first-half performance since 1973, declining 10.7% against global currencies. Factors contributing to the slide include policy volatility, swelling national debt, and the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. While a weaker dollar can aid U.S. exports, its continued decline is fueling broader concerns about the long-term stability of American assets and their central role in the global economy.

          <p>According to the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the annual cost of the state pension "triple lock" policy is projected to be three times higher than original estimates by the end of the decade. The policy, which guarantees the state pension rises with the highest of inflation, wages, or 2.5%, has become significantly more expensive due to economic volatility. The OBR warns this escalating cost is placing the UK's public finances in a "relatively vulnerable position." (not investment advice)</p>
