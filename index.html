          <p>The Trump administration is reviewing Harvard University's federally funded research programs, threatening to revoke the school's valuable patents. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick alleges that Harvard has violated legal requirements tied to this federal funding and has initiated a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to seize the patents. This action escalates a conflict that began with the administration accusing Harvard of civil rights violations over its handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests, leading to the university suing the government after research funds were frozen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise relaxation and health benefits is facing scrutiny from health experts. While consumers enjoy these drinks as alcohol alternatives, dietitians and nutritionists are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine they contain are sufficient to produce the advertised effects. An ad by a leading brand, Trip, was recently banned for making unproven health claims, highlighting the debate over their efficacy. Psychologists suggest the calming effect may be more of a placebo, derived from the ritual of taking a moment for a personal treat.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last newspaper hawker in France, is set to receive the Order of Merit, one of the nation's highest honors, from President Emmanuel Macron. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has sold newspapers on the streets of Paris's Left Bank, a familiar figure who has witnessed the decline of print media firsthand. Despite the drop in sales from 80 copies an hour in his prime to around 30 per day now, he continues for the joy and freedom the job provides. He fondly recalls the neighborhood's vibrant past and its famous figures, including a young Macron.</p>

          <p>Residents of Pampa Clemesí, a small settlement in Peru, live in darkness despite being located next to the country's largest solar complex. The Rubí and Clemesí solar plants generate enough electricity to power over 350,000 homes, yet the village's 150 inhabitants are not connected to the national grid. While the plant's operator, Orygen, states it has invested $800,000 to build a dedicated power line, the final connection to homes is a government responsibility that remains unfulfilled. This forces residents to rely on torches, gas stoves, and burning scrap material for daily life, highlighting a stark paradox in Peru's renewable energy boom.</p>

          <p>The Frederick County Board of Education is updating its policies to comply with a new Maryland state law requiring schools to facilitate student telehealth appointments during the school day by the 2025-26 school year. The proposed regulation would allow students to attend virtual medical or mental health appointments in a designated, supervised space on campus. The school system's role is limited to providing the location and access, not the healthcare itself, with parents required to schedule the appointments and be present. This initiative aims to provide equitable access to healthcare while minimizing disruption to students' education.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who had been released by Rhode Island authorities despite facing multiple child sex crime charges. Josue Santiago Perez Gomez was charged with patronizing a minor for commercial sexual activity and other related offenses. Although ICE had filed an immigration detainer, he was released by local police, prompting his rearrest by federal agents hours later. An ICE official criticized the local authorities' decision, stating Perez Gomez posed a clear threat to the community. He will now remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Qatar's prime minister in Spain to discuss a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The framework reportedly involves the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the territory. This diplomatic effort comes as Israel faces international condemnation for its plan to expand military operations into Gaza City, a move many nations warn would worsen the humanitarian crisis and endanger the hostages. Meanwhile, families of the hostages are pressuring the Israeli government to prioritize a deal to secure their release.</p>

          <p>A man in Leicestershire received a £165 parking penalty after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. Richard Lynn paid to park his Hyundai for 30 minutes, but the system's photographic evidence showed his car entering and a different car, a Kia with a nearly identical license plate, leaving nine hours later. The private firm, Horizon Parking, initially sent demands to an old address, which escalated before he was notified. The company claims it has since rectified the error, but Mr. Lynn expressed frustration over the automated, aggressive process and the lack of human oversight.</p>

          <p>Musician Ed Sheeran recently sparked a debate after describing himself as "culturally Irish," despite being born and raised in England. The statement drew some criticism online but also highlighted the complex and evolving nature of cultural identity, especially for those in the Irish diaspora with strong family ties to the country. Experts note that in the post-Good Friday Agreement era, identity is less binary, allowing for blended "or both" affiliations. The discussion encompasses the broad spectrum of what "Irishness" means today, from the experiences of second-generation immigrants to the shared cultural touchstones that cross political and geographical borders.</p>

Nigerien officials and heritage advocates argue the export was illegal and a violation of the nation's laws protecting cultural and natural heritage.

Experts suggest there's a charm in watching earnestly made films that fail spectacularly, offering a unique and often humorous viewing experience. This phenomenon has created cult followings for movies like "The Room" and "Samurai Cop," which are celebrated for their unintentional comedy and visible production flaws.</p>

The app's release briefly wiped billions from Nvidia's market value and challenged the "bigger is better" philosophy dominating American AI development. While no longer a headline-grabber, DeepSeek demonstrated that smaller, more efficient models could be highly competitive, influencing OpenAI's recent release of smaller, open models. However, concerns about data security and the company's ties to Beijing persist, and the American tech industry has largely returned to a focus on massive-scale AI investment.

Widespread heat advisories also stretch across the Plains and are building in the Northwest, with record highs possible in several cities. In addition to the heat, critical fire weather alerts are active in four western states due to low humidity and gusty winds, which could lead to the rapid spread of wildfires.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has started her partnership with new coach Francisco Roig with a win, defeating Olga Danilovic 6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the Cincinnati Open. After a slow start, Raducanu demonstrated strong defense and returning, capitalizing on her opponent's errors to secure a comfortable victory in the sweltering heat. This win continues her recent solid form against lower-ranked players and sets up a challenging third-round match against either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova. Raducanu appears more match-tough and confident as she continues her North American hard-court season.</p>

          <p>The chief financial officer of Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Dawn Norton, who held the $210,000-a-year job in Wilton, claims she had been working remotely and had kept town leadership informed of her plans. However, Wilton officials state they were unaware she had accepted a second full-time public office and would not have approved it. The discovery came as Wilton's finance department was already under review for issues including chronic understaffing and "material weakness" found by auditors.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign nationals after they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, criminals with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away, with the decision on whether they serve their time left to their destination country. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. The plan, which excludes those with life sentences, has been criticized by the opposition, who warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA for a social media tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid that omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid, known as the "Pele of Palestinian football," was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for aid in Gaza. In response to UEFA's post calling al-Obeid a "talent who gave hope," Salah posted on X, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?"

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, suggesting people over 50 should eat more of the fruit to support healthy brain aging. Pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fruit can be costly and seasonal, pomegranate extract is an alternative, though consumers should choose versions without added sugar. Individuals on certain medications should consult a doctor before adding pomegranates to their diet.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Parliament Square and deliberately courted arrest by displaying signs with messages supporting the proscribed organization. The government banned the group in July after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. While the Home Secretary defended the ban, rights groups like Amnesty International called the mass arrests "deeply concerning" and a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long after only two months was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over sharing confidential taxpayer data. The administration had requested the IRS cross-reference a list of 40,000 suspected undocumented immigrants to verify their addresses as part of a broader immigration crackdown. The IRS declined to share the information it found, citing taxpayer privacy rights and its statutory obligations. This conflict highlights growing pressure on federal agencies to align with administration priorities, following similar pressures at other government bureaus. (not investment advice)</p>

Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for a potential club-record fee but struggled to find consistent form, scoring 40 goals in 143 appearances. Despite memorable moments, including several crucial late winners, he was often used as a substitute and fell out of favor under new head coach Arne Slot.
