          <p>US President Donald Trump has initiated a broad program of tariffs on imported goods, asserting they will bolster American manufacturing, safeguard jobs, and reduce the nation's trade deficit. These taxes, which are a percentage of a product's value, have been applied with varying rates to different countries and goods, often as a negotiating tactic to secure more favorable trade deals. While Trump asserts the policy is effective, critics highlight the resulting global economic volatility, including stock market fluctuations and increased prices for US consumers as businesses pass on higher import costs. International bodies like the IMF and OECD have consequently lowered their global economic growth forecasts for 2025, underscoring the significant global impact of these trade measures.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, the storm's long-term shadow persists for its youngest survivors, now adults. The disaster, which claimed 1,200 lives and left the city submerged, disproportionately affected poor and predominantly Black neighborhoods, causing widespread displacement and mental health issues among children. Many survivors, like filmmaker E'jaaz Mason, struggled with the trauma for years, prompting the documentary "Katrina Babies" to explore these untold stories and foster community healing. Despite infrastructure upgrades, New Orleans remains vulnerable to climate change, with experts warning against narratives of "resilience" that may absolve those in power from addressing future preparedness.</p>

The Bundeswehr needs 80,000 additional professional soldiers and 140,000 reservists to fulfill its NATO obligations, a requirement amplified by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. While the government emphasizes voluntary recruitment, the reintroduction of compulsory military service, suspended in 2011, remains a possibility if current expansion plans prove insufficient.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, labeling them "incompetent" amidst a deadly weekend in Chicago with six fatalities and 27 injuries. Trump proposed deploying the National Guard to combat the city's crime, a suggestion met with strong opposition from Pritzker and Johnson, who argue against militarizing the city. While official statistics show a decrease in some crime categories year-over-year, overall crime has increased significantly since 2021, and Chicago was recently named the "nation's homicide capital" for the 13th consecutive year. The debate highlights differing approaches to public safety between federal and local leadership.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households are set to experience a 2% increase in gas and electricity prices starting in October, pushing the typical annual energy bill up by £35 to £1,755, according to energy regulator Ofgem. This rise, which exceeded analysts' expectations, is primarily driven by higher costs for energy transportation and new government-mandated consumer support initiatives. Campaigners express concern about another winter of elevated energy bills, compounding the struggles of many families and the existing £4 billion energy debt. While some consumers might consider fixed-price deals, the increase disproportionately impacts those on standard credit and prepayment meters, underscoring persistent cost-of-living pressures across the nation.</p>

          <p>A US Air Force F-35 fighter jet crashed in Alaska earlier this year after its pilot spent 50 minutes on an airborne conference call with Lockheed Martin engineers, attempting to resolve a critical landing gear malfunction. The accident report attributed the crash to ice in the hydraulic lines, which prevented proper deployment. Despite the pilot's repeated "touch and go" landing attempts and the engineers' remote guidance, the jet's computer systems unexpectedly transitioned to "automated ground-operation mode" while still airborne, rendering it uncontrollable and forcing the pilot to eject safely. The $200 million aircraft was destroyed, and the investigation highlighted issues with crew decision-making and oversight of hydraulic fluid maintenance.</p>

The tiny 1.2-inch piece, originally found in Norway in 1796 and subsequently forgotten in archives, depicts a meticulously well-groomed man featuring an imperial mustache, a braided beard, and a neatly styled hairstyle. Curator Peter Pentz suggests this figure, possibly a board game piece representing a king, could even be King Harald Bluetooth, as elaborate hairstyles were indicative of wealth and status during the era. Its detailed carvings and unique, smiling expression distinctly set it apart from other, more simplistic Viking depictions.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is grappling with a "ridiculous" and "controversial" decision as he contemplates selecting himself for the team, a move that would be unprecedented for a playing captain in 62 years. Bradley, a highly-ranked American golfer who narrowly missed the last Ryder Cup selection, is tasked with announcing his six wildcard picks a month before the biennial contest against Europe. While his deep passion for the American cause is clear, his dual role as captain and potential player raises questions about the team's optimal strategy to reclaim the trophy. This highly scrutinized decision underscores the unique challenges Bradley faces in balancing his personal aspirations with the team's success.</p>

          <p>Several employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have been placed on administrative leave following their signing of a public dissent letter, dubbed the "Katrina Declaration," which sharply criticized the Trump administration's reductions in agency staff and programs. More than 180 current and former FEMA personnel signed the letter, cautioning that the agency's ability to effectively respond to major disasters had been significantly compromised. Although the official notice stated the leave was not disciplinary, it did not explicitly connect it to the opposition letter. This incident reflects ongoing tensions over government policies impacting critical public services, echoing similar dissent seen in other federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Hostilities between Israel and the Houthis have dramatically escalated following a massive Israeli air strike on the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which targeted key military installations including the presidential palace, power stations, and a fuel depot. This intense retaliatory strike occurred after the Houthis fired a missile equipped with internationally prohibited cluster bombs at Israel, signifying a dangerous qualitative escalation. Houthi authorities reported six fatalities and 90 injuries, including numerous civilians. The Houthis, supported by Iran, have consistently attacked Israel since October 2023, aiming to demonstrate solidarity with Palestinians and leverage international attention for their ongoing civil war, which also significantly impacts global trade through threats to Red Sea shipping lanes.</p>

          <p>Russia's economy, grappling with slowing growth, a widening budget deficit, and inflationary pressures, could become a significant factor in President Vladimir Putin's approach to peace negotiations with Ukraine. Despite Moscow's current reluctance for a ceasefire, the finance ministry reported a 4.88 trillion ruble deficit and a 20.8% surge in government spending, largely on defense. Declining oil export revenues and lower global demand may necessitate spending cuts or tax increases, risking a prolonged recession. While the central bank has tried to tame inflation, the overall economic strain and potential for anemic growth could pressure the Kremlin to reconsider its stance on the ongoing conflict.

Lee had suggested that the alliance between the US and South Korea would "upgrade to a global level" once a clear path for denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula emerged. Pyongyang, however, dismissed his comments as a "naive dream," firmly reiterating its "irreversible" status as a nuclear state, citing perceived hostile external threats. The article also notes US President Donald Trump's expressed desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again this year, highlighting the complex and often contradictory diplomatic landscape surrounding the Korean Peninsula.</p>

This action follows a British newspaper report alleging the IDF utilized Microsoft's Azure cloud platform for mass surveillance data storage.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw delivered another masterful performance on the mound, pitching five innings of one-run ball to secure his fifth consecutive victory as the Dodgers triumphed over the Cincinnati Reds 6-3. Despite a notably diminished fastball, the 37-year-old left-hander impressively retired 14 consecutive batters, employing a creative and varied mix of pitches, including his slider, curveball, and new splitter, to effectively keep the Reds' entirely right-handed lineup off-balance. The Dodgers' offense steadily contributed throughout the game, erasing an early deficit and decisively breaking the game open with a four-run rally in the sixth inning. This crucial win maintained the Dodgers' one-game lead in the tightly contested National League West, underscoring their strong late-season momentum.</p>

          <p>A recent report from SAP Concur reveals a contrasting trend in travel to the United States: while leisure travel has declined this year, business travel to the country remains robust and even registered a slight increase. The U.S. emerged as the leading destination for global business travelers in the first half of 2025, capturing 15% of all business air travel bookings, a figure significantly higher than other nations. This pattern, corroborated by data from additional travel firms, suggests that the prevailing negative travel sentiment impacting other global regions is not affecting corporate interests in the United States.

          <p>India is responding to the new 50% tariffs imposed by the US with a promise of tax cuts and a strong push for domestic self-reliance, termed "Swadeshi" or "Made in India." These tariffs, enacted by President Donald Trump over India's Russian oil purchases, make India one of the most heavily taxed countries by the US, threatening its exports and growth. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a "massive tax bonanza" for citizens and small businesses, alongside plans for a simplified two-tier GST system to boost consumption. This fiscal stimulus aims to mitigate the economic blow, particularly for export-driven industries and private consumption, which is a mainstay of India's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies are inadvertently reshaping global alliances, prompting a discernible counter-reaction and a deepening rift with nations in the Global South. Originally aimed at asserting US economic dominance, these tariffs, often imposed via questionable executive orders, are now seen as a means to impose political will unrelated to trade. Leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, and China are discussing collective protection, potentially through the BRICS alliance, to bypass US economic leverage and safeguard national sovereignty. This shift could lead to a more ideologically coherent anti-Western bloc, with countries like Brazil recalibrating their multi-alignment strategy in response to Trump's escalating demands.</p>
