          <p>The US State Department has controversially removed its online Human Rights Reporting Gateway, a crucial public channel for reporting alleged human rights violations by US-armed foreign forces. Human rights advocates and a senior congressional aide, who drafted the law mandating such a channel, have condemned the move, arguing it undermines accountability and transparency. The department maintains it adheres to legal requirements and engages with credible organizations. Critics suggest this action aligns with an "America First" foreign policy, potentially weakening the US's ability to deter abuses like extrajudicial killings, torture, and sexual assault abroad, as seen in past allegations involving Colombian forces and IDF raids.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani (Democrat), Andrew Cuomo (Independent), and Curtis Sliwa (Republican) engaged in a heated final debate, trading barbs on critical topics. Mamdani faced scrutiny over past anti-Israel rhetoric, while Cuomo's sexual assault allegations resurfaced. The candidates also discussed a recent federal immigration raid in Chinatown, with all three criticizing the Trump administration's jurisdiction. Despite a Fox News poll showing Mamdani with a significant lead, the race remains dynamic, with national attention focused on the outcome. All three candidates surprisingly agreed to retain current NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, signaling a shared commitment to public safety.</p>

          <h2>Novel Clinical Trial Targets 'Sleeper Cells' to Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:50:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are making significant strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells." These cells, which can break away from primary tumors and later cause cancer to spread, were identified in patients' bone marrow. A clinical trial, led by Dr. Angela DeMichele, showed remarkable success: only two out of 51 women experienced cancer recurrence after seven years, far below the expected average. This groundbreaking approach offers new hope for patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who faced aggressive triple-negative breast cancer. The next phase involves larger trials to confirm these promising results and explore applicability to other cancer types.</p>

          <h2>Lebanon Records World's Fastest Rising Cancer Rates Amid Environmental and Lifestyle Factors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:49:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lebanon is facing a severe public health crisis, with the world's fastest-rising rates of cancer incidence and mortality, according to a study in The Lancet. New cancer cases have surged by 162% since 1990, and deaths by 80%, largely attributed to poor air quality from vehicle exhaust and diesel generators, overuse of agricultural chemicals, and alarmingly high smoking rates. Public health campaigns against tobacco are absent, and the government even profits from its sale. Lawmakers have invited co-author Ali Mokdad to discuss the findings, prompting the formation of a committee to address health screening, public smoking bans, and anti-tobacco advertising. Urgent action is needed to reverse these troubling trends.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring formal approval for nearly all Department of Defense interactions and correspondence with Congress. This new policy mandates that offices, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders, route all legislative affairs activities through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs. The move has raised serious questions about transparency and the timely flow of information essential for congressional oversight, according to Senator Jack Reed. The administration justifies the directive by stating it prevents unauthorized engagements from undermining department-wide legislative priorities, though critics fear it further centralizes control and limits accountability.</p>

          <p>An Australian MP has controversially used parliamentary privilege to name a man, previously known as Mercury, as a person of interest in the 1970 disappearance of three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer. Cheryl was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach, and despite a 2017 murder charge against Mercury based on a 1971 confession, the case was dropped due to inadmissible evidence. The family, who were present in parliament, has been relentlessly pushing for a new inquiry. They recently issued an ultimatum to Mercury, urging him to explain his knowledge of the case. The NSW parliament has now announced an inquiry into long-term missing persons cases, including Cheryl's, to review past investigations and improve future outcomes.</p>

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was known to be carrying narcotics along a trafficking route, and no US forces were harmed.

President Trump defends the actions as necessary counter-narcotics measures, designating cartels as terrorist organizations, and has threatened further escalation on land. The strikes have fueled tensions with countries like Colombia, whose president Trump has criticized, and raised questions about the legality of lethal force in international waters from UN experts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to demolish the White House's East Wing to construct a new ballroom, a project now estimated at $300 million, to be funded by private donors. This marks a significant reversal from earlier assurances that the project would not interfere with the existing structure, which was built in 1902. The demolition has already begun, impacting offices and suspending public tours. Historical preservation groups have voiced strong opposition, calling for a public review process and expressing concern that the massive addition will overwhelm the White House's historical integrity.

          <p>Sophisticated cargo theft rings are costing the US economy up to $35 billion annually, with criminals posing as legitimate trucking companies to steal millions of dollars in goods. These schemes often involve identity theft and tricking shippers into handing over entire container loads. For example, Ari Bikes lost 350 bicycles, and Santo Tequila, owned by Guy Fieri, lost 24,000 bottles of tequila through such operations. Law enforcement officials emphasize the difficulty in detection, as these heists initially appear as legitimate transactions.

While campaigners applaud the move, concerns remain about the low uptake of general health checks, particularly in marginalized communities, which could limit the impact.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in a significant policy shift aimed at pressuring Moscow to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the sanctions are a response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's "refusal to end this senseless war," following months of bipartisan pressure. The move comes after an intense Russian bombardment on Ukraine killed at least seven people, including children, hours after a planned Trump-Putin meeting was shelved. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised the sanctions, emphasizing the need for sustained pressure to bring Putin to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>New port fees enacted by the Trump administration have unexpectedly burdened Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a US-based ocean carrier, with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill. The company's unique hybrid vessels, which carry containers, roll-on/roll-off freight, and oversized cargo, were reclassified under Section 301 program terms, leading to a fee based on net tonnage rather than cargo type. ACL CEO Andrew Abbott expressed shock, stating the company may be forced to relocate operations, impacting US importers and exporters who rely on its specialized service. The USTR has indicated no change in the rules, despite ACL being the only US-headquartered carrier on the transatlantic route, raising concerns about its viability.</p>

Personal stories from students like Evie, Arav, and Betsey highlight the challenges of navigating the current system, including lack of suitable placements and late diagnoses.
