          <h2>Nvidia CEO Warns Huawei Could Dominate China's AI Chip Market if U.S. Restrictions Continue</h2>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that Huawei could dominate the Chinese market if the U.S. continues to restrict AI semiconductor exports to China. Huang acknowledged Nvidia's technological lead but cautioned that Huawei could fill the void if the U.S. doesn't participate in the Chinese market. This comes as China focuses on developing domestic firms like Huawei to build its own AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. export curbs. Despite this, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei admitted their single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation, downplaying Huawei's achievements and emphasizing the need for continued hard work. The situation highlights the ongoing tech competition between the U.S. and China in the AI sector. </p>

          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly considering acquiring some of BP's liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets, adding to speculation about a potential takeover of the energy major. ADNOC's interest comes as BP faces underperformance relative to industry peers, making it a takeover target for companies like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. Analysts note the long-standing relationship between ADNOC and BP across hydrocarbons and renewables, particularly in Abu Dhabi and Egypt. BP is seeking to restore investor confidence through a strategic reset, including increasing oil and gas spending while reducing renewables investment, and targeting $20 billion in divestments. </p>

          <p>Large-scale anti-tourism protests are planned across Spain as residents express frustration over overcrowded city centers and housing shortages. The coalition Sur de Europa contra la Turistización has called for demonstrations in cities like Barcelona, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands. Activists argue that the current tourism model prioritizes the industry over the quality of life for locals, leading to issues like noisy streets, air pollution, and rising rents. While the tourism industry generates a significant portion of Barcelona's GDP and supports jobs, many jobs are precarious and wages are below average, leading to complaints that dependence on tourism impoverishes the population. The protests aim to spark a debate about the limits of tourism and improve the lives of residents. </p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog IAEA has condemned Iran for failing to comply with its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in two decades. The agency's board of governors passed a resolution drafted by the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, citing Iran's failure to cooperate fully regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities. Iran responded by announcing plans to open a new enrichment site and upgrade centrifuges at the Fordow nuclear facility. This move could escalate tensions between the West and Iran over its nuclear program and potentially lead to the restoration of United Nations sanctions on Tehran later this year. </p>

Bank of America reported outflows from U.S. equities and inflows into European stocks, while Morningstar data showed investors withdrawing from U.S. equity ETFs and shifting funds into European ETFs.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is promoting France as a critical tech hub in Europe, with the ambition to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world. Macron's comments come as European tech companies reassess their reliance on foreign technology firms for critical technology and infrastructure. He highlighted that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France, expressing his desire for France to produce semiconductors in the range of 2 nanometers to 10 nanometers. Macron touted a deal between Thales, Radiall, and Taiwan's Foxconn to explore setting up a semiconductor assembly and test facility in France. </p>

          <p>The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claims that Hamas killed five of its Palestinian staff in an attack on a bus in Gaza. The GHF, which began delivering aid to Gaza last month, said the attack occurred as the bus was traveling to a distribution center. The organization alleges that Hamas had been threatening its team for days, and that some workers may have been taken hostage. The Israeli military shared part of the GHF's statement, accusing Hamas of preventing the effective delivery of aid. </p>

          <p>Oman's Foreign Minister announced that a sixth round of negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will be held this Sunday in Muscat. The announcement comes amid heightened regional tensions and as the U.S. is drawing down non-essential staff from its Middle East embassies due to potential unrest. Reaching a deal is a diplomatic priority for the U.S., potentially leading to the lifting of some economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limiting its uranium enrichment. Failure to reach an agreement could further escalate tensions in the Middle East. </p>

          <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has warned that several Jolly Rancher sweets are unsafe to eat due to the presence of chemical compounds, mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH), which are not compliant with UK laws. The FSA says that MOAH can cause damage to DNA and potentially increase the risk of cancer, particularly if consumed in high quantities over a prolonged period of time. The Hershey Company has been working with the UK government to remove the affected products from the UK market since 2024, but some businesses continue to import them. The affected products include Jolly Rancher Hard Candy, Jolly Rancher 'Misfits' Gummies, Jolly Rancher Hard Candy Fruity 2 in 1, and Jolly Ranchers Berry Gummies. </p>

The US State Department stated it is constantly assessing personnel posture at all embassies and decided to reduce the mission's footprint in Iraq.

While this is China’s first pilot production line for photonic chips, it is already showing gains in terms of technical performance by overcoming a global limit for high-speed optical links.

An undercover BBC reporter visited 21 stores and found that almost half continued to sell the vapes as though there had been no law change. Single-use vapes were a key driver behind the alarming rise in youth vaping, prompting the ban to protect children's health and reduce environmental damage. Shop owners risk a £200 fine, with repeat offenders facing jail, but some are selling off remaining stock at a discount despite the ban having been announced months prior. </p>

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will amend regulations to prevent overseas transfers from being used to park money in time deposits or other interest-bearing accounts abroad. The proposed changes reflect India's cautious stance on a rise in outward remittances and full convertibility of the rupee. Overseas investments by individuals fall under the central bank's Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), which allows resident Indians to remit up to $250,000 in a single year.
