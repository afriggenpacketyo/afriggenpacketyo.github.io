            <p>Britannia Jinky Jersey, the parent company of Pontins holiday parks, has been charged with corporate manslaughter following the death of Wendy Jones. Jones, 68, died after an air conditioning duct collapsed at Pontins Brean Sands in 2019, injuring eighteen others. The incident occurred inside the entertainment center, called The Fun Factory, leading to Jones spending the last six months of her life in hospital. The company is scheduled to appear in court next month regarding the incident that happened several years ago.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. This declaration came after Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated the decision was El Salvador's. Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a terrorist and said he lacks the authority to return him. The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation was an administrative error, and Abrego Garcia's lawyers maintain he has no gang affiliation. The situation raises legal and ethical questions about deportation practices and international cooperation.</p>

            <p>President Trump condemned the arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's home but his statement is being viewed skeptically given his past rhetoric. The suspect, Cody Balmer, harbored hatred toward Shapiro and expressed anti-government views. While Republicans joined in condemning the attack, Trump's history of praising violence and leveraging its threat for political gain undermines the sincerity of his condemnation. Critics point to Trump's past remarks about Greg Gianforte and the Proud Boys as examples of his willingness to condone or even encourage political violence.</p>

            <p>Stock prices for Apple, Alphabet, and other Silicon Valley tech companies rebounded after the Trump administration announced exemptions for electronics from reciprocal tariffs. However, this boost may be temporary as tech giants could still face changes to their supply chains and costs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that these products could be subject to tariffs affecting the semiconductor sector in the near future. Amid pressure from the White House, Apple and Nvidia have announced plans to bring more jobs to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is misrepresenting a Supreme Court decision regarding Kilmar Abrego García, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. Despite the court's order to "facilitate" his release, officials claim the US is powerless to return him. Trump's policy chief, Stephen Miller, suggests bringing Abrego García back would be akin to kidnapping a citizen of El Salvador. The administration's actions contradict the court order and raise concerns about compliance with legal mandates.</p>

The federal response is under scrutiny due to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s history of spreading false information about vaccines. The expert believes the department isn't doing enough to combat the outbreak.</p>

            <p>Concerns are rising about whether China's second-quarter GDP will experience another "summer blue" period, following a strong "open door red" start. Last summer saw a significant slowdown after robust first-quarter growth. Similar declines in quarterly growth have occurred in previous years. China is set to release its first-quarter GDP growth, with economists estimating an average growth of 5.16 percent. The question remains whether this momentum can be sustained through the summer months. (not investment advice)</p>
