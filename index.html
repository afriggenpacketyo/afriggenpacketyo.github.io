          <p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi has issued a warning from Tehran, stating that the Iranian government is exploiting the recent conflict with Israel to intensify its crackdown on citizens. She highlights a surge in executions and arrests, particularly targeting political and civil activists, as a tactic to instill fear and divert attention from internal policy failures. Mohammadi condemns the Israeli strike on Evin Prison but expresses greater concern over the subsequent securitization and inhumane conditions for transferred prisoners. She calls for renewed international focus on Iran's human rights abuses, emphasizing that the fight for democracy continues despite the regime's oppressive measures.</p>

          <p>A targeted drive-by shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood has resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. The incident occurred as a crowd was leaving an album release party for rapper Mello Buckzz, with some victims reportedly being part of the rapper's inner circle. Police believe three shooters using at least two different caliber weapons were involved and are investigating the possibility of gang-related motives, preparing for potential retaliation. The venue has been shut down by the city, and officials are appealing to the public for any information regarding the attack.</p>

          <p>North Korea has condemned the U.S. Department of Justice for exposing a massive scheme where North Korean IT workers infiltrated over 100 American companies, including Fortune 500 firms. The DOJ alleges that these workers, using false identities and assistance from facilitators in the U.S. and other countries, generated over $5 million to fund the DPRK regime. A spokesperson for North Korea's Foreign Ministry labeled the U.S. actions an "absurd smear campaign" and a violation of its sovereignty, accusing the U.S. of creating global cyberspace instability. The DOJ has unsealed indictments against multiple individuals and seized web domains and financial accounts connected to the operation.</p>

          <p>The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from the country's securities market, citing claims of market manipulation. The regulator has also issued an interim order to impound approximately $566.3 million in what it deems illegal profits. SEBI alleges that Jane Street employed manipulative strategies to artificially influence the Nifty 50 index, enabling it to profit from large positions in index options. The firm allegedly persisted with these practices even after receiving an explicit advisory from the regulator, prompting the stringent enforcement action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large coalition of more than 175 Democratic members of Congress is legally challenging the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Department of Education. They have filed an amicus brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit, arguing that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish a federal agency established by law. The brief contends that the administration's actions, including significant workforce reductions and the termination of grant programs, violate the separation of powers. Lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jamie Raskin assert that only Congress can restructure or eliminate federal agencies, and they are moving to protect the department's mission.</p>

The contamination is attributed to street runoff increasing bacterial counts, which poses a risk of illness and skin infections, particularly for children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Department of the Interior to develop a strategy for increasing entrance fees for non-U.S. residents at national parks. The order aims to generate additional revenue for park improvements while maintaining lower prices for American citizens, under an "America first" policy for the parks. The administration estimates this surcharge could generate over $90 million annually. The order also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access systems like lotteries or permitting and revokes a 2017 Obama-era memorandum focused on promoting diversity and inclusion within the national parks system.</p>

While market leader BYD reported a 31% sales growth, its recent price cuts have drawn criticism from competitors like Great Wall Motors, who warn of unsustainable competition. This "involution," or meaningless race to the bottom, has led to industry-wide losses and pushed automakers to seek profits overseas, prompting tariff threats from the U.S. and EU.

This trend contradicts administration claims of focusing on "the worst of the worst," as exemplified by the recent deportation of a Guatemalan pastor who had lived in the U.S. for 30 years without a criminal history. The findings suggest a broad enforcement push where being in the country without legal status is sufficient cause for detention.</p>

          <p>Prominent British soccer agent Jonathan Barnett has been sued by a woman who alleges he sexually assaulted her and held her as a "sex slave" for several years. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles, accuses Barnett of using his position and company resources to coerce and control the plaintiff, referred to as Jane Doe. The complaint also names Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and its sports division, CAA Stellar, alleging they "turned a blind eye" to the abuse. Barnett has vehemently denied the allegations as untrue, while CAA stated it takes the claims seriously but that the plaintiff had no business connection to the agency.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's policy direction under the Trump administration. The employees' letter argued that the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment, citing rollbacks of pollution rules and cuts to climate science funding. In response, the EPA accused the career staff of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions. The move represents a rare and forceful public clash between an administration and its own scientific and professional staff.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's recently announced plan to eliminate 9,000 jobs has resulted in 830 layoffs in its headquarters state of Washington. According to a state filing, the cuts affected a wide range of roles, including staff in game design, research, legal, hardware engineering, and sales. The layoffs are part of a broader company strategy to reduce redundancy and refocus on key growth areas like cloud services, which remains the company's fastest-growing segment. The cuts to the Xbox division come as revenue from its content and services has been lagging behind the company's overall growth rate, signaling a strategic realignment.</p>

The report highlighted a lack of "basic information" and "little curiosity" about the system's operation, despite over a million people applying through this route.

While an MRI revealed no structural damage, providing some relief, the absence of Muncy is a significant blow to the team's lineup. He was a key offensive contributor, leading the team in batting average and RBIs in June, and his injury adds to the Dodgers' already extensive list of 13 players on the IL.</p>

Nonpartisan analysis predicts these changes could cause millions to lose health and food benefits, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating up to 11.8 million people could lose Medicaid coverage.

While Vought did not write the legislation, its deep cuts to programs like Medicaid align with his long-term vision of shrinking the federal government and dismantling what he views as an unconstitutional administrative state. Coppins notes that Vought's goal is less about fiscal conservatism, as the bill adds trillions to the deficit, and more about a radical reordering of government power. Vought's "post-constitutional" ideology suggests a desire to concentrate more power within the presidency.</p>

The economy has seen minimal growth, and major reforms to social care have been delayed.
