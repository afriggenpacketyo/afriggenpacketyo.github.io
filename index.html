          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned from his position as chairman of Reform UK, expressing his belief that working towards a Reform government is no longer a valuable use of his time. Yusuf, who previously served as a Conservative Party member and a banker, played a crucial role in the party's recent electoral successes, including winning a by-election and gaining new councillors. His resignation comes after he criticized a Reform MP's call to ban the burka, highlighting internal disagreements within the party. Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed his regret over Yusuf's departure, acknowledging his significant contributions to the party's progress and describing him as a loss to public life, as Yusuf had also donated Â£200,000 to the party during the election campaign. The resignation reflects potential challenges and internal conflicts within the Reform UK party. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk and President Donald Trump are engaged in a public dispute over Trump's tax bill, with Musk condemning it as a "disgusting abomination" due to its potential to increase federal deficits. Trump responded by saying he was disappointed in Musk, who he claimed was upset about the elimination of EV credits in the bill and the rejection of his NASA nominee. Musk retorted that Trump would have lost the election without his support, claiming he was the biggest financial backer of Trump's 2024 campaign. This conflict highlights a significant fracture in the relationship between the two influential figures and underscores Musk's opposition to the spending bill. </p>

The union is urging Birmingham City Council to present an acceptable offer, while the council asserts it remains committed to resolving the dispute. The ongoing strikes have led to significant disruptions in bin collection services, causing concerns about public health and the environment, and this has created tensions between the union and the council. </p>

Biden dismissed Trump's memo as a distraction and affirmed that he made the decisions during his presidency. The Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project previously investigated the Biden administration's use of an autopen, leading to speculation that Biden aides had approved executive orders without the president's direct involvement. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of U.S. gun manufacturers, blocking a lawsuit filed by the Mexican government seeking to hold the companies accountable for the trafficking of their weapons into Mexico. Mexico argued that American firearms manufacturers were aiding and abetting the illicit flow of weapons across the border, contributing to violence by cartels. Justice Elena Kagan stated that federal law grants broad immunity to U.S. gun companies, protecting them from Mexico's claims. Mexico sought $10 billion in damages and court-mandated safety mechanisms, but the court determined that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege the kind of conscious participation needed to support an aiding-and-abetting charge. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declined to provide a specific deadline for a decision regarding sanctions on Russia, stating that the decision is "in my brain." Trump also discussed his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, comparing the Russia-Ukraine war to two boys fighting in a park. The situation remains uncertain as Trump weighs the potential consequences of imposing sanctions on Russia, and this lack of clarity may be contributing to instability in the region. </p>

          <p>Democrats and civil rights groups have strongly criticized Donald Trump's travel ban on 12 countries, calling it reckless, discriminatory, and reminiscent of his previous Muslim ban. Critics argue that the ban, which includes countries like Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, and Haiti, will not improve national security and may be an attempt to distract from Trump's tax bill. They also express concerns about the economic impact and the separation of families. Trump defended the ban, citing national security concerns and the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, while Democrats assert that it is rooted in bigotry and prejudice. </p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether President Joe Biden used an autopen to sign documents in office, alleging it was part of a conspiracy to cover up Biden's cognitive decline. Trump has tasked White House Counsel David Warrington and Attorney General Pam Bondi with investigating whether individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state. Biden has dismissed the allegations as ridiculous and false, stating that he made the decisions about pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations during his presidency. Trump's investigation follows renewed scrutiny into Biden's mental and physical capacity, and legal experts say the use of an autopen has no bearing on the validity of pardons or legislation. </p>
