        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump acknowledged that Americans might have to "do with less" as a result of the ongoing trade war with China, suggesting that consumers may have fewer choices and potentially pay slightly more for goods. Trump insisted that the trade war would ultimately be more detrimental to China, which relies on the U.S. market to sell its products. He argued that many of the goods imported from China are not essential for Americans, framing the trade war as a necessary step to address trade imbalances. The article notes Trump's assertion that the U.S. has been economically exploited by other countries, with China being the primary offender.</p>

          <p>Federal agencies, including the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense, are increasing their use of polygraph tests to identify potential leakers of classified information.

Experts caution that polygraphs should not be considered definitive lie detectors, as they measure physiological changes that can be triggered by various factors beyond deception.
