          <h2>Analyst Questions Apple's Strategy of Moving iPhone Assembly to India</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Craig Moffett, a leading analyst, casts doubt on Apple's plan to shift iPhone assembly from China to India, arguing it may not significantly reduce costs related to tariffs since components will still originate from China. He highlights potential resistance and supply chain anchoring in China as obstacles to diversification. Moffett also points out that carriers are unlikely to absorb tariff costs, potentially impacting consumer demand. He suggests backlash against Apple in China could further hurt iPhone sales, and has lowered his price target for Apple shares, while clarifying that it is based on valuation concerns and not the company's fundamentals.

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll indicates that voters perceive President Trump as overreaching with his executive powers and express doubts about his key policy initiatives. The early months of his administration are largely viewed as "chaotic" and "scary", even among some supporters. Voters also feel that Trump does not understand their daily struggles, leading to a decline in his approval ratings, particularly concerning the economy and immigration. While his approval rating is low for this point in his term, it mirrors his persistent unpopularity from the previous election.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions are being scrutinized for potentially benefiting Russian President Vladimir Putin, including his approach to the conflict in Ukraine and his impact on US institutions. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine seemingly favors Russia, allowing them to retain seized territories while preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. His actions have also created rifts with traditional US allies and caused changes within the US government, which align with Moscow's interests. These actions, whether intentional or not, raise concerns about the alignment of Trump's policies with Putin's objectives.</p>
