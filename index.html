          <p>Arizona's Attorney General has initiated a lawsuit against House Speaker Mike Johnson for his refusal to swear in Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who won a special congressional election. Grijalva's presence is crucial as her vote could provide the 218th signature for a discharge petition aimed at releasing the Epstein files, a move Johnson has dismissed as "totally absurd." The Attorney General argues this action denies Arizona's seventh Congressional district proper representation and treats its citizens as "second-class." This article highlights a significant political and legal dispute regarding congressional procedure, transparency, and the power dynamics within the House.</p>

          <p>Kristina Chambers, a Texas woman accused of manslaughter in a fatal drunk driving incident, is reportedly blaming her designer Christian Louboutin heels for the crash that killed Joseph McMullin. Prosecutors allege Chambers was four times over the legal alcohol limit when she struck McMullin, who was on a first date. Her attorney contends the high-end shoes became wedged on the gas pedal. This article details the ongoing trial, including witness testimony from the victim's date and a pool hall manager, alongside allegations of cocaine possession and prior instances of Chambers driving under the influence.</p>

          <p>Federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a joint crackdown in New York City's Chinatown, specifically on Canal Street.

          <p>A new study from Schroders reveals that 90% of working Americans plan to ignore the common financial advice of waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits. While delaying can significantly increase monthly payments, many workers cite insufficient retirement savings and immediate income needs as reasons to file early, with 44% expecting to do so before age 67. Concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency, projected insolvency by 2034 without changes, also influence these decisions. This article highlights a widespread financial challenge facing American retirees and the disconnect between expert advice and personal economic realities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of an anticipated summit, analysts and former US government officials are questioning whether President Donald Trump's reliance on "gut instinct" and personal chemistry will be effective in negotiations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Experts like Ryan Hass, a former China director, describe Xi as "cold-blooded" in his calculations, not easily swayed by charm. This article suggests that Trump's usual approach, which often bypasses extensive preparation, may face limitations against Xi's strategic and unemotional style.
