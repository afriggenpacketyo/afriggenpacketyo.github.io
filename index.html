          <p>Nvidia announced first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, propelled by a substantial 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business. The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the upcoming quarter, slightly below estimates due to export restrictions on China-bound H20 chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. companies because of these restrictions, impacting their Hopper data center business in the region. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's overall growth remains strong, fueled by the increasing demand for AI chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. (not investment advice)</p>

The case began when Petrova, returning from France, carried frog embryo samples for her supervisor, leading to her visa cancellation and detention.

          <p>The Pentagon has discontinued the requirement for civilian employees to submit weekly emails outlining five accomplishments, an initiative partly influenced by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Employees were instructed to send a final email suggesting potential cost-cutting measures within the Pentagon. The initiative was implemented to provide leaders with insights into employee contributions and identify opportunities for improved efficiency. This change aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to reduce the size of the federal civilian workforce, potentially leading to the departure of over 50,000 Defense Department employees.</p>

He cited the EU's willingness to meet after the U.S. threatened a 50% tariff, which was later delayed, as evidence of the strategy's effectiveness.

          <p>Financial experts recommend that new college graduates prioritize saving for retirement to set themselves up for long-term financial stability, emphasizing the benefits of compound interest and early market entry. Investing in low-cost index funds and ETFs that track broad market indices is advised for diversification, with a focus on stocks for younger investors and a smaller allocation to bonds. While short-term market volatility may be concerning, time in the market is considered more important than timing the market. (not investment advice)</p>
