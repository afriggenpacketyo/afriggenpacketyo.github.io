        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article delves into the intricate process of how the Catholic Church selects a new Pope, addressing common questions about the conclave. It explains that the conclave's duration is indefinite, requiring a two-thirds majority for a decision, and cardinals are sequestered without outside communication. The article also touches on the various priorities different factions have for the next Pope, highlighting the diversity within the College of Cardinals and the impact of Pope Francis's reforms on Catholic politics. The piece concludes by outlining the eligibility criteria for cardinals and the reasons behind the age limit for voting. (The Pope's death is mentioned in this article, but the article is primarily about the process of electing a new Pope rather than the death itself).</p>

          <p>Google has signed an agreement with Elementl Power to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, aiming to meet the increasing energy demands of data centers, according to this CNBC article. Google will provide early-stage development capital, with each site expected to generate at least 600 megawatts. The company will have the option to purchase the power once the sites are operational, with the funding allocated for site permitting, interconnection rights, and contract negotiations. Elementl Power, founded in 2022, is technology-agnostic and plans to choose the most advanced reactor technology when construction begins, targeting 10 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035. This move aligns with Google's commitment to strengthening power grids and leveraging advanced nuclear technology for reliable energy.</p>

          <p>During a traffic stop in central Ohio, a police officer discovered a pet raccoon named "Chewy" with a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth, according to this CBS News article. The raccoon was found sitting in the driver's seat of the vehicle, prompting a more thorough search. Officers subsequently found methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and additional drug paraphernalia inside the car. The vehicle was pulled over due to the registered owner having an active warrant and a suspended driver's license, leading to the arrest of 55-year-old Victoria Vidal on drug possession charges. The raccoon was unharmed, and police confirmed Vidal possessed the necessary permits to legally own the animal.</p>

          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi defended the company's decision to increase in-office requirements and change employee benefits, according to this CNBC article. Employees will now be required to work in the office three days a week, and eligibility for the month-long paid sabbatical benefit has been raised from five to eight years of service. Khosrowshahi stated that the changes are aimed at improving collaboration, innovation, and company culture, even if they are unpopular with some employees. He emphasized the need for Uber to be at its best and denied that the changes were related to cost-cutting or attrition.</p>

          <p>Tesla's Shanghai factory experienced a significant drop in deliveries in April, reversing a previous rebound, according to this South China Morning Post article. Deliveries of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles decreased by 25.8% from March and 6% year-over-year. Fierce competition from Chinese rivals, aggressive pricing strategies, and new models have contributed to the decline. The Gigafactory's first-quarter deliveries were the lowest in three years, slumping 22% from the same period in 2024. The report indicates Tesla is facing challenges in maintaining its market share in China's competitive electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>A half-ton Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos 482, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere after being adrift for 53 years, according to this CBS News article. The spacecraft, launched in 1972, never made it out of Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. Experts are uncertain where it will land or how much of it will survive reentry. The spacecraft could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude. While the risk of it hitting someone or something is small, it cannot be completely excluded.</p>
