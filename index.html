        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched an anti-dumping investigation into pea starch imported from Canada. The move is seen as a retaliatory measure against Canadian tariffs on Chinese steel and follows complaints from domestic producers about low-priced Canadian imports causing financial losses. This action is part of a broader series of trade tensions, with China also imposing measures on Canadian canola oil and rubber imports. The probe will adhere to WTO rules, according to the ministry, despite being a response to what it calls Canada's discriminatory actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article challenges the romanticized view of the 1990s, arguing that data shows significant improvements in the present day. Citing "nostalgia bias," the author points to several key areas where modern life is demonstrably better, including drastically lower violent crime rates and a significant reduction in global extreme poverty. The piece also highlights major public health advancements, such as the successful fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and increased social tolerance and educational attainment. It concludes that while the 1990s had positive aspects, objective measures indicate substantial progress since then.</p>

          <p>The UK's Online Safety Act is facing significant backlash from users, tech companies, and U.S. politicians due to its new age verification requirements for adult websites and other major platforms. Intended to protect children from harmful content, the measures have forced sites like PornHub, Reddit, and X to implement systems requiring personal data, sparking privacy concerns and a surge in VPN usage. The controversy has extended to platforms like Wikipedia, which may be subject to user verification rules. The law's broad impact has drawn criticism for potentially chilling free expression and creating a complex regulatory environment.</p>

          <p>Swiss sportswear company On reported a 32% increase in second-quarter sales, surpassing Wall Street expectations and prompting the company to raise its full-year revenue guidance. This growth comes despite new tariffs on goods from Vietnam, where On sources about 90% of its products, which it has offset with price increases that have not dampened consumer demand. The sneaker brand, which has been gaining market share from competitors like Nike, saw strong performance across all regions, particularly in the Americas and China. The company's success is attributed to its premium positioning and a balanced direct-to-consumer and wholesale strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>School records released after a lengthy legal battle reveal the academic and behavioral decline of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The files show he began as a motivated student in kindergarten but faced numerous suspensions for bullying and harassment in middle school, eventually withdrawing from high school due to poor performance and attendance months before the attack. These documents are part of a larger release of thousands of pages, though they offer few new revelations about the widely criticized police response.

This event follows a serious single-vehicle crash three years ago where Garrett was also speeding, resulting in hospitalization and injuries. The 2023 Defensive Player of the Year received a $250 ticket for the latest infraction. The Cleveland Browns have not yet commented on the matter as they prepare for upcoming joint practices.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% jump in second-quarter revenue to $658.1 million in its first earnings report as a public company. This growth was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which reached $61.3 billion. Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue performance and positive guidance caused the company's shares to rise. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the success to growing interest from major financial institutions following the passage of supportive crypto legislation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article expresses alarm over the fifth consecutive year of declining kindergarten vaccination rates in the U.S., which coincides with a record high in vaccine exemptions. The author links this trend to the current administration's actions, such as appointing vaccine skeptics to key health positions and cutting funding for vaccine research and international public health programs like USAID. The piece argues these policies are fueling the largest U.S. measles outbreak in three decades and eroding public trust in medical science. It calls for a return to robust, locally-led public health initiatives to counter the dangerous trend.</p>

Shipping data shows a significant drop in China-U.S. cargo volumes, with the Shanghai Containerised Freight Index falling for nine consecutive weeks. However, this contraction in North American imports has been offset by strong growth in trade with Europe, Latin America, and other regions as China diversifies its trade partnerships.

While Meituan remains dominant in food delivery, analysts predict that the broader instant commerce market is evolving into a "near-duopoly."

          <p>Spirit Airlines has raised significant doubts about its ability to continue operations, warning it may not survive without securing additional cash. Five months after emerging from bankruptcy, the budget airline continues to face adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and a challenging pricing environment. The company stated in a quarterly report that its financial results are not improving quickly enough to meet creditor agreements, which could lead to defaults. Spirit is now exploring options like selling aircraft and other assets to raise the necessary liquidity to remain a going concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence has become a widely used tool among K-12 educators, who are leveraging it to save time on administrative work like creating lesson plans, grading rubrics, and writing report card comments. Specialized platforms like MagicSchool AI are now used by millions of teachers, and some large school districts are officially rolling out chatbots for classroom use. However, this adoption is happening alongside concerns about students using AI to cheat and the potential for AI-generated errors in curriculum materials. The rapid integration of AI presents a complex challenge for schools, balancing efficiency gains with pedagogical integrity.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Vladimir Putin is not preparing for peace but is instead readying new offensive operations. This warning comes as Russian forces reportedly achieved a significant breakthrough on the eastern front near Pokrovsk, and just days before a planned U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska to discuss the war. Zelenskyy asserted that intelligence shows Russian troop redeployments are inconsistent with peace preparations and that Putin aims to use the meeting as a personal victory. Ukrainian officials are not expected to attend the summit, which President Trump has described as a "feel out meeting."</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a massive, 1,550-mile-long ecosystem in the hadal zone, the deepest part of the ocean between Russia and Alaska. This community of life, including new species of clams and tube worms, thrives in total darkness through chemosynthesis, using methane seeping from the seafloor as its energy source instead of sunlight. The discovery suggests that such ecosystems may be common in other deep-sea trenches and that these areas play a larger role in the global carbon cycle than previously understood. The finding highlights how much of the deep ocean remains unexplored and the unique ways life can adapt to extreme environments.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant legal victory as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that his lawsuit against the NFL can proceed in civil court. The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's attempt to move the case to arbitration, a process where the league commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote before he was a coach to destroy his career. This ruling allows his case for damages and accountability to be heard by a public jury.</p>

His mother stated that her son was named throughout the trial and his killer should be as well, arguing Harvey's name was "tarnished" and he couldn't speak for himself. The family is also advocating for knife arches in schools to prevent similar tragedies, a plea they have discussed with the Home Secretary.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is currently moving westward, with early models projecting it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its formation marks an increase in activity during the peak months of the hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-normal season for 2025.</p>

          <p>Experts believe lung cancer is a grossly undercounted "hidden epidemic" across sub-Saharan Africa, with official statistics masking the true scale of the problem. While it is the world's deadliest cancer, it often goes undiagnosed in the region, frequently misidentified as tuberculosis due to similar symptoms and a high TB burden. A lack of diagnostic resources, limited health care infrastructure, and poor death registration systems contribute to the underreporting. As smoking rates rise, targeted by tobacco companies, health advocates warn the crisis will worsen without better data, prevention campaigns, and screening capabilities.</p>

          <p>This article explores several of Germany's unusual laws that can surprise visitors and residents alike, reflecting a culture that is both laissez-faire in some areas and highly regulated in others. Among the quirky rules is the "Tanzverbot" or dancing ban on Good Friday, a "silent holiday" where many noisy activities are forbidden. Other strange regulations include prohibitions on building large sandcastles on certain beaches to prevent erosion, a strict ban on mowing lawns on Sundays to preserve "Ruhezeit" or quiet time, and it being illegal to run out of fuel on the Autobahn.</p>
