            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been found guilty in her federal bribery trial, mirroring her husband's previous conviction on similar charges. Prosecutors successfully argued that the couple acted as "partners in crime," accepting cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for political favors. The defense contended there was no concrete evidence of Nadine's involvement in her husband's illicit activities. She faces sentencing in June, coinciding with her husband's scheduled prison reporting date for his 11-year sentence, having pleaded not guilty to 15 charges, some carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years.</p>

            <p>The United Nations has issued a warning about the global expansion of cyber scam operations, which are run by crime syndicates primarily based in Asia. These scams, which involve investment, romance, and cryptocurrency fraud, have generated billions of dollars in illicit revenue. While initially concentrated in Southeast Asia, these networks are now spreading to Africa, Europe, South America, and the Pacific islands. The UN is urging international cooperation to combat these sophisticated criminal enterprises, which often rely on trafficked workers forced to perpetrate online scams.</p>

            <p>Google is contending that the Justice Department's proposal to break up the company would hinder U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global race with China, particularly in artificial intelligence. The DOJ is seeking to force Google to divest its Chrome browser unit and open its search data to rivals following a ruling that Google holds a monopoly in internet search. Google argues that such measures would impede its ability to develop AI and would subject its product development to government regulation, ultimately disadvantaging the U.S. in the tech industry.</p>
