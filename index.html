          <p>Following her acquittal on murder charges, Karen Read has secured a book deal and a potential TV series, while her case continues to create turmoil. Witnesses in the trial report facing an ongoing campaign of harassment from Read's supporters, and the family of the victim, John O'Keefe, is dealing with the verdict's emotional toll. The case has also led to professional consequences for law enforcement involved, including the firing of one state police detective and the reassignment of another, highlighting the deep and lasting impact of the high-profile trial on the community.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Dam on Tibetan Plateau May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's construction of a major dam in Tibet might not lead to the water crisis in India that many had feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that water flow during the dry season has actually increased downstream. Specifically, low flows in February saw a more than 50 percent rise, suggesting the dam's water regulation could alleviate drought conditions rather than exacerbate them, countering previous concerns about water scarcity.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers has toured the newly established "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades, following weeks of requests and a lawsuit by Democrats. Detainees have alleged inhumane conditions, including extreme heat, insufficient food, and lack of medical care, claims which state officials dispute. Democratic lawmakers described the conditions as "appalling," noting high temperatures and limited water access, while Republican counterparts found the facility satisfactory. The visit has intensified calls for further investigation and hearings into the controversial center's operations and purpose.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 30% tariff on goods imported from both the European Union and Mexico, set to take effect on August 1. The move stems from stalled trade negotiations and is justified by the administration as a necessary step to address persistent trade deficits. The EU has expressed strong disapproval and threatened proportionate countermeasures, while Mexico's president stated a desire to negotiate a better outcome. This action marks a significant escalation in trade tensions with key U.S. partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's struggling steel industry, centered in towns like Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, is facing renewed pressure from the threat of U.S. tariffs and ongoing domestic issues. While the UK was exempted from a recent tariff hike, the persistence of a 25% tariff on steel exports to the U.S. is costing orders and creating anxiety. This comes as the industry grapples with high energy prices and the closure of blast furnaces, such as those at Tata Steel in Port Talbot. The situation leaves steel-reliant communities in a precarious position, wrestling with their industrial identity and an uncertain economic future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vast Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a critical source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. Thousands of miners work daily under the supervision of the rebel group, which claims to have brought security to the area, though a UN report alleges the M23 profits heavily from taxing the mineral. The visit comes shortly after a ceasefire deal was signed between DR Congo and Rwanda, with the U.S. reportedly seeking mineral rights in the region. The situation highlights the complex interplay of conflict, resources, and international interests in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival in viewership, with its social media engagement, particularly on TikTok, growing even faster than its television audience. The show's official accounts have gained over a million followers on TikTok this year, where short clips, recaps, and fan analyses allow viewers to keep up with the drama without watching the full nightly episodes. While this strategy is attracting a new and wider audience, some observers and former contestants worry that consuming the show through bite-sized, out-of-context clips may distort the reality of the events and contestants.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas over the Fourth of July weekend have resulted in at least 129 deaths, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The victims include numerous children and counselors from Camp Mystic, a summer camp that was directly in the path of the deluge. The disaster was caused by a massive weather system that dropped extreme rainfall on the flood-prone region. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alert before the "wall of death" struck.</p>

          <p>Investigators have begun a multi-year excavation at the former site of the St Mary's children's home in Tuam, Ireland, to exhume the remains of hundreds of babies and toddlers believed to be buried in a mass grave. The institution, run by nuns from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children, and death records show nearly 800 children died there. The horrific discovery was brought to light by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, whose research indicated the children were buried in an unmarked site, possibly a disused sewage tank, leading to a government investigation and this formal excavation.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from making "indiscriminate" arrests of individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. The ruling, part of an ongoing lawsuit, states that there is a "mountain of evidence" that officials have been unconstitutionally rounding up people without reasonable suspicion. The order specifically bars arrests based solely on race, ethnicity, or presence at certain locations and also ensures access to legal counsel for those detained. This decision comes amid heightened immigration enforcement and protests in the region.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, setting the tone for the Los Angeles Dodgers to end their seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. In his longest outing since returning to the mound after surgery, Ohtani pitched three scoreless innings, striking out four and allowing only one hit. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed. The outing is another positive step in his gradual buildup as a starting pitcher.</p>
