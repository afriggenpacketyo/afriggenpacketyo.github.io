          <p>The U.S. military has announced that its ongoing air campaign, Operation Rough Rider, has hit over 800 targets in Yemen in the past six weeks, targeting Houthi militia infrastructure. The strikes focused on command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, weapons manufacturing, and storage locations, including those for anti-ship missiles and drones. Congressional officials estimate the campaign has cost over $1 billion, raising concerns about the rapid use of munitions. The U.S. Central Command issued the announcement detailing the operation's scope and targets, highlighting the military's efforts in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A 14-year-old girl has been sentenced to 15 years in detention after being found guilty of attempting to murder two teachers and a pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Carmarthenshire. The teenager, who brought a weapon to school every day, used her father's multi-tool knife in the attack, during which she repeatedly said "I'm going to kill you". The victims, Fiona Elias, Liz Hopkin, and a 14-year-old pupil, sustained stab wounds and were treated in hospital. The teachers addressed the teenager in court, with one stating "you are not a murderer" and another saying she will campaign for teachers' safety. </p>

          <p>Ukraine is increasingly relying on its domestic drone program, called the Line of Drones, as it faces uncertainty over continued military support from the United States and potential cease-fire talks with Russia. The initiative focuses on assembling unmanned systems within Ukraine, primarily small exploding drones operated from shelters. This program becomes crucial if cease-fire talks fail or if the U.S. reduces arms shipments. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day cease-fire in Ukraine next month, citing it as a gesture of goodwill.</p>

          <p>The UK government faces potential clashes with trade unions after review bodies recommended pay rises for teachers and NHS staff exceeding the budgeted amount. The government has ruled out extra cash for higher pay deals, suggesting cuts and efficiency savings would be needed. Teaching unions have threatened strikes if pay rises trigger cuts or layoffs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns of tough trade-offs, potentially leading to tax rises or spending cuts in other areas. Public anger over pay and squeezed public services could impact local elections.</p>

          <p>A BBC-commissioned report has revealed that a small number of BBC stars and managers exhibit unacceptable behavior at work, and that bosses often fail to address it. The review, triggered by the Huw Edwards scandal, concluded that while a widespread "toxic" culture does not exist, there is a minority whose bad behavior is not addressed. In response, the BBC will introduce reforms, including a more robust disciplinary policy and improved complaint mechanisms. BBC chairman Samir Shah emphasized that those who abuse power have no place at the corporation.</p>

Al Masirah, the Houthi-run TV channel, reported that at least 68 migrants were killed and 47 injured when the center in Saada province was bombed. The US military has not commented directly, but U.S. Central Command announced it had hit over 800 targets since intensifying its air campaign. Despite the ongoing conflict, migrants continue to arrive in Yemen, seeking passage to Saudi Arabia for work, often facing exploitation and dangerous conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a broken mental health system, individuals accused of crimes are often held in jail cells due to a lack of adequate mental health services, particularly crisis care. Lake County, Montana, is an example of this issue, where individuals in mental health crises are confined in small isolation cells while awaiting an open bed at the Montana State Hospital. This situation is not unique to Montana, as nearly half of the people locked in local jails in the U.S. have a mental illness. State officials acknowledge the problem but cite constraints like money and staffing shortages, leading to calls for increased funding and community-based services.</p>

          <p>An op-ed discusses the increasing accessibility of private equity (PE) to retail investors due to regulatory changes, raising concerns about their preparedness for the complexities and risks involved. Retail investors may be seen as a source of capital for PE firms, potentially receiving less desirable opportunities compared to institutional players. The lack of transparency and illiquidity in private equity investments can pose significant challenges for retail investors, who may not fully understand the higher fees, longer lock-up periods, and limited liquidity. The author advises caution and suggests that private equity may not be suitable for every retail investor's profile or objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

She was finally lured into a crate using a shirt worn by her owner. Valerie has been safely rescued and is being returned to her owners.</p>
