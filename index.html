The moment was met with a standing ovation and widespread support from fans, some of whom attended specifically for the historic occasion. Players and managers also praised her achievement, highlighting the dedication required to reach the major leagues after a decade in the minors.

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by initiating a review of its federally funded research and threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching legal requirements tied to federal funding and has started a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to seize the patents. This action follows previous administration moves to freeze federal research money over Harvard's handling of campus protests related to the Gaza conflict. Critics view the administration's actions as a politically motivated attack on academic freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise health benefits like stress reduction and calmness is facing scrutiny from experts. Nutritionists and dietitians express skepticism, noting that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane, L-theanine, and Ashwagandha in these drinks are unlikely to have a significant physiological effect. One brand, Trip, had an advertisement banned for making unproven health claims. While some consumers find the drinks to be a helpful alternative to alcohol for unwinding, psychologists suggest the perceived calming effect may be more psychological, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors, from President Emmanuel Macron. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure on the Left Bank, selling papers like Le Monde. He reflects on the decline of his trade from a bustling enterprise to a solitary pursuit in the digital age, but he continues his work for the joy and independence it brings. Akbar is a cherished part of the Saint-Germain neighborhood's fabric, having witnessed its cultural shifts over the decades.</p>

          <p>The village of Pampa Clemesí in Peru exists in a state of paradox, lacking electricity while situated next to the country's largest solar complex. For years, its 150 residents have lived without a connection to the national power grid, relying on torches or small, often incomplete, personal solar setups. The solar plant, Rubí, generates enough power for over 350,000 homes, yet the villagers struggle daily for basic needs like refrigeration and light. While the plant's operator and the government have completed parts of an electrification project, bureaucratic delays have left the final connection to homes in limbo, trapping the community in a long and frustrating wait.</p>

Organizers emphasize that the contest demonstrates that a dog's pedigree does not define its value. Many of the participating dogs, including Petunia, are rescues from shelters and puppy mills, highlighting the positive aspects of animal adoption. Petunia and her owner received a $5,000 prize for their victory in the pageant.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Qatar's prime minister in Spain to advance a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The framework reportedly involves the simultaneous release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a complete Israeli military withdrawal from the territory. The meeting comes as Israel's plan to take over Gaza City faces strong international condemnation from numerous countries, including key European allies and Arab nations. Meanwhile, families of the hostages are increasing pressure on the Israeli government, fearing the planned offensive will endanger the lives of those still in captivity.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal made without Ukraine's involvement would be a "dead decision." He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not concede land to the occupier. The planned bilateral meeting in Alaska has sparked anxiety in Kyiv and among European leaders, who issued a joint statement affirming that Ukraine's destiny cannot be decided without its participation. The White House has indicated a trilateral meeting with Zelenskyy is possible, but the current format remains bilateral.</p>

          <p>A man in Leicestershire was wrongly issued a £165 parking charge after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. Richard Lynn had paid for 30 minutes of parking, but the system logged his Hyundai entering and a Kia with a nearly identical plate leaving nine hours later. Despite the clear error, he received a threatening letter from solicitors demanding payment. The parking company, Horizon Parking, stated the issue was rectified after being contacted, but Mr. Lynn had not received confirmation. The incident raises concerns about the accuracy of automated enforcement and the aggressive tactics used for debt recovery.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a debate about the nature of identity in the modern era. While Sheeran faced some social media criticism, his claim—based on his Irish heritage, passport, and formative experiences—highlights the complex, multi-layered identities many people hold. The article explores how "Irishness" is no longer a simple binary, particularly in the post-Good Friday Agreement era, and encompasses a wide spectrum of cultural expressions. Experts and commentators note that identity is a personal, evolving concept that transcends rigid definitions of nationality or birthplace.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger is investigating how the largest Martian meteorite ever found on Earth was exported and sold at a Sotheby's auction in New York for $4.3 million. The 24.7kg rock was reportedly discovered in the Sahara Desert in Niger in 2023 by a meteorite hunter and sold to an international dealer. While Sotheby's maintains that all relevant export procedures were followed, Nigerien officials and heritage advocates have expressed doubts about the legality of its removal, raising concerns about illicit trafficking of natural heritage.

          <p>The release of a new "War of the Worlds" adaptation, which has been widely panned by critics, has sparked a conversation about why some audiences are drawn to "bad" movies. Films that receive exceptionally low scores on review sites can generate intrigue, with viewers curious to experience what makes them uniquely terrible. Experts and film enthusiasts suggest that earnestly made but flawed films are often more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. The appeal lies in their unintentional humor, visible production struggles, and a certain charm that polished films lack, turning them into cult classics that are "so bad they're good."</p>

Despite ongoing security concerns about its Chinese origins, some US startups continue to use DeepSeek to cut costs.

          <p>In recent comments, financial commentator Jim Cramer shared a positive outlook on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), highlighting the strong performance of its core businesses. He noted that Google Search and YouTube are doing "amazingly well" and that the Gemini AI platform has complemented, rather than cannibalized, the search business. Cramer also praised the company's autonomous vehicle division, Waymo, stating that it is "building a nice lead" in the self-driving space and is a valuable asset. He identified Alphabet, along with Microsoft and Meta, as major buyers of NVIDIA chips, positioning them as winners in the AI-driven market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats are intensifying their opposition to the Republican-backed tax bill, with Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego holding a well-attended town hall in Iowa to assail the legislation. Gallego described the bill as likely to make "America poorer and sicker," a message that resonated with the supportive crowd. The event is part of a broader Democratic strategy to go on the offensive, using the bill's perceived liabilities, particularly its cuts to Medicaid, as a key issue for the upcoming midterm elections. The unified and energized opposition marks a clarifying moment for the party as it seeks to rally its base against the Trump administration's signature legislative achievement.</p>

          <p>The Chief Financial Officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned from her $210,000-a-year position after officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as a full-time town administrator in Greybull, Wyoming. Dawn Norton had been working remotely for Wilton while on family medical leave before taking the Wyoming job. While Norton claims she kept Wilton's leadership informed and had submitted her retirement notice, town officials state they were unaware she held another full-time public office, which would have violated employment terms. The discovery came amid a review of Wilton's finance department, which was already under scrutiny for issues like understaffing and audit findings of "material weakness."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals upon receiving a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away and barred from re-entering the UK, with their destination countries deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this would save taxpayers money and protect the public, as foreign nationals constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics, including the shadow justice secretary, have raised concerns that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals, potentially rendering the plan unworkable.</p>

          <h2>Neurologist Highlights Pomegranates as a Key Fruit for Brain Health in People Over 50</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neurologist is recommending that people over 50 consider adding pomegranates to their diet to support healthy brain aging. According to Dr. Mill Etienne, pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. These neuroprotective effects may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein buildup associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fresh fruit can be costly and seasonal, pomegranate extract is an alternative, though consumers should choose versions without added sugars. The article advises consulting a doctor before regular consumption, as pomegranates can interact with certain medications.</p>

          <p>London police arrested 474 people at a protest in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. The demonstration was an act of civil disobedience, with hundreds of participants intentionally displaying signs supporting the group to challenge the ban. The government proscribed the organization in July, making public support a criminal offense, following an incident where activists vandalized military aircraft. While the Home Secretary defended the ban based on security advice, Amnesty International criticized the mass arrests as disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

The win extends England's winning streak against France to 16 consecutive matches and serves as a major confidence boost for the world's number one ranked team. While not a flawless performance, the comprehensive victory in a hostile away environment demonstrates why England are strong favorites to win the upcoming tournament.</p>

Cape buffalo are known to be one of the most dangerous animals to hunt in Africa. The incident has sparked online debate, with animal rights groups and activists using the hunter's death to condemn the practice of trophy hunting, arguing that animals are not trophies or decorations.</p>

          <p>The abrupt removal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long after just two months was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over using confidential tax data to locate undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security had requested the IRS cross-check a list of 40,000 names, but the agency declined to hand over verified information, citing taxpayer privacy laws. The incident highlights the Trump administration's pressure on federal agencies to assist in its immigration crackdown. Long's dismissal makes him the shortest-serving confirmed IRS commissioner in the agency's history; he has since been named the new U.S. ambassador to Iceland.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Jonny Bairstow's spectacular unbeaten 86 from 50 balls was not enough to save Welsh Fire from an eight-run defeat to London Spirit.

He nearly pulled off a miracle with a stunning late acceleration, including back-to-back sixes, but Spirit's bowlers held on in a tense final set. London Spirit's total of 163-5 was anchored by an unbeaten 70 from Australian opener David Warner. The loss means both the men's and women's Welsh Fire teams remain winless in the tournament.</p>
