          <p>President Vladimir Putin has declared a three-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine, scheduled for May 8-10, coinciding with Russia's World War II Victory Day. Ukraine has accused Putin's forces of violating previous ceasefire agreements. This decision comes amidst increasing pressure from the Trump administration for both Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate an end to the conflict, with threats of sanctions looming if no progress is made. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has stated the Kremlin is ready to reach a deal with the U.S., though details remain unclear. </p>

          <p>Tencent and Alibaba have reportedly purchased a substantial number of Nvidia GPUs from ByteDance to support their artificial intelligence development efforts. ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, had previously stockpiled a large quantity of chips. The purchases reflect the surging demand for computing power driven by AI adoption and tighter U.S. export restrictions, which have made it more difficult for Chinese companies to access advanced semiconductor technologies. Nvidia's H20 chip, while less powerful than its top-tier offerings, remains a key component for AI development in China.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese economic official asserted that China's food and energy security would not be compromised even if it halted purchases from the United States. China has diversified its food and energy imports in recent years to reduce its dependence on the US. The official stated that imports of sorghum, corn, and soybeans from the US only account for a small share of China's total grain consumption and are highly replaceable. This statement comes as trade tensions between the two countries intensify.</p>
