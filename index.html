          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," characterized by inflated valuations and widespread investor excitement where both good and bad ideas receive funding. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, he compared the situation to past bubbles like the dot-com crash but emphasized that the underlying AI technology is real and transformative. Bezos argued that such bubbles can have positive long-term outcomes, citing the biotech boom of the 1990s which led to life-saving drugs despite many company failures, and predicted AI will ultimately change every industry for the better.

          <p>England's women's cricket team began their World Cup campaign with a decisive 10-wicket victory over South Africa in Guwahati, bowling out their opponents for a mere 69 runs. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith was the standout performer, taking three key wickets for only seven runs, as the South African batting lineup collapsed in just over 20 overs. England's captain Nat Sciver-Brunt also contributed with two wickets in her return to bowling after injury. The dominant performance provides England with a significant net run-rate advantage, placing them in a strong position early in the tournament.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has stated he has "no problem" with Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, or Jack Grealish, despite their notable exclusion from the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia. Tuchel explained the decision was made to maintain consistency with the group that achieved a strong 5-0 victory over Serbia in the previous camp, emphasizing team spirit. While acknowledging the players' high caliber and form, particularly Bellingham's desire to be included after returning from injury, the manager stressed that no player is guaranteed a spot. The only change to the squad was Bukayo Saka replacing the injured Noni Madueke.</p>

          <p>Flights at Munich airport were temporarily suspended overnight after sightings of unidentified drones, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers. This incident coincided with Belgian defense officials investigating multiple drone sightings over the Elsenborn military base near the German border. The events are the latest in a series of unexplained drone activities near critical infrastructure in Western Europe, raising suspicions of Russian involvement to probe NATO's security posture. European leaders have recently discussed boosting air defenses in response to these incursions and other Russian airspace violations, highlighting growing regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A major fire broke out at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo, Los Angeles County, after an explosion was reported on Thursday night. Fire crews responded quickly and contained the blaze to a specific area within the facility, which is the largest oil refinery on the West Coast. Officials reported no injuries and stated that evacuation orders were not necessary, though residents were advised to stay indoors due to potential air quality impacts. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is monitoring for toxins, and operations at the nearby Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) were not affected by the incident.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago Transit Authority projects, the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the hold, claiming it was to ensure the funds are not used for race-based contracting, a justification also used for freezing funds for projects in New York. This move is the latest in a series of actions during the government shutdown targeting funding for Democratic-led cities and states. Critics view these actions as politically motivated tactics by the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

While all wealth groups experienced gains, the growth was most rapid at the top, with the wealthiest 0.1% seeing their wealth nearly double since the pandemic.

It highlights the role of "sonideros," or DJs, who popularized a slowed-down version of the music called "cumbia rebajada," which gave rise to the "cholombiano" subculture. The piece documents how this music scene persisted through periods of intense cartel violence, moving from street parties to indoor gatherings for safety. Now, with violence receding, cumbia is returning to the streets as a new generation seeks to reclaim and celebrate this distinct cultural identity.</p>

Supporters of the death penalty cite public opinion and its role in delivering justice, while opponents argue it violates human rights and risks executing the innocent.

Chief Constable Stephen Watson stated the injury may have been a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of the necessary police action to stop the vehicle and stabbing attack.

          <p>A new report from the EAT-Lancet Commission states that even with a full transition away from fossil fuels, emissions from the global food system will push temperatures past the 1.5°C climate threshold. The report emphasizes that the most effective way to mitigate this is for people in wealthier countries to adopt more plant-based diets and consume less meat and dairy. This dietary shift, combined with reducing food waste and improving agricultural practices, could cut food system emissions by over half. The commission's findings face an aggressive counter-narrative from the meat industry, which has actively worked to downplay its environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Celeste Rivas Hernandez, the 14-year-old girl whose body was discovered in the trunk of a Tesla owned by singer D4vd, had been reported missing multiple times in the months leading up to her death. The teenager from Lake Elsinore, California, had a history of running away, causing distress for her family and community. Her decomposing body was found in early September in the Hollywood Hills, and authorities believe she may have been dead for weeks. Police are now investigating the connection between Hernandez and 20-year-old D4vd, whose real name is David Burke, reviewing media that appears to show them together.</p>

          <p>Vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes are protected from recent U.S. tariff rollbacks due to a Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment, which prevents the regulation of "informational materials." This exemption is a significant relief for the booming vinyl market, which now accounts for nearly three-quarters of all physical music revenue in the U.S. The continued growth, driven largely by artists like Taylor Swift and Gen Z consumers, has been a boon for record labels. While some U.S. manufacturers argue that tariffs would support domestic jobs, the exemption currently keeps prices lower for consumers.</p>

The number of people receiving emergency aid will be drastically reduced from 1.1 million to just 350,000 by November. This cut comes as Somalia faces a severe hunger crisis, with 4.6 million people experiencing crisis-level food insecurity amid conflict, instability, and the devastating impacts of climate change.

          <p>A growing body of data indicates that young college graduates are struggling to secure their first full-time jobs in a weakening labor market, with the unemployment rate for "new entrants" reaching a nine-year high. Research from the Burning Glass Institute suggests that for the first time in modern history, a bachelor's degree is not reliably providing access to white-collar professions. This trend is attributed to a "low-firing, low-hiring environment," an oversupply of graduates, and concerns about AI automating entry-level roles. The difficulty in launching a career is causing significant stress for many young adults. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by DW and De Groene Amsterdammer indicates that Volkswagen's electric vehicles likely contain "conflict minerals" sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Based on VW's own raw materials report, the investigation identified at least six smelters in its supply chain that have been linked to the violent conflict in the DRC. These minerals, including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG), are essential for EV manufacturing but their trade often funds armed groups. While Volkswagen did not confirm or deny the links, citing supply chain complexity, the findings raise serious questions about industry due diligence.</p>

Ramsey calculated that by consistently investing from age 51 to 70, she could retire with between $600,000 and $800,000.
