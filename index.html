          <p>This article recounts the experiences of children rescued from the Aum Shinrikyo cult compound after the 1995 Tokyo subway nerve gas attack, detailing the abuse and indoctrination they suffered. Mitsuo Hosaka, a child welfare worker, describes the challenges of providing a safe space for the 53 children, who initially displayed hostility and a lack of emotional connection due to brainwashing. Over time, the children began to heal, engaging in play and forming relationships with the staff, eventually reintegrating into society. The article highlights the importance of severing the parent-child relationship in the cult's teachings and the long-term impact on the children's development.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio from President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has surfaced, raising concerns about his cognitive abilities. The audio reveals Biden struggling to recall the year of his son Beau's death and the year Donald Trump was elected president, requiring staff to correct him. This reinforces Hur's conclusion that Biden's memory was "significantly limited," leading him to describe the president as a "well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory." The White House had previously kept the audio under wraps, and the release has sparked criticism and renewed debate about Biden's fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner stated that voters wanted less state intervention and more freedom, but the new government is delivering more state control and debt. Lindner's comments followed the FDP's poor performance in the national election, which left them without a seat in the Bundestag. Christian Dürr was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman, receiving 82% of the vote.</p>

General Manager Will Kuntz stated that the decision to extend Vanney's contract was not influenced by the team's current results, as discussions began after their championship win in December.
