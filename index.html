          <p>Ukraine has lost an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, during a large-scale Russian missile and drone assault. The Ukrainian air force reported that Ustimenko shot down seven aerial targets before his aircraft was damaged, and he heroically steered the plane away from populated areas, leaving no time to eject. The attack was one of the largest of the war, prompting President Zelenskyy to call for strengthened air defenses and honor the pilot's sacrifice. This event underscores the intense and dangerous nature of the air war over Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has stated that recent Israeli and US strikes caused severe but not total damage to Iran's nuclear facilities. He warned that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential bomb within a matter of months. This assessment contradicts claims that the program was completely destroyed and suggests that a long-term diplomatic solution remains critical.

          <p>After a six-year wait for justice, a California jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for killing his former classmate, Blaze Bernstein.

The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an act of rage, not a premeditated hate crime, an argument the jury ultimately rejected.

The French state led a â‚¬1.35 billion investment, becoming the company's largest shareholder in a bid to enhance Europe's technological sovereignty in space. However, industry experts express doubt about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near future, citing major disparities in scale, launch capabilities, and infrastructure. Eutelsat's current constellation of 650 satellites is vastly outnumbered by Starlink's network of over 7,000. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is a direct response to the perceived threat from Russia and aims to bolster their border defenses. The plan involves producing and storing mines that can be deployed quickly in an emergency, creating what some describe as a new "Iron Curtain." This controversial decision reflects growing security concerns in the region, though it raises alarm among humanitarian groups due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued progress as a pitcher by throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career, a four-seam fastball that reached 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss. The appearance was Ohtani's third start since returning to the mound from elbow surgery.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new ban on smoking in many public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools and swimming pools, which went into effect on Sunday. The rules are part of a national plan to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aim to protect children from secondhand smoke. Violators could face fines up to â‚¬700, though there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, but it marks a significant public health step in a country with a relatively high smoking rate.</p>

          <p>A detailed BBC report reveals the story of Jay Hulme, a church volunteer who was stalked by a Church of England lay preacher, Venessa Pinto, after he rejected her advances. When Hulme reported the campaign of harassment, the Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, initially dismissed his complaint and accused Hulme of witchcraft. The stalking continued for nearly two years before police took action, leading to Pinto's conviction. The case exposes significant failures in safeguarding and accountability within the Church, as the victim was disbelieved and punished while the perpetrator remained in her role.</p>

          <p>Chinese civil servants in some regions are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent, locally-imposed austerity measures that can be stricter than central government regulations. An official from Sichuan province noted that his department head had announced a ban on eating out, reflecting a trend of "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control. This shift in lifestyle, even if temporary, is a direct consequence of the evolving and often unpredictable anti-corruption and austerity campaigns within the country.
