          <p>Inflation in the euro zone held steady at 2% in July, a figure higher than the 1.9% economists had anticipated. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, also remained unchanged at 2.3%, suggesting persistent price pressures. This data makes it less likely that the European Central Bank will resume interest rate cuts in the near future, with markets overwhelmingly predicting rates will be held steady at the next meeting in September. The economic figures indicate some resilience in the face of U.S. tariff policies, though their full impact remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a novel anti-poaching effort, scientists in South Africa have begun injecting rhino horns with a harmless radioactive substance. The initiative, known as the Rhisotope Project by the University of the Witwatersrand, aims to make smuggled horns easily detectable by customs authorities worldwide. After a six-year pilot study involving 20 rhinos confirmed the material's safety for the animals, the project is now being deployed at a larger scale. This innovative method seeks to disrupt the illegal export of horns to Asian markets, where they are used in traditional medicine and valued as status symbols.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man is in custody after eight children attending a summer camp in Stathern Lodge, Leicestershire, were hospitalized for suspected poisoning. The children have since been discharged, but police have been granted more time to question the suspect. The incident prompted a large emergency response, with locals describing "crazy" and "stressed" scenes as parents gathered. Leicestershire Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct for its handling of the initial report of children feeling unwell a day before officers visited the camp.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, leaving only 250 to protect federal properties as anti-ICE protests have become less intense. The initial deployment of 4,000 troops in June to manage riots was contested by California state and local officials, who argued it was unnecessary and escalated tensions. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom praised the withdrawal, with Newsom stating President Trump's "political theater backfired." The troops had been primarily guarding federal ICE facilities amid demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies.</p>

The move follows months of negotiations, resulting in deals with partners like the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, which secured baseline tariffs of 15%. However, holdouts such as Switzerland, India, and Brazil face significantly higher duties, while Canada's tariff rate has been increased to 35% amid ongoing disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal prison in New Mexico, operated by private contractor CoreCivic, is under FBI investigation for a "drug trafficking epidemic" and high number of inmate deaths. An FBI affidavit reveals that some CoreCivic correctional officers are allegedly involved in smuggling drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine into the Cibola County Correctional Center. Despite these issues, CoreCivic has pitched the facility to ICE for expanded immigrant detention. The investigation highlights systemic problems, including a lucrative internal drug trade and at least 15 premature deaths at the facility since 2018.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine, potentially as early as September. This move reflects growing international frustration with the 22-month war in Gaza and would further isolate the U.S. and Israeli position. While France appears ready for unconditional recognition, the UK and Canada have tied their decisions to conditions such as a ceasefire and actions by the Palestinian Authority. Analysts suggest the move is largely symbolic but carries diplomatic weight, signaling a potential "dam breaking" moment for other nations to follow suit.</p>

The state's heavy reliance on declining oil revenue has created a long-foreseen budget crisis, yet officials have not agreed on alternative funding solutions like an income or sales tax. As a result, schools like one in Sleetmute face potential collapse, and new construction projects are stalled.</p>

          <p>British 800-meter runner Max Burgin is optimistic about his chances at the upcoming World Championships in Tokyo after a strong start to the season. The 23-year-old, who broke numerous records as a junior, recently ran the third-fastest time in British history, signaling a return to form after years plagued by injuries and bad luck. Burgin's career had previously stalled while his contemporary, Keely Hodgkinson, achieved global success, but he now feels he is back on the right trajectory. He must first secure his spot at this weekend's UK Athletics Championships in Birmingham.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's congress, controlled by President Nayib Bukele's Nuevas Ideas party, has approved constitutional reforms that permit indefinite presidential re-election. The changes, which also extend the presidential term from five to six years, remove a key democratic safeguard that had been in place since 1983. This move solidifies Bukele's power, following a controversial 2021 Supreme Court ruling that allowed him to run for his current second term despite a constitutional ban. Critics and civil society organizations have condemned the reforms as a consolidation of authoritarianism, placing El Salvador alongside Venezuela and Nicaragua in allowing unlimited terms.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court ruling could allow millions of motorists to claim compensation for being mis-sold car finance deals. The court is deciding whether to uphold a finding that hidden commission payments made by lenders to car dealers were unlawful. These "discretionary commission arrangements," where dealers were incentivized to secure higher interest rates, were banned in 2021, but the new ruling could apply more broadly. Lenders like Lloyds have set aside billions in anticipation of potential payouts, which could rival the scale of the past payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for the potential arrival of a named storm next week, as a low-pressure system is forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds. Current models show the system tracking across the northern UK on Monday, with potential wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph in some areas. The Met Office will only name the storm if it is expected to have a notable impact, but the conditions could cause travel disruption and power outages. The last named storm to hit the UK was Storm Éowyn in January, which caused widespread damage and power loss.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its microchips contain "back doors" that would allow for remote access or control. The statement came after China's cybersecurity regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), summoned the company for an interview regarding potential security risks in its H20 chips. These chips were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls for the Chinese market. The surprise regulatory scrutiny from Beijing highlights the immense challenge Nvidia faces in navigating the escalating U.S.-China tech rivalry while trying to maintain access to the critical Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has expressed shock at President Trump's recent comment that the disgraced financier had "stolen" her from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, the family said Giuffre was "preyed upon" at Trump's property, not stolen like an object, and called for answers about what the president knew. The comments have renewed focus on Trump's past relationship with Epstein. This development comes as Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was recently interviewed by the Justice Department while serving her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>A new UK law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed in 2022, has come into effect, banning the sale, possession, and importation of ninja swords. Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, campaigned relentlessly for the law after her son was killed in a case of mistaken identity by a teenager who had easily purchased the weapon online. The law, known as Ronan's Law, also requires retailers to report suspicious knife orders and perform strict age verification. A month-long surrender scheme ahead of the ban saw over 1,000 of the weapons removed from the streets.</p>
