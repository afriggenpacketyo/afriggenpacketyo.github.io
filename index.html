          <p>Ian Watkins, the former lead singer of the rock band Lostprophets, has died after being attacked in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses. West Yorkshire Police are investigating the incident, which occurred on a Saturday morning, resulting in Watkins being pronounced dead at the scene. He was convicted in 2013 for a series of heinous crimes, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. The attack highlights recent concerns about increased violence at the facility, as noted in a report by the chief inspector of prisons just weeks prior to the event.</p>

          <p>In Memphis, Tennessee, National Guard troops have commenced patrols, a move supported by the state's governor to address crime, while in Illinois, a different federal issue unfolds. U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth were barred from entering an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility near Chicago, raising concerns about transparency and conditions inside. The senators, citing their congressional oversight authority, criticized the lack of access as shameful and suggested something was being hidden. This occurs as federal courts have blocked the administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops in other cities like Chicago and Portland against the will of local leaders.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London last year, has been honorably retired. The 15-year-old horse sustained significant injuries, including a broken bone, after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise in April 2024. The incident saw the horses collide with vehicles and caused injuries to five soldiers and four civilians. Due to the severity of his injuries, Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. He will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, a peaceful retirement destination for service animals.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that there are no survivors among the workers present during a massive explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems plant in Humphreys County, Tennessee. The Friday morning blast completely destroyed the building, and after an extensive search by over 300 first responders, the mission has shifted from rescue to recovery. Officials stated that while they were previously searching for 18 unaccounted individuals, they now presume all are deceased and are working to identify remains.

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has forced the closure of all 21 Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, beginning Sunday. The federal institution, which relies on the government for over 60% of its funding, exhausted its prior-year funds that had kept it open for the first 11 days of the shutdown. Officials have assured the public that all animals at the zoo will continue to receive excellent care from essential staff, although popular nonessential features like the animal webcams will be turned off. This development marks another significant public impact of the funding dispute in Congress, following the closure of some national parks across the country.</p>

          <p>A day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect, tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched through central London, calling for a free Palestine and an end to UK arms sales to Israel. The demonstration, organized by the Palestine Coalition, moved from Victoria Embankment to a rally in Whitehall, with a small group of pro-Israel counter-protesters also present. Speakers at the rally described the U.S.-brokered ceasefire as a positive but fragile step, vowing to continue protesting until the conflict's root causes are addressed.

This move was framed as a response to China's own export controls on rare earth minerals.

The plan, endorsed at the party conference in Aberdeen, states that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election, it will consider it a mandate to negotiate for another vote. This approach prioritizes a recognized precedent over an alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum.

This trend involves cheap, mass-produced home goods designed for short-term use, contributing to millions of tons of waste annually as items are difficult to recycle. Instead, many are turning to secondhand marketplaces to find unique, durable pieces, driven by sustainability concerns, budget constraints, and a desire for items with history. This shift in consumer behavior is reflected in soaring online searches for used decor and is challenging the business model of retailers who promote rapidly changing seasonal trends.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress and the president fail to approve funding legislation, causing federal agencies to cease non-essential operations. Based on the Antideficiency Act of 1884, this mechanism has been triggered 21 times since 1976, forcing hundreds of thousands of federal employees into unpaid furloughs. While essential services like law enforcement and air traffic control continue, the shutdown impacts everything from national parks to administrative functions.

          <p>The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has made its first arrests under Florida's new "Halo Law," which creates a 25-foot buffer zone around law enforcement and first responders during official duties. Two women, Anita Gibson and Jasmine Jefferson, were arrested for allegedly violating the law by harassing and impeding an officer who was arresting a third woman, Erika McGriff. The initial incident with McGriff, who was charged with battery on an officer, escalated and drew a crowd. Sheriff T.K. Waters emphasized that while citizens can observe and record from beyond 25 feet, actions that create a safety risk for officers will lead to arrest under the new statute.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has started radiation therapy as part of his treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which was diagnosed in May. According to his spokesperson, the treatment plan for the 82-year-old also includes hormone therapy. This follows a successful Mohs surgery procedure in September to remove cancerous cells from his skin, after which his physician stated no further treatment was needed for that issue. Biden's office had previously disclosed that his prostate cancer appeared to be hormone-sensitive, suggesting it would likely respond well to treatment, which is expected to last for five weeks.</p>

The illegal facility in Meson do Vento had deplorable hygiene conditions, with cages covered in excrement and deceased animals in various stages of decomposition. Authorities rescued 171 other animals, including exotic birds, which were found in life-threatening conditions and had resorted to feeding on the dead for survival. The site manager faces charges of animal abuse, illegal possession of protected species, and practicing veterinary medicine without a license.</p>

          <p>Despite Africa being the world's youngest continent with a median age of 19, it is home to numerous gerontocracies, exemplified by Cameroon's 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who is seeking an eighth term after 43 years in power. He is not an isolated case; leaders in their 80s also rule in Malawi, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, and Zimbabwe, often amending constitutions to extend their tenures. This trend, dubbed "third-termism" by analysts, creates a stark contrast with the continent's youthful population. However, there are signs of change, with youth-led protests emerging in several countries and some younger leaders, like Burkina Faso's 37-year-old interim president, rising to prominence.</p>

          <p>A drone strike, allegedly carried out by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has killed dozens of people, including children, at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, Sudan. Local activists reported that the Dar al-Arqam camp was hit by two drones and multiple artillery shells, describing a scene of horrific carnage with many victims burned beyond recognition. The attack has overwhelmed the city's already struggling hospitals, which have been under siege by the RSF for 17 months. El-Fasher is the Sudanese army's last major stronghold in the Darfur region, and its potential fall could allow the RSF to control the entire territory.</p>

          <p>A potential historic peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which could end the war in Gaza, is being largely attributed to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. According to political analysts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built his career on understanding American politics, recognized the necessity of U.S. support amid shifting global sentiment. Consequently, when President Trump applied significant pressure, it became a decisive factor in bringing the parties to the table for a deal. The agreement marks a major turning point in the long-running conflict, with President Trump now preparing to visit the Middle East.</p>

MLS is increasingly seen not just as a destination for high-profile stars but as a development league that scouts, develops, and transfers young international talent.

          <p>Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from some areas, Hamas has mobilized approximately 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control and counter what it calls "outlaws and collaborators" in Gaza. The move comes amid rising internal tensions, highlighted by the killing of two Hamas members by gunmen from the powerful Dughmush clan, sparking fears of wider internal conflict. Hamas has also appointed five new governors with military backgrounds, signaling a hardline approach to governance. This development complicates the U.S.-brokered peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm, as the group insists its weapons are for resisting occupation.</p>

          <p>During a television appearance, former President Donald Trump made a series of mathematically impossible claims regarding future drug price reductions. He stated that while his first term saw a minor reduction of one-eighth of one percent, new policies would lead to drug prices going down by "100 percent, 400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent in some cases." A price reduction cannot exceed 100 percent, as that would imply the price becomes zero or negative. He asserted that these purported cuts would have a huge, positive impact on programs like Social Security and Medicare by lowering prescription drug purchasing costs.</p>

Recent disclosures confirm that Berkshire's stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi have surpassed the 10% threshold, indicating strong confidence in these long-term investments.
