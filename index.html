          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has condemned recent US airstrikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea, labeling them an "act of tyranny." Petro, in an interview, called for criminal proceedings against US officials if investigations confirm Colombian deaths. He argued that stopping boats and arresting crews is sufficient, questioning the necessity of missile strikes that have reportedly killed 17 people. The US maintains the strikes are vital to halt fentanyl flow, while legal experts and lawmakers debate their adherence to international human rights laws.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Lula da Silva indicated that Ukrainian President Zelensky appears more willing to engage in peace discussions than in previous meetings, noting a similar sentiment from Putin. Lula emphasized the United Nations' crucial role in leading negotiations, advocating for the organization to regain its authority as a spokesperson for member states. This renewed push for a Brazil-China peace plan follows a rare alignment with the US on a ceasefire initiative in March. The six-point plan includes humanitarian access, prisoner exchanges, and civilian protection, previously dismissed by Ukraine as "destructive."</p>

South Korea's Kospi was flat, but defense stocks increased, while Taiwan's Taiex fell, impacted by TSMC's decline amid Intel-Apple investment reports. US stock futures remained stable as investors awaited jobless claims data, which could influence Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Eyewitnesses described a chaotic and horrific scene in one of the city’s busiest corridors, with a nearby vendor noting the woman was tragically under the van as it reversed. The NYPD's Highway District’s Collision Investigation Squad is currently investigating the incident, but no arrests have been made yet, leaving the community seeking answers.</p>

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, saw its shares jump 11% in its Hong Kong debut after a $1.2 billion IPO, despite canceling its listing ceremony due to a typhoon. The automaker is rapidly expanding in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Europe, with its Jetour sub-brand entering Europe soon. Industry experts note Chery's growing strength and manufacturing presence in multiple countries, mitigating some risks from tariffs imposed by the US, Canada, and the EU on Chinese EVs. The company's diversified approach positions it well amidst global trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House announced it would pursue permanent layoffs, not just temporary furloughs, for federal workers if the government shuts down on October 1. This "reduction in force" would target programs deemed inconsistent with the president's priorities, a significant departure from past shutdowns. OMB Director Russell Vought advocates for presidential control over spending, despite disagreements from Democrats and the GAO. Senate Democrats are currently at an impasse with House Republicans over a funding bill, with the White House suggesting layoffs could be avoided if Democrats support the House bill.</p>

This surge, led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, is largely attributed to massive energy plants developed by Chinese firms.

          <p>Former US President Barack Obama stated that the US is embroiled in a "tug of war" between two distinct visions for its future, criticizing both populist conservatives like Trump and "smug" progressives. Speaking in London, Obama described one vision as progressive, rooted in democracy, and the other as a return to a more conservative, hierarchical worldview championed by his successor. He suggested that progressives became complacent when their values were not tested, contrasting it with the current challenges. The article highlights Obama's perspective on the deep political divisions in the country.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension garnered an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, quadrupling his average audience and achieving the highest ratings since March 2015. The surge occurred despite about a quarter of ABC affiliates preempting the show. Kimmel's monologue, addressing his controversial comments on Charlie Kirk's death, also amassed over 26 million views online. The suspension, reportedly influenced by FCC threats and affiliate decisions, has sparked a corporate fallout, with Disney shareholders demanding transparency regarding political pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A meta-analysis of existing research has revealed the unsettling discovery of microplastics within human bone tissue, prompting scientists to sound an alarm. Researchers note a significant gap in understanding microplastics' influence on bone diseases, despite evidence suggesting they affect cell viability, modify gene expression, and trigger inflammatory responses. Experimental animal studies indicate microplastic ingestion disturbs gut microbiota and reduces white blood cell counts, compromising bone marrow function crucial for blood cell creation. This discovery underscores the pervasive threat of microplastic pollution to human and animal health, emphasizing the urgent need to reduce plastic production.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump claimed "triple sabotage" at the United Nations after experiencing an escalator stoppage, teleprompter failure, and microphone issues during his address. He described the events as "sinister" and demanded an immediate investigation, involving the Secret Service. The UN, however, stated a US delegation videographer inadvertently triggered the escalator's safety function. Despite technical difficulties, Trump's combative speech, questioning the UN's purpose and warning European allies about migration, was widely heard.

The letter, from unions and Reporters Without Borders, cites a $4 billion drop in Disney's stock value and threats from FCC Chair Brendan Carr as potential influences. While Disney attributed the suspension to Kimmel's "ill-timed" remarks about Charlie Kirk's death, the shareholders suspect external pressure related to upcoming media mergers. They threaten legal action if Disney fails to provide transparency, highlighting concerns over free speech and corporate fiduciary duties.</p>

          <p>The US tech sector is scrambling after President Trump signed an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled foreign worker visa applications. While initially clarified to apply only to future applicants, the fee poses a crippling burden, especially for startups and smaller firms beyond tech. Experts warn this "anti-growth policymaking" could lead to a "brain drain" and prompt companies to offshore operations, rather than hiring US workers at an equivalent skill level. Supporters argue major tech companies can absorb the cost, but critics contend the policy will not balance the labor market or benefit American workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at a UK government lab have made a significant breakthrough in fusion energy, designing an exhaust system that dramatically reduces extreme heat within fusion reactors. This "Super-X divertor" creates a neutral gas buffer, providing more space to cool plasma before it hits reactor walls, crucial for making nuclear fusion practical. This advancement, a collaborative effort, addresses one of fusion's biggest challenges. Fusion energy offers a clean, nearly limitless power source without long-lasting radioactive waste, potentially playing a pivotal role in reducing fossil fuel reliance and accelerating renewable energy adoption.</p>
