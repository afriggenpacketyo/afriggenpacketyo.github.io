          <p>China's labor market is facing increased vulnerability due to a chronic housing slowdown and high youth unemployment, making it more susceptible to the impacts of trade tensions with the United States. Economists warn that a full-blown trade war could result in millions of manufacturing job losses, exacerbating existing economic struggles. While China and the U.S. have temporarily reduced tariffs, the threat of renewed trade conflict looms large. Many companies are hesitant to hire women who are married without children because they do not want to have to potentially cover the cost of parental leave, and even those with jobs are in a more precarious position, with fewer companies offering full-time employment.</p>

High-tech manufacturing and household appliance sectors saw notable improvements, supported by government subsidies and consumer trade-in schemes. However, the automobile and apparel sectors faced challenges due to price competition and shifting demand. Weining Yu from the NBS cautioned that constraints such as insufficient demand and external uncertainty persist. (not investment advice)</p>

The subsidies are projected to reduce household energy bills by 1,040 yen in July and September, and by 1,260 yen in August.

          <p>A federal judge expressed frustration with the government's failure to provide due process to deportees held in Djibouti, whom the Trump administration is trying to send to South Sudan. Judge Brian E. Murphy criticized the logistical challenges of holding immigration proceedings on another continent. The judge had previously ordered that the migrants be given a chance to express fear of persecution if sent to South Sudan. The case involves a class-action lawsuit considering the due process rights of migrants facing deportation to third countries.</p>

          <p>A recent study found that some beers brewed in the U.S. contain high levels of "forever chemicals" (PFAS) exceeding EPA limits. The research team modified an EPA testing tool to analyze PFAS levels in 23 beers, discovering elevated levels in beers from North Carolina, California, and Michigan. The study found a strong correlation between PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water and locally brewed beer. International beers from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable PFAS.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its status as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite its net external assets rising to a record high.

Japan's gross external assets increased to 533.05 trillion yen ($3.7 trillion), but Germany's total was higher at 569.65 trillion yen.
