          <h2>Self-Custody of Cryptocurrency Presents Growing Global Risks</h2>

          <p>The decision of where to store cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, is consequential, with self-custody presenting unique security challenges. Events like wildfires and global conflicts have prompted crypto holders to reconsider their storage approaches. While third-party platforms offer convenience, self-custody provides control but requires robust security measures, such as multi-signature setups and diversified storage locations, to mitigate risks like natural disasters and unexpected death. The industry is evolving to offer solutions that balance convenience and security, but the tension remains a roadblock to wider crypto adoption.

          <h2>Op-Ed Warns of Implementation Challenges for Trump's Tariff Regime</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An op-ed warns that President Trump's new tariff regime, triggered by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, faces significant implementation challenges. The author argues that the policy goals surpass the capacity of the current federal government to effectively implement the tariffs, citing underfunding, understaffing, and a lack of interagency coordination. The piece suggests that the policy relies on signaling over processes and structure, potentially leading to economic distortions and retaliatory tariffs. It also highlights the lack of a formal rulemaking process and the limited role of Congress in overseeing the policy.</p>

          <p>Homebuilders are facing a surplus of unsold homes, leading to price cuts and incentives like mortgage rate buydowns. The growing inventory reflects a slowdown in demand after a pandemic-driven surge, with higher mortgage rates and affordability issues shutting out potential buyers. While the market has turned in buyers' favor, builders are slowing down construction activity to clear their backlogs. The situation presents opportunities for buyers, particularly in certain regions, to secure favorable deals on new construction homes.
