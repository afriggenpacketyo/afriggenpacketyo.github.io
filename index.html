          <p>China has introduced a new set of ethical guidelines for the development and application of autonomous driving technologies. The regulations, issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology, prioritize human life and safety, demanding that systems actively minimize harm in unavoidable accidents. To ensure accountability, the guidelines also mandate that all algorithms and models be transparent, clearly documented, and readily available for inspection by regulators. This move aims to manage ethical risks and promote the healthy growth of the autonomous vehicle sector.</p>

          <h2>Serbian Student-Led Protest Movement Faces Ideological Divisions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A student protest movement in Serbia, which began united in demanding accountability after a deadly building collapse, is now showing signs of ideological fracture. Initially, the movement rejected political affiliations, focusing on justice under the slogan "You've got blood on your hands." However, as the protests grew, nationalist symbols and rhetoric began to appear, leading to criticism that the movement was being co-opted. Despite these internal rifts, research suggests the protests have positively influenced youth attitudes towards democracy.</p>

          <p>China is launching a program to provide monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care. The initiative is designed to ease the financial strain on families with aging members and stimulate consumption in the care services sector. The electronic coupons, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be available to seniors assessed as having moderate to severe disabilities. This policy represents a rare use of direct fiscal support by Beijing to strengthen its social safety net. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve headquarters, continuing his public pressure campaign on its chair, Jerome Powell. For months, Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting interest rates, which he believes would stimulate the economy. The tension has recently escalated, with the president suggesting that cost overruns on a Fed building renovation project, now estimated at $2.5 billion, could be grounds for firing Powell. This direct confrontation threatens the central bank's long-held political independence. (not investment advice)</p>

This suggests that our bodies compensate for activity levels to maintain a stable energy output. The findings provide strong evidence that the dramatic shift in our food supply, particularly the rise of ultra-processed foods, is the primary driver of the obesity epidemic.</p>

The casualties include civilians, and both nations have evacuated thousands of residents from the area. The fighting, which involved gunfire, rockets, and Thai air strikes, marks a serious escalation of a century-old border dispute. Both countries have accused the other of initiating the hostilities, further plunging their bilateral relations to a new low.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders as part of an "American AI Action Plan," vowing to keep what he terms "woke AI" out of the federal government. One order directs agencies not to procure AI models that sacrifice accuracy for ideological agendas like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Other orders aim to remove regulatory hurdles to spur AI innovation and establish a program to support the export of U.S. AI technology. The move aligns with the administration's broader effort to phase out DEI initiatives.</p>

A spokesperson called the story "fake news," although an unnamed official reportedly did not deny his name is in the files. This development occurs as the Trump administration faces growing pressure to release more information about the convicted sex offender, and after a House subcommittee voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its records on the case.</p>

          <p>The UK's vehicle manufacturing industry has recorded its worst first-half-year performance since 1953, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car production fell by 7.3%, while van production plummeted by 45%. The slump is attributed to uncertainty over US tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production, and the closure of a major van plant. Despite a recent tariff deal with the US, the industry does not expect a swift return to previous output levels. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is confronting an unusual oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy incineration sector, where massive investment has outpaced the actual supply of trash. While incineration capacity has more than doubled since 2019, the amount of municipal solid waste has grown by only 11%, leaving an estimated 40% of capacity idle. Experts attribute the slower-than-expected growth in waste to factors like an economic downturn and a deceleration in urbanization. This has created a situation where the optimistically planned industry is now struggling to find enough fuel to burn.</p>

Green described the mission as a combination of his love for the outdoors and mountain biking, with the biggest challenge being the logistics and time away from his family.</p>
