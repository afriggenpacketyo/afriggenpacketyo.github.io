          <p>An attack at Boulder's Pearl Street Mall in Colorado injured at least five people during a march for Israeli hostages; the suspect is now in custody. Witnesses reported the suspect threw Molotov cocktails, causing burns to the victims, and allegedly shouted "End Zionist!" during the incident. The FBI initially called it a targeted terrorist attack, but Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn stated it was too early to make that determination, emphasizing the ongoing investigation and the need to interview witnesses. Three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated as investigators examined a vehicle of interest, and officials are working to determine the attacker's motive, while condemning the hate-filled act. The optimism score is not directly related to the events described in the article.</p>

          <p>Nearly 40 years after the Lockerbie disaster, a BBC Scotland documentary shares less well-known stories about the victims of Pan Am 103 and their families. The bombing killed all 259 passengers and crew, along with 11 Lockerbie residents, marking the biggest terror attack on British soil. The documentary features interviews with family members and friends of victims like Tim Burman, Olive Gordon, and William MacAllister, highlighting their lost potential and the lasting impact on their loved ones. The community's response, including the Lockerbie laundry project, symbolized the compassion shown to the victims' families during the tragedy, with one family member expressing gratitude for the humanity displayed by the town's residents.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the Memorial Tournament, finishing at 10-under 278 and winning by four strokes, joining Tiger Woods as the only repeat winners. Despite a strong challenge from Ben Griffin, who closed within two shots late in the round, Scheffler's consistent play and Griffin's late double bogey secured Scheffler's win. This marks Scheffler's third win in his last four starts, further solidifying his position as world number one, while tournament host Jack Nicklaus praised Scheffler's performance, noting similarities to his own playing style. The performances on the course led to a final score that resulted in Scheffler taking home the top prize.</p>

The California Interscholastic Federation implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports, and former President Trump threatened to pull federal funding from the state if Hernandez competed.

          <p>Crystal McKinney, who previously sued Sean "Diddy" Combs for sexual assault, has now filed an amended lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, accusing him of sexual assault in 2003. McKinney alleges that Weinstein sexually assaulted her and a friend at a New York City hotel after a meeting set up under the guise of a potential business opportunity. The lawsuit details allegations of Weinstein plying the women with alcohol, demanding they strip and take a bath with him, and ultimately sexually assaulting McKinney. Weinstein's lawyer denies the claims, suggesting they are opportunistic and suspiciously timed after McKinney's lawsuit against Combs.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing and returning her pardon issued by Trump. Hemphill believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine the legitimacy of the legal proceedings, stating that she and others involved were guilty. She worked with Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons to use in court, and she expects her protest to garner attention from Trump.</p>

Despite numerous appeals to official bodies and support from Members of Parliament, Williams has been told his pension reflects his full and correct entitlement based on the rules at the time of his discharge. Williams hopes that by speaking out, he can bring attention to his case and potentially help other veterans affected by similar issues.</p>

Smoke from the fires has worsened air quality and reduced visibility, prompting health warnings and the deployment of firefighters and equipment from other provinces and U.S. states.

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses factors negatively impacting the stock market, attributing it to unpredictability stemming from the White House and inconsistent policies. He points out how this "Trump discount" affects various sectors, including Nvidia, retail, drug, food, Apple, software, bank, and energy stocks, noting that uncertainty deters investors despite strong performance from some companies. Cramer suggests the market's instability is due to the power of the presidency to influence the economy with a stroke of a pen, leading to a situation where American companies are undervalued compared to their European counterparts. The article concludes by expressing concern over the derision of business and the overall uncertainty, suggesting a longing for a more predictable environment.</p>

          <p>Pharmacists are warning that a drug shortage is severely impacting cancer patients, specifically noting the scarcity of Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert) essential for digestion. Patients with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis are affected, with some reportedly skipping meals to ration their medication, as reported by the National Pharmacy Association (NPA). The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledges European-wide supply issues caused by manufacturing constraints and is working with industry and the NHS to mitigate the impact. Without Creon, patients risk losing weight and strength, reducing their ability to cope with treatments like chemotherapy, and experts predict shortages may continue into the next year.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a drone attack deep into Russian territory, claiming to have destroyed 40 military bombers in an operation reportedly supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian security sources said the drones were smuggled inside mobile wooden cabins carried by trucks, hitting airfields including the Belaya air base. Meanwhile, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia, resulting in casualties, and Zelenskyy announced a Ukrainian delegation will meet with Russian representatives in Istanbul to discuss a ceasefire and prisoner exchange. The drone strikes come as Kyiv deals with Russian military strikes which killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site.</p>

Rushdie, who has personal experience with censorship due to the fatwa issued against him for 'The Satanic Verses,' argued that suppressing speech often impacts minority groups first.

          <p>A 60 Minutes report explores why Australian actors are overrepresented in Hollywood, citing factors such as strong training grounds like NIDA, a 'can-do' attitude, and a lack of self-importance. NIDA, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, provides rigorous training in the classics and accent work, while Aussie soap operas offer actors a testing ground to hone their skills. The report also highlights the influence of figures like John Clark, NIDA's former director, who fostered a distinct Aussie mode of acting, and the importance of institutions like the Sydney Theatre Company. The report concludes that the remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their talents away from the pressures of Hollywood.</p>
