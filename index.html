          <p>The U.S. government has lifted its export restrictions on chip-design software to China, a move announced by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA. This reversal comes after the Commerce Department imposed controls in May and is widely interpreted as a positive step towards a U.S.-China trade truce. Following the news, the stock prices of the affected American companies, which are dominant in the electronic design automation market, saw a significant increase. The development occurs as China continues its strategic push to develop its own independent semiconductor capabilities.</p>

This violent event marks the second mass shooting at this specific location, which was previously known as the Hush Lounge before being shut down following a similar incident in November 2022.

          <p>After hours of delays and intense negotiations, the U.S. House of Representatives voted narrowly to advance President Trump's major tax and spending legislation for a final debate. Republican leadership struggled to overcome significant pushback from their own party members who were displeased with changes made to the bill by the Senate. President Trump was reportedly directly involved, pressuring holdouts to support the package, which extends tax cuts and increases border security funding while cutting social programs. The bill's passage through this procedural hurdle marks a key step in enacting a signature piece of Trump's second-term agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence provided by the city council. The watchdog stated that some documents were so obscured they were impossible to assess, particularly affecting inquiries like Operation Green Jacket. While the report noted that Greater Manchester Police has since made significant improvements in its handling of such cases, past failures have led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" among some victims. A new information-sharing protocol has since been established between the police, council, and prosecutors.</p>

The tribute, attributed to the Institute of Party History and Literature, praised Li as an "outstanding member of the party" who made significant contributions to the nation. Li passed away from a heart attack in October 2023, just months after concluding his term as premier. The official acknowledgment aligns with the party's tradition of honoring senior leaders on major birth anniversaries, reflecting his recognized status within the political establishment.</p>

          <p>The UK's financial markets experienced a sharp shock after Chancellor Rachel Reeves was seen crying in Parliament, causing the pound to fall and bond yields to spike amid speculation about her job security. Prime Minister Keir Starmer later sought to calm the situation, stating he and the chancellor were in "lockstep" and attributing her distress to a personal matter. The incident occurred during a period of political difficulty for the Labour government, which recently made a major U-turn on welfare reform, creating a hole in the budget. This has intensified scrutiny on the government's economic strategy and its ability to maintain fiscal discipline.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas due to the prevalence of heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt. This effect, which can raise temperatures by up to 15 degrees Celsius, intensifies heatwaves for the more than half of the world's population living in cities. Factors contributing to this phenomenon include tall buildings trapping heat, a lack of cooling vegetation, and pollution. Proposed solutions include increasing green spaces, installing reflective "cool roofs" and pavements, and adding water features to help mitigate the dangerous effects of extreme urban heat.</p>

According to U.S. Coast Guard data, common mistakes include overloading boats, passengers riding unsafely on the bow, and failing to wear life jackets. Capt. Geoff Fahringer, a career law enforcement officer and boating captain, emphasizes the importance of safety training and pre-departure checklists. He also advises boaters to carry and monitor a VHF radio for distress calls, as cell phones are often unreliable offshore, and to be prepared to act as their own first responders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has shed light on the origins of Uralic languages, such as Finnish and Hungarian, by combining genetic, linguistic, and archaeological data. Researchers analyzed ancient DNA to trace the migration of Uralic-speaking populations from Siberia across Eurasia between 4,000 and 11,000 years ago. The findings support the theory that the Ural Mountains region is the ancestral homeland and show how these groups spread west to the Baltic and east into Asia. This migration also brought technological advancements, like metallurgy, and left a distinct genetic signature still present in the approximately 25 million Uralic speakers today.</p>

          <p>According to top-ranked Chinese brokerages like GF Securities and Industrial Securities, China's stock market is expected to see little growth in the latter half of the year due to a lack of significant catalysts. Analysts suggest that while state intervention and a weak economic recovery may prevent a major downturn, issues like deflationary pressures and slow earnings growth will likely keep stock performance flat. This cautious domestic outlook contrasts with more optimistic views from global banks on Hong Kong stocks, which are seen as potentially benefiting from global interest rate changes.

          <p>Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska defended his support for President Trump's sweeping spending bill, arguing that a 'no' vote would effectively be a vote to raise taxes on middle-class families. While acknowledging concerns over Senate-led changes to Medicaid, Bacon stated the bill's core aim is to implement work requirements for able-bodied adults, not to remove coverage from those in need. The legislation has faced a difficult path in the House, with opposition from both moderate Republicans worried about insurance losses and fiscal conservatives concerned about the national debt. The White House and House leadership have been pressuring holdouts to secure passage.</p>

          <p>Under new manager Mauricio Pochettino, the U.S. Men's National Team has rediscovered its grit and competitive spirit, advancing to the Gold Cup final against Mexico. After a period of uninspired performances, Pochettino has instilled a renewed sense of fight and defensive organization in the young squad. A key moment was a feisty quarterfinal win over Costa Rica, where the team's unified response to an on-field altercation demonstrated a new level of cohesion. This return to a mentality-driven, high-intensity style, combined with tactical sophistication, has been crucial to their recent success.</p>

Despite his lack of recent international play, Lions coach Andy Farrell, his father, had previously confirmed Owen was in the selection conversation due to his experience and leadership.
