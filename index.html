          <p>China has approved the mass production of its domestically developed AG600, the world's largest amphibious aircraft, marking a significant advancement in the country's aviation industry. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified the plane, confirming that the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic) has established a reliable system for consistent and safe aircraft production. This approval is a milestone towards a more high-end and standardized civil aviation manufacturing sector, strengthening China's ability to independently build a complete civil aviation ecosystem. The AG600 is part of China's broader initiative to build a self-reliant civil aviation industry, particularly in light of recent US technology restrictions.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is positioning itself as a leader in the stablecoin market with the passage of comprehensive stablecoin laws, aiming to gain an edge over the US and Singapore. The new legislation reflects the city's determination to unlock value in the digital asset sector, addressing past industry setbacks. This move, combined with Hong Kong's vast offshore yuan holdings and China's restricted cryptocurrency use, fuels hopes that Hong Kong could secure a prominent spot in the stablecoin market. The ordinance takes effect on August 1, giving the market a lead in Asia, with a friendlier regulatory stance than Singapore's framework introduced last year.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources speaking to CBS News, U.S. officials have been informed that Israel is fully prepared to launch an operation into Iran. The U.S. anticipates potential retaliation from Iran against American sites in neighboring Iraq, which is a reason for the State Department's order for non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq. Despite these tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days. Trump reiterated the U.S. does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons studied belonged to a species that is now the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters during the Jurassic period to the formidable giants of the Cretaceous period. The new species also exhibits early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' powerful jaws and bite forces.</p>

While the procedural vote passed along party lines, the final vote may face resistance from Republicans concerned about targeting popular programs.

          <p>Mainland China scientists have created an ultra-detailed electronic war game simulation covering Taiwan and adjacent seas, modeling intricate landforms with nanosecond-level precision. The simulation, developed by a team led by Professor Shao Shihai from the University of Electronic Science and Technology in Chengdu, emulates electromagnetic battlespace scenarios. The simulation covers a vast theatre spanning Taiwan and adjacent seas, modelling intricate landforms with nanosecond-level precision. The system improves computational speed while maintaining precision, fulfilling the requirements for channel modelling in large-scale battlefield environments.</p>

While a blind taste test revealed frozen dough may not match the quality of artisanal bakeries, the company is adapting to Asian-inspired flavors and halal certification to cater to diverse markets.</p>
