          <p>Facing record-high rice prices due to a poor harvest in 2023, Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestic rice, following similar moves by Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. The company hopes that offering consumers a choice will increase overall rice consumption, as they can no longer purchase rice as before due to higher prices. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan hailed the sale of U.S.-grown rice as "historic" for American farmers and timely for Japanese consumers concerned about food prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the UK prepares to ban disposable vapes starting June 1st, many vapers are panic-buying to stockpile their preferred devices. Concerns are rising among the vaping community, particularly those who successfully quit smoking using disposable vapes, fearing a return to cigarettes if they cannot easily access or use rechargeable alternatives. Retailers are seeing a surge in sales of disposable vapes, with some experiencing sales doubling in recent weeks. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb vaping among children, but some argue it may lead ex-smokers back to traditional cigarettes.</p>

          <p>Following a new round of talks with U.S. officials, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is showing growing recognition of Japan's economic significance. Akazawa had "more frank and in-depth discussions" with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington, and expressed his desire for a mutually beneficial agreement next month. The approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel by Trump was seen as a symbolic development, and economic security issues are central to the negotiations. However, Japan's unwavering stance is to eliminate all additional tariffs, a challenging prospect given the Trump administration's firm position.</p>

The film captures a liminal state in Uma's life, as she navigates the oppressive city and discovers hidden strength. Radhika Apte's performance as Uma is captivating, portraying a character whose middle-finger energy is offset by a silent-film-star haplessness. Though the film's episodic nature can feel disjointed, its visual curiosity and punk potential create a trippy and blackly funny experience.</p>

The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs, enhancing the country's inland waterway network.

          <p>Satellite images have revealed the extent of damage to a North Korean naval destroyer following a failed launch ceremony. The 5,000-ton ship is shown twisted and partially submerged in the port of Chongjin. Kim Jong Un reportedly blamed military officials for the incident, citing "carelessness and irresponsibility." The launch was intended to showcase the nation's military strength but instead became a source of embarrassment, prompting Kim to demand repairs before the upcoming Workers Party meeting.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative comes amid rising criticism of the government's failure to curb soaring rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year. The government plans to initially release 300,000 tons of rice and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. While this may provide some relief, analysts remain uncertain whether it will significantly impact overall rice prices due to limited reserves.</p>

Debris from intercepted missiles and drones fell in several districts, causing injuries and fires. The prisoner swap involved the release of 390 individuals from each side, but the attacks highlight the continued intensity of the war.</p>

          <p>Cuts to National Weather Service (NWS) balloon sites, enacted by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are leaving gaps in crucial weather data, impacting forecasting accuracy. Meteorologists say the lack of data from these sites, including those in Michigan and Wisconsin, hindered accurate predictions during a recent ice storm and severe thunderstorms. The data collected by weather balloons, including air pressure and moisture levels, is irreplaceable and cannot be adequately substituted by satellites or radar. Former NWS leaders have warned that staffing and program cuts could lead to needless loss of life due to understaffed weather forecast offices.</p>

          <p>Fears of a trade war between the US and the EU have been reignited after Europe refused to back down following new tariff threats from President Trump. Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the EU after claiming trade talks were "going nowhere". The European Commission, overseeing trade for the 27-country bloc, responded by stating that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect and that they stand ready to defend their interests. This comes as Trump also threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple if they did not shift some iPhone production to the US.</p>
