          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 17:22:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trade dispute between the US and Canada intensified after President Trump alleged that a Canadian ad distorted former President Ronald Reagan's views on tariffs. The article presents Reagan's full 1987 address on trade, where he discussed imposing duties on Japanese products as a "special case" for unfair practices, yet generally warned that tariffs harm American workers and consumers and can trigger trade wars. Trump asserted Reagan "LOVED TARIFFS," contrasting with the Canadian ad's emphasis on Reagan's free trade advocacy. This piece uniquely offers the complete context for readers to compare the ad's message with Reagan's original remarks, highlighting the nuances of his historical position on trade policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has conducted at least 10 intermittent strikes on alleged drug boats in international waters off South America since September, resulting in at least 43 deaths. President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth assert the operations target drug smugglers and are authorized without congressional approval, though some lawmakers and Colombian President Gustavo Petro question their legality and effectiveness. Most strikes occurred in the Caribbean, expanding to the Eastern Pacific, with Trump suggesting future land-based operations. A specific incident on October 24 against a Venezuelan gang vessel killed six individuals, while survivors have faced repatriation and prosecution, sometimes without evidence of crime.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to become a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by Sunday, posing a severe threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The storm is expected to bring days of heavy downpours, with up to 25 inches of rain in some areas, potentially triggering catastrophic flash flooding and landslides. Its core is currently southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, moving north before a westward turn. While not anticipated to significantly impact the mainland United States, hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are in effect for parts of Haiti and Jamaica.</p>

          <p>A nationwide manhunt has been initiated in the UK for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national convicted of sexual assault, who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu, an asylum seeker, was slated for transfer to an immigration detention center before deportation. Justice Secretary David Lammy condemned the error, labeling Kebatu a "dangerous individual." Authorities confirmed he took a train to London. The Prison Service is investigating the incident, and an officer has been removed from duties. Kebatu received a 12-month sentence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and another woman, an event that previously incited public protests.</p>

          <p>U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis has summoned Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to a Chicago federal court hearing, stemming from accusations he violated a temporary restraining order. This order restricts federal agents' tactics against protesters and media during immigration enforcement in Illinois. Video evidence allegedly depicts Bovino deploying tear gas into a protesting crowd. While Bovino has defended his agency's actions, citing numerous arrests of "bad individuals" and "absolute chaos," he now must appear in court. The alleged violation concerns prohibitions on riot control weapons and unauthorized crowd dispersal, highlighting ongoing tensions between federal enforcement and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Deckers Brands' stock plunged 15% following a reduced sales outlook for its top brands, Hoka and Ugg, largely attributed to President Trump's tariffs impacting consumer demand.

Finance chief Steven Fasching confirmed that tariff-induced price increases are influencing consumer purchasing behavior in the discretionary sector. While CEO Dave Powers remains optimistic about long-term growth, the company expects significant tariff costs this year, highlighting the direct financial consequences of trade policies on businesses.

          <p>The Department of Justice announced it will send federal election monitors to specific counties in California and New Jersey for upcoming off-year elections, following requests from state Republican parties. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the goal is to ensure transparency and compliance with federal law. This move has drawn criticism from Democrats, who view it as a politically motivated tactic to interfere with elections and suppress votes, echoing President Trump's past rhetoric on election integrity. The California GOP cited concerns over voting irregularities, while New Jersey Republicans highlighted past voter fraud cases in Passaic County, intensifying the debate over election oversight.</p>

          <p>Charles Leclerc of Ferrari recorded the fastest time in the initial practice session for the Mexico City Grand Prix, narrowly ahead of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli. This session was notable for featuring nine rookie drivers from various teams, including Indycar's Pato O'Ward and Red Bull's Arvid Lindblad, who secured an impressive sixth place. Neither championship contenders Lando Norris nor Max Verstappen participated. The dusty circuit conditions typically render this session less representative of race day performance, yet it offered crucial track time for emerging talents and an early benchmark for the weekend's competitive dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family, and Interior Minister, alleging their involvement in the global drug trade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated Petro "has allowed drug cartels to flourish," sharply escalating tensions between the U.S. and its South American ally. This action follows Trump's previous threats to cut aid and impose tariffs, and his public labeling of Petro as an "illegal drug leader." Petro denies the accusations and plans to defend himself judicially in U.S. courts, while advocating a drug policy focused on crop substitution and combating money laundering, rather than a repressive approach.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian disclosed her brain aneurysm diagnosis in a reality show teaser, seemingly attributing it to stress. Medical experts clarify that while stress itself isn't a direct cause, it can raise blood pressure, a key factor in aneurysm development and enlargement. Doctors identify genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes as the main contributors. Though approximately 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm, most are small, asymptomatic, and pose no serious threat unless they rupture. Prevention primarily involves managing blood pressure and avoiding stimulants, with screenings advised for individuals with higher risk factors.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on President Trump's power to deploy troops in U.S. cities against local and state objections, a decision with significant implications for executive authority. The administration appealed judges' blocks on National Guard deployment in Chicago, arguing the president's discretion is exclusive. California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Governor Gavin Newsom warned against transforming the military into a "personal police force." Conservatives counter that the president must enforce federal law, citing historical precedents like desegregation. Lower courts in Portland and Chicago previously ruled against Trump, finding his justifications "untethered to the facts."</p>

          <p>Six men have been imprisoned in London for a Russian-orchestrated arson attack that caused £1.3 million in damage to a warehouse supplying aid to Ukraine. Ringleader Dylan Earl, recruited by the Wagner Group, received a 17-year sentence, becoming one of the first convicted under the new National Security Act. The court characterized the incident as a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" serving Russian state interests. Earl and his co-conspirators, who also planned to kidnap a Russian dissident, were driven by financial motives. This case underscores the increasing threat of hostile states employing proxies for criminal operations within the UK.</p>

Ontario initially defended the ad but later agreed to pause it to allow negotiations to resume. This dispute unfolds as both nations approach critical deadlines, including a review of the USMCA and a US Supreme Court hearing on Trump's authority to impose tariffs under emergency powers. The legal challenge could undermine the foundation for existing tariffs on Canadian goods. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized Canada's readiness for talks while also focusing on diversifying trade away from the U.S.</p>
