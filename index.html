          <p>Air Canada has suspended all its flights after more than 10,000 flight attendants, represented by their union, began a 72-hour strike. The industrial action is expected to disrupt travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily as the airline has grounded around 500 flights per day. The union is demanding higher salaries and compensation for ground time, rejecting the airline's offer of a 38% total compensation increase over four years as insufficient.</p>

As of June 2025, Chinese nationals constituted nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60% of those who had renewed their visas. This influx of investment, driven by the appeal of gaining residency in a European Union country, has had a quiet but profound impact on the Greek capital's real estate market.</p>

Putin maintained his long-standing position, stating that the conflict's root causes must be addressed, which implies Ukrainian territorial concessions and neutrality. Trump described the talks as having made "great progress" but acknowledged "we didn't get there," punting final negotiations to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is now scheduled to travel to Washington.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have expressed growing concern over the sustainability of Washington's expanding national debt, advocating for a gradual reduction in China's exposure to U.S. dollar assets. In a central bank-supervised publication, they noted that while U.S. Treasuries have not defaulted, their continued expansion is unsustainable. China has already been trimming its holdings, and the researchers recommend appropriately increasing reserves of gold and other strategic resources instead. (not investment advice)</p>
