            <p>A shooting at Florida State University in Tallahassee resulted in two fatalities and six injuries after a 20-year-old student opened fire near the student union. The suspect, Phoenix Ikner, was apprehended after being shot by police. The victims were not students, and the campus was placed on lockdown. The incident prompted a large law enforcement response, and classes were canceled. This is not the first shooting at FSU, raising concerns about campus safety and gun violence. The suspect used his mother's former service weapon, now owned by her as a personal handgun, which was found at the scene.</p>

            <p>New research suggests that Zheng He's Ming Dynasty Treasure Fleet may have played a role in spreading brown rats around the world. Ancient silk paintings from China's Ming dynasty provide evidence of rat domestication, predating previous records in Japan by over two centuries. Researchers propose that domesticated brown rats may have traveled as stowaways on Zheng He's ships, which traversed the oceans during the 15th century. Brown rats, now a widespread species, are believed to have originated in northern China and Mongolia.</p>

            <p>China's "Made in China 2025" plan, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in technology, has missed several key targets, according to the European Chamber of Commerce in China. While China has exceeded targets in the automotive sector, it has not yet reached its goals in aerospace, high-end robotics, and manufacturing value-added growth. The plan, which outlines a multi-decade strategy, has also fostered unhealthy industrial competition and worsened global trade tensions. Despite falling short, China has made significant progress in areas like shipbuilding, high-speed rail, and electric cars, transforming itself into a major global manufacturing force.</p>

            <p>A wind project is stalled in New York after U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum ordered a halt to an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. The decision disrupts a much-needed electricity supply to a region with growing power demands for things like data centers. Equinor, the company operating the project, has suspended construction. The move raises concerns about the future of offshore wind projects and the U.S.'s commitment to clean energy goals. New York has a goal of developing 9,000 megawatts in offshore wind energy by 2035.</p>
