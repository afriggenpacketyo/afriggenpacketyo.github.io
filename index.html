          <p>In a trial examining the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a commanding general testified that he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion," a key justification used by the administration. The lawsuit, brought by California's governor, questions whether the use of military forces to support federal law enforcement violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The testimony highlighted the military's role in protecting federal facilities and personnel, but also raised questions about the threshold for such deployments, creating a significant legal challenge for the administration.</p>

          <p>A former Maryland youth pastor, Thomas Pinkerton, has been arrested and charged with multiple felony and misdemeanor counts for allegedly sexually abusing at least six teenagers between 2006 and 2010. The alleged abuse, which included inappropriate touching and kissing, reportedly occurred at Central Christian Church and Pinkerton's home, with a seventh victim reported in Georgia. Pinkerton, who has pleaded not guilty, is believed to have more victims, and detectives are urging others to come forward as the investigation continues into these disturbing allegations.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes summit between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, European Union leaders have publicly appealed to the U.S. president to defend Ukraine's sovereignty and security. The EU is concerned that Trump might agree to a peace deal that forces Ukraine to cede Russian-held territory, a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected. As Russian forces appear to be advancing on the key city of Pokrovsk, European allies fear that any concessions to Putin could embolden further aggression and undermine international law.</p>

After months of stalled progress in Ukraine, Putin has offered a one-on-one meeting, which some analysts, including former national security adviser John Bolton, believe is a tactic to gain time and legitimacy. The primary concern is that Trump, eager for a peace deal, might accept Russia's maximalist terms, potentially alienating Ukraine and its European allies and shifting blame for the ongoing conflict onto Kyiv if they reject the agreement.</p>

          <p>An attorney for a detainee at a remote Florida immigration jail, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," has raised alarms about a rampant respiratory illness, possibly Covid-19, spreading through the facility. The lawyer claims his client and many other detainees are sick, with requests for masks being denied and limited access to showers, creating a "petri dish for disease." This report follows a claim from a former corrections officer who said she contracted Covid-19 at the unsanitary camp, adding to concerns about the health and safety of thousands held in the tented facility.</p>

Washington stated the group is responsible for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan's Balochistan province, including a recent train hijacking that killed 31 people. This formal designation, which tightens scrutiny on the group's supporters, coincides with a visit from Pakistan's army chief and a new U.S.-Pakistan trade agreement, and is seen as a move to counter terrorism and protect regional stability and investments.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent softening of his trade stance toward China, including a tariff pause, is viewed by analysts as a strategic maneuver to avoid economic disruption during the holiday season and gain leverage in broader negotiations. After imposing steep tariffs, Trump is now giving China more leeway than other countries like India, likely due to China's control over critical rare earth minerals and its willingness to endure a trade war. This tactical shift allows time for complex negotiations on technology, energy, and agricultural purchases while keeping economic pressure on Beijing through other means. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a collective tendency to romanticize the past, data shows the 1990s had drastically higher rates of violent crime and murder in the U.S. compared to today. Globally, extreme poverty was rampant, the HIV pandemic was largely unchecked, and social tolerance on issues like same-sex marriage was far lower, demonstrating that our positive memories often overlook the substantial progress made over the last three decades.</p>
