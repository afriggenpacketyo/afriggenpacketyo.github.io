          <p>This article fact-checks several claims made by President Trump regarding autism, vaccines, and Tylenol use during pregnancy. It refutes assertions that Amish children don't get autism due to lack of vaccination, clarifies the number of childhood vaccine doses, and states that no studies show Tylenol directly causes autism. Medical experts and scientific organizations contradict Trump's statements, emphasizing the known risks of fever during pregnancy and the genetic and environmental factors influencing autism likelihood.</p>

          <p>A Canadian investigation has concluded that TikTok's safeguards for children's data and preventing underage use are inadequate. The probe found that hundreds of thousands of Canadian children use the app despite its age restrictions, and TikTok collected sensitive personal information for targeted marketing. While TikTok disputes some findings, it has agreed to implement new measures to strengthen its platform for Canadian users. This scrutiny is part of a broader global examination of the Chinese-owned app's impact and security.</p>

          <p>During a Cleveland Guardians-Detroit Tigers game, Guardians player David Fry was hit in the face by a 99 mph fastball during a bunt attempt, leading to a scary scene. The ball deflected off his bat into his face, causing immediate pain and bleeding from his nose. Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal was visibly distraught, and Fry was removed from the game. The incident was ruled a foul ball, and the Guardians later scored, taking the lead.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a pioneering and highly respected scholar of Chinese law, has died at the age of 95. Cohen, a professor emeritus at NYU and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, significantly shaped global debates on China's legal system, trade, and human rights for over six decades. He was the first American to practice law in Communist China, authoring groundbreaking works on Chinese criminal procedure.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent 180-degree shift on Ukraine, where he now suggests Kyiv can win the war against Russia, questioning the sincerity behind his statements. While he called Russia a "paper tiger" after meeting President Zelenskyy and President Macron, the article notes a lack of concrete action items to support Ukraine's war effort. It suggests Trump's pronouncements might be a tantrum, a way to avoid humiliation, or even a prelude to normalizing relations with Russia by washing his hands of the conflict.</p>

          <p>California is moving to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services, with a bill awaiting the governor's signature. Inspired by a new mother whose baby was disturbed by loud ads, Senate Bill 576 would prohibit streaming platforms from playing commercials louder than their programming. While federal law already regulates broadcast and cable TV ads, streaming services were exempt. The industry initially opposed the bill, citing technical challenges, but changed its stance after an amendment removed the ability for private lawsuits.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is rehiring hundreds of federal employees laid off during Elon Musk's cost-cutting blitz at the General Services Administration (GSA). These employees, who managed government workspaces, are being asked to return after a seven-month paid vacation, during which the GSA faced high costs due to understaffing and lease issues. The reversal reflects how the Department of Government Efficiency's aggressive cuts went too far, leaving agencies "broken and understaffed" and leading to costly confusion.</p>

The party views Reform's rise as both a challenge for media attention and an opportunity to position themselves as a clear alternative.
