          <p>A widespread manhunt is actively in progress for the individual who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a public event at Utah Valley University. Kirk was fatally shot in the neck while addressing a crowd, prompting immediate campus lockdown and an extensive investigation. Authorities initially detained two individuals, George Zinn and Zachariah Qureshi, but subsequently released them after determining they had no ties to the shooting, though Zinn faces an obstruction charge. President Donald Trump and Utah Governor Spencer Cox denounced the killing as a political assassination, underscoring the gravity of the incident and the commitment to apprehending the perpetrator. The event has left the university community shaken, with classes canceled and multiple crime scenes being processed as the search continues.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA, held significant influence within Donald Trump's inner circle, acting as a crucial envoy to a new generation of conservatives. His death by assassination deeply affected the White House, with Trump and his son expressing profound grief and ordering flags to half-staff. Kirk's organization was instrumental in mobilizing young voters for Trump, shaping MAGA for a younger demographic through confrontational campus debates and advocacy against critical race theory and transgender rights. His loyalty to Trump, even amidst occasional disagreements, defined his political brand and cemented his status as a key figure in the conservative movement.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, at Clarence House in London for the first time since February 2024, signaling a potential small but significant step towards reconciliation. The private tea lasted approximately 50 minutes, with both Buckingham Palace and Harry's team maintaining unified silence on the details of their conversation. This meeting follows months of Harry expressing a desire for reconciliation and a noticeable shift in his public tone. While a full family reconciliation remains distant, especially with no signs of a meeting between Harry and Prince William, the encounter is seen as crucial for rebuilding their relationship.</p>

          <h2>Widespread Political Condemnation Follows Charlie Kirk's Assassination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 23:32:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has elicited widespread condemnation from political figures across the United States. President Trump attributed the killing to the "radical left," ordering flags to half-staff and emphasizing the dangers of demonizing political opponents. Former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, alongside numerous senators and representatives from both parties, expressed sorrow and denounced the act as despicable violence that has no place in American democracy. A proposed moment of silence in Congress, however, quickly escalated into a partisan shouting match, underscoring the profound divisions that persist despite calls for unity. Many leaders underscored the importance of vigorous, yet peaceful, debate in a democratic society.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung stated that companies would be "very hesitant" to invest in the US following a recent immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. Over 300 South Korean nationals, primarily mechanics installing production lines, were detained and are set to return home, a situation Lee described as "bewildering." The incident, which occurred amid sensitive trade talks, has sparked concern in Seoul about its impact on business activities and the US-South Korea alliance.

          <p>Eyewitnesses at Utah Valley University reported that conservative activist Charlie Kirk was discussing gun violence and control moments before he was fatally shot in the neck. Raydon DeChene described seeing Kirk grab his neck with blood pouring out after a single "pop" sound. Another witness, Jordan Last, confirmed Kirk was addressing a question about gun violence during his "Prove Me Wrong" event. The event, attended by over 3,000 people, reportedly had minimal security, with no metal detectors or extensive checks. The gunman remains at large, and authorities are investigating the targeted attack, while political leaders condemn the violence.</p>

The complaint claims FBI Director Kash Patel stated his job depended on firing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump, specifically mentioning the January 6 investigations. The agents, decorated veterans, were denied full pensions and assert that the purge aimed to punish law enforcement for doing their jobs, jeopardizing national security. The lawsuit highlights questions asked during vetting, such as political loyalties, and quotes an official saying "panic and anxiety" in the workforce "was the intent."</p>

          <p>A Redfin report claims San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal," meaning they are at July 2018 levels when considering the mortgage payment-to-income ratio. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth and falling mortgage rates, coupled with significantly faster wage growth for tech workers. However, "normal" still means San Francisco households spend 74% of their income on mortgages, far exceeding the national average. The report cautions that this trend doesn't reflect the reality for renters, as the AI boom continues to drive up rents and displace lower-wage tenants. (not investment advice)</p>

Scientists stress that definitive conclusions require in-depth analysis of these samples back on Earth, a mission currently on hold due to cost and logistical challenges. The samples from Neretva Vallis, a former river channel, show organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, compounds often produced by microorganisms on Earth.

This inequity means some patients miss out on life-saving treatments.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in excerpts from her upcoming book "107 Days," criticizes former President Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election, stating it shouldn't have been "left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition." Harris labels the choice as "recklessness" given the high stakes, and also expresses deep criticism of Biden's inner circle for not defending her against attacks and even fueling negative narratives about her. While defending Biden's capacity, she acknowledges he "got tired" but asserts her loyalty to the country above all else.</p>

          <p>History teachers across the US are diligently working to keep the lessons of 9/11 alive for a new generation of students who were not alive during the attacks. Ann Krois, a teacher in Iowa, emphasizes the importance of understanding the trauma and global unity that followed the catastrophe. Many educators participate in programs at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, learning from survivors and first responders like retired firefighter Bill Spade. This commitment ensures students grasp the patriotic and messy sides of the event, fostering resilience and highlighting the achievements possible when people work together.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken provides five science-backed tips for managing stress, emphasizing that it is a normal and unavoidable part of life. His advice includes accepting stress rather than worrying about its effects, engaging in exercise to help the body manage cortisol spikes, prioritizing consistent sleep routines, and focusing on self-care through good nutrition and alone time. He advocates for mindfulness as intentional living rather than formal meditation, suggesting planning ahead to pace oneself. These practical strategies aim to empower individuals to regain control and build resilience against life's challenges.</p>

          <p>China is pursuing a "lean and mean" artificial intelligence strategy, focusing on practical applications and less on massive investments compared to the US. Beijing has launched an $8.42 billion national AI fund and plans to integrate AI across its economy and society through the "AI+" initiative. Despite US restrictions on advanced chips, Chinese companies are producing competitive, often cheaper, generative AI models, leveraging "resourcefulness and adaptation." While past semiconductor ambitions had mixed results, this current push aims to make China a global AI innovation center by 2030, though analysts warn about potential overcapacity in infrastructure.

          <p>A proposed California bill, introduced last-minute without public input, would require electric customers to pay an additional $9 billion into the state's wildfire fund by extending a monthly surcharge for another decade. This deal, lobbied for by major electric companies, aims to replenish the $21-billion fund, which faces depletion from potential damages of the Eaton fire. While consumer advocates expressed disappointment over increased rates, they noted the bill also mandates utilities to use lower-cost public financing for transmission projects and spend billions more on wildfire prevention without profit. The legislation's swift passage is sought as wildfire season begins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli missile strike in Doha, targeting senior Hamas officials who were considering a US-brokered peace deal, has likely ended negotiations and severely strained US-Qatar relations. Qatar, the indispensable mediator, expressed outrage over the attack on its sovereign territory, making its continued role uncertain. Israeli officials, while not mourning potential Hamas deaths, questioned the strategic benefit, especially for the remaining hostages. US officials, including President Trump, were privately furious, fearing the strike could "disembowel" truce efforts and might have been a political move by Netanyahu ahead of a Gaza City offensive.</p>

          <p>Nepal's government has been toppled by a violent uprising following anti-government demonstrations and a social media ban, leading to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's resignation and several deaths. This instability, reminiscent of recent events in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, poses a significant challenge for India's neighborhood diplomacy due to deep historical, economic, and strategic ties with Nepal. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed anguish and called for peace, chairing an emergency security meeting. Given Nepal's strategic location and the large Nepali diaspora in India, Delhi must carefully navigate the situation amidst accusations of meddling from both India and China.</p>

The dispute between Birmingham City Council and the Unite union continues, leaving citizens feeling neglected and frustrated by the impact on their quality of life and the city's reputation. Despite council tax rises, many residents report unhygienic conditions and a lack of resolution, with the walkout extended until next March.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett visited Southern California for a book event at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, a day after joining a conservative majority in a controversial ruling. The decision cleared federal agents to detain individuals based on appearance in Southern California, sparking outrage over potential Fourth Amendment violations. Barrett's appearance drew admirers who align with her conservative and Christian values, many crediting her for overturning Roe v. Wade. While she avoided direct discussion of the ruling, she offered hypotheticals mirroring the decision and spoke broadly about constitutional interpretation, particularly the "unreasonable" clause of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
