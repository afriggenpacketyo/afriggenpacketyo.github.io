          <p>The U.S. has urged Israel to conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Saif Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American from Florida. Musallet was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers while visiting family in the occupied West Bank. His family stated he was attacked while protecting his land, and that an ambulance was blocked from reaching him for hours. This incident occurs amid a documented rise in settler violence against Palestinians, prompting calls for accountability and protection for civilians in the region from international bodies.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has refuted viral social media claims that large numbers of wildlife are fleeing Yellowstone National Park, stating the videos are likely AI-generated and false. Wildlife experts confirm that animal movements are normal for the season and there is no mass migration underway. The rumors, which some users linked to a potential supervolcano eruption, have been dismissed by geologists who note the volcano's alert level remains "normal." Officials expressed concern that such misinformation can undermine public understanding of natural ecological processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had previously held up the measures due to concerns about a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received necessary guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions, which require unanimous approval, target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including its Nordstream pipelines.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man, Raymond Boodarian, has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of residential burglary for the killings of "American Idol" executive Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was found shot to death in their Encino, California, home after returning from the grocery store. Investigators believe the suspect gained entry through an unlocked door, leading to a fatal confrontation. Boodarian was identified using security footage and facial recognition software and is being held without bail pending a decision on whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is moving forward with a vote on a legislative package to rescind approximately $9 billion in government spending, a key request from the Trump administration. The bill, already passed by the Senate in a slightly smaller version, targets about $8 billion in foreign aid and $1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The measure faced some opposition from Republican senators concerned about its impact on specific programs, such as global AIDS prevention and rural radio stations. The House faces a Friday deadline to pass the bill before the funds are mandated to be spent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild leg swelling. Medical experts describe CVI as a common circulatory condition, affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population, where damaged veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart. This can lead to symptoms like varicose veins, swelling, and in severe cases, skin discoloration or ulcers. Treatment is typically non-surgical, focusing on compression stockings, exercise like walking to strengthen calf muscles, and lifestyle changes to manage the benign condition.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the "unlawful" termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The lawsuit argues that the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA overstepped their authority by shutting down the congressionally funded program, which provides funds for projects to mitigate natural disaster risks. The states claim the shutdown jeopardizes critical infrastructure projects and leaves communities more vulnerable. A CBS News analysis noted that two-thirds of the counties losing funding from the program's termination had voted for President Trump in 2024.</p>

          <p>Amazon is continuing its workforce reduction with a new round of layoffs, this time affecting some employees in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division. The company confirmed the cuts are part of an ongoing review of organizational priorities, not primarily driven by its investments in artificial intelligence. While the exact number of affected employees was not disclosed, a memo indicated the training and certification unit was among those impacted. This move follows more than 27,000 job cuts across the company since 2022 as CEO Andy Jassy pursues a broad cost-cutting strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans' plan to vote on a $9 billion spending cuts package requested by Donald Trump has been complicated by internal party tensions over the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats on the House Rules Committee have leveraged the controversy, forcing votes on amendments to release the Epstein documents, which puts some Republicans in a difficult political position. The issue has created a rift within the GOP, as many of President Trump's supporters demand full transparency while the president has dismissed the controversy as a "hoax." The procedural delays threaten a Friday deadline to pass the bill.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth compounds to China increased threefold compared to the previous year, according to a new report from the China-Brazil Business Council. While the absolute value remains small, this surge is seen as evidence of China's strategy to diversify its sources for strategic minerals. The shift occurs as overall trade patterns between the two nations are changing, with Brazil's trade surplus with China shrinking significantly. Analysts suggest that growing trade barriers between the U.S. and China may be causing supply chains to be rerouted through emerging economies like Brazil.</p>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a "mistake" and said an investigation is underway, affirming a commitment to protect civilians and holy sites. An initial inquiry by the Israel Defense Forces suggested that fragments from a shell fired during operational activity in the area mistakenly hit the church.

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that her recent song "Heterocomía" was a cathartic project, even though it is unlikely to be profitable. To create the track's introduction, she brokered an expensive deal with Disney to sample the theme from the 1970 film "The Aristocats." The song's lyrics, which transition from a whimsical opening to a tale of deception, are widely speculated by fans to be about her past relationship with a billionaire heir known for having heterochromia. While Belinda has not confirmed the rumors, she stated the artistic result was worth the cost, suggesting the "sweet revenge" was more valuable than royalties.</p>

He argues that Democrats must play hardball as Republicans are "playing by a different set of rules."

          <p>Universities like Columbia and Harvard are responding to campus anti-Semitism by implementing measures that mirror the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) frameworks of the past decade. These steps include appointing new Title VI coordinators, launching new training programs, and adopting the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism for disciplinary proceedings. This approach is ironic, as it comes under pressure from the Trump administration, which is simultaneously working to dismantle DEI initiatives nationwide. Critics question the effectiveness of these bureaucratic solutions and worry they could lead to overreach and stifle free expression, similar to criticisms leveled against DEI programs.</p>
