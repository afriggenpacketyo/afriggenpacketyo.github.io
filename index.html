          <p>Bitcoin's value increased by approximately 2% on Friday, bringing it to within 1% of its record high of over $124,000. This rally is attributed to investors seeking safe-haven assets as the U.S. government shutdown continues. The cryptocurrency has seen a 12% surge this week alone, reflecting a growing correlation with U.S. government financial risks. Analysts from Standard Chartered note that this reaction is different from previous shutdowns, suggesting Bitcoin's evolving role in the market and predicting it could soon reach a new high of $135,000.

          <p>Director Lou Ye's latest work, 'An Unfinished Film,' captures the experience of a film crew quarantined near Wuhan during the initial COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. The semi-documentary feature has received international acclaim, not for its artistic complexity, but for its courageous portrayal of a sensitive period in recent Chinese history. While censored in mainland China, it won Best Director at Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards. The article critiques the film for avoiding the mass casualties that followed the end of 'zero-COVID' policies, suggesting it is an essential but incomplete examination of the nation's unprocessed trauma.</p>

          <p>Opinion polls indicate that the right-wing populist ANO party, led by billionaire former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, is leading in the Czech Republic's parliamentary election with over 30% of the vote. Babis, a self-described "Trumpist," has campaigned on a "Czech first" platform and opposes continued military aid to Ukraine. His potential victory raises concerns within the EU, as it could align the country with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging Brussels' policies and sanctions against Russia. A coalition with the far-right SPD party is considered a likely outcome if ANO fails to secure an outright majority.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, making her poised to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative and hawkish views on China. Her election comes after the LDP suffered significant election losses, prompting the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Takaichi's leadership is seen as an attempt to win back conservative voters, though she faces the challenge of uniting a fractured party and addressing significant economic and diplomatic issues.</p>

          <p>Rail operator Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for health and safety breaches leading to the death of Bethan Roper, 28, in December 2018. Roper suffered a fatal head injury after leaning out of a droplight window and striking a tree branch near Bath. The Office of Rail and Road prosecuted GWR for failing to implement risk-reduction measures that had been identified two months prior to the incident. The tragedy, which echoed a similar death in 2016, has since led to industry-wide changes, including the withdrawal or modification of trains with such windows.</p>

          <p>With one month until Election Day 2025, gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia are drawing national attention as key indicators of President Trump's political influence and second-term agenda. These contests, along with a California redistricting proposition and state Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania, are seen as barometers for the 2026 midterms. The ongoing federal government shutdown and Trump's policies, such as those from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are central themes on the campaign trail. Candidates are actively debating blame for the shutdown and linking their opponents to the president's controversial agenda.</p>

          <p>Analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon has revealed a significant temperature difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A team of scientists in China and Britain, studying samples from the Chang'e-6 mission, found that minerals from the far side likely formed in lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This discovery provides new insights into the moon's thermal asymmetry and its geological evolution. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, help explain the long-observed stark contrasts in topography and volcanic activity between the two lunar faces.</p>

In a farewell note, Ben'Ary stated his termination appeared to be based on a single false social media post linking him to a former Biden administration official involved in the January 6 investigation. He expressed concern that leadership is more focused on punishing perceived political enemies than on national security. His abrupt removal disrupts important cases, including the prosecution of a suspect in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.</p>

These individuals often ask laudatory or softball questions, which critics argue serves to protect the president from accountability and emulates tactics used by authoritarian leaders. The White House now selects the reporter pool for Oval Office press conferences, frequently including fringe right-wing voices while excluding some mainstream agencies. This change allows the administration to blunt the momentum of tough questioning by turning to known allies in the room.</p>

The piece refutes claims that Bad Bunny is "un-American" for singing in Spanish, highlighting that language is not a criterion for citizenship.

The request is controversial, as the FAIR Plan faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its handling of smoke damage claims from recent wildfires.

          <p>An 81-year-old Manchester United season ticket holder, Michael Carney, has seen the cost of his seat double to £840 after being relocated to make way for a new corporate zone. Carney, who had sat in the same spot since 1980, was moved as part of minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe's efforts to increase club revenues and cut financial losses. The changes, which included reducing the discount for pensioners, have left long-time fans feeling alienated. Carney expressed his heartbreak over the current state of the club, stating that the soul is gone and it has become all about business and money.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering minting a new one-dollar coin featuring President Donald Trump to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him after his 2024 near-assassination on the other, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The proposal is possible due to the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump, which allows for special designs for the semiquincentennial. However, the move could face legal challenges, as federal law generally prohibits living persons from appearing on U.S. currency and securities.</p>

The disruption on Friday evening affected approximately 6,500 passengers and caused at least 17 flights to be grounded. This incident is the latest in a series of drone-related disruptions at European airports, prompting discussions among EU leaders about creating a multi-layered "drone wall" for detection and defense.

          <p>Italian researchers have proposed a new theory that Venice's famous bronze Lion of St. Mark may have originated as a tomb guardian from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). A study published in the journal Antiquity combines stylistic analysis with lead isotope testing to support the claim. The researchers note similarities between the lion and mythical zhenmushou beasts, and chemical analysis traces the copper to ore sources in China's Lower Yangtze River basin. They speculate that the statue could have been transported to Venice by the father and uncle of explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form.</p>

Despite the area's strong support for Trump, many low-income residents now fear losing access to essential healthcare and food, with some expressing that the cuts will be a matter of life and death.

          <p>The aviation industry is struggling to meet new mandates for the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), a critical component of its plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. While the UK and EU now require 2% of jet fuel to be sustainable, some airline executives, like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, are skeptical that future targets of 6-10% by 2030 can be met due to limited production and high costs. Challenges include Shell halting a major biofuel plant and the US rolling back SAF incentives. Despite these hurdles, some investors and major airlines remain committed, viewing SAF as the only viable path to decarbonization.</p>

This trend was evident in recent municipal elections where the AfD dominated integration councils in cities with large Russia German populations.
