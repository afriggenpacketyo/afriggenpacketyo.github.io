          <p>Five police officers were shot during an incident in York County, Pennsylvania, with several reported to be in critical condition. The event prompted a significant law enforcement response, including from Governor Josh Shapiro and the state's Attorney General, who both traveled to the scene. The suspected gunman reportedly died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a local hospital was placed on lockdown while treating individuals injured in the confrontation. The incident occurred in a rural area, leading to temporary shelter-in-place orders for nearby schools as a precaution.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit, a landmark £150 billion investment package from the United States into the United Kingdom was announced, a deal the UK government claims is the largest of its kind. A significant portion, £90 billion, will come from the asset manager Blackstone over the next decade, with additional funds from companies like Prologis and Palantir. The investment is expected to create over 7,600 jobs across various sectors, including life sciences, defense, and clean energy. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a testament to Britain's economic strength and a key deliverable of the state visit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and announced it was refocusing on guest experience following a public backlash. The controversy stemmed from a recent attempt to modernize its brand, which included a new, simpler logo that critics called "soulless" and disconnected from its American identity. After significant criticism from customers and even a comment from President Trump, the company reversed the decision, reinstating its classic "Old Timer" logo and suspending restaurant remodels. CEO Julie Masino stated the company learned from the passionate customer feedback and is now working to lean into the brand's nostalgic appeal.</p>

          <p>During a state dinner at Windsor Castle, President Donald Trump delivered a toast celebrating the "special relationship" between the United States and the United Kingdom. He invoked Winston Churchill and emphasized shared ties of history, culture, and language between the two nations. In his remarks, Trump also praised the British Empire for laying the foundations of free speech and individual rights, a comment that comes amid ongoing debates and criticisms regarding the UK's current online safety laws and free speech protections. The speech maintained a largely neutral tone on partisan issues, focusing on historical bonds while subtly touching on contemporary political discourse.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, lowering its benchmark rate to a target range of 4%-4.25% to address economic risks. The central bank's projections, known as the "dot plot," indicate the possibility of two additional cuts this year, followed by one in 2026 and another in 2027, aiming for a neutral rate around 3%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management" cut, creating some market uncertainty with its mix of near-term dovishness and long-term hawkishness.

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company, citing ongoing disputes with its parent company, Unilever. In a public letter, Greenfield stated that Unilever has silenced the ice cream brand's progressive social mission and activism for fear of corporate backlash. This move follows years of tension over the company's independence, which was meant to be preserved by an independent board established in the 2000 merger agreement. Greenfield and co-founder Ben Cohen have been campaigning for Unilever to sell the company to a "socially-aligned owner" to allow the brand to continue its legacy of advocacy.</p>

          <p>Former CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee that she was fired for refusing to comply with Health Secretary Robert F.

Monarez stated that Kennedy called the CDC "the most corrupt federal agency" and accused its employees of being "bought by the pharmaceutical industry." She and another official, Dr. Houry, raised concerns that Kennedy's agenda politicizes the agency and risks weakening vaccine protections, potentially leading to the return of preventable diseases.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that Democrats risk being blamed for a government shutdown if they insist on including an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits in the stopgap funding bill. With government funding set to expire on September 30, House Republicans released a bill that omits the extension, which prevents significant health insurance premium increases for millions. Johnson argued that the ACA subsidies are a "December policy debate," not a September funding issue, and accused Democrats of inserting unrelated partisan matters. The standoff creates a high-stakes political battle, as a prolonged shutdown could negatively impact the economy and consumer sentiment.</p>

          <p>In a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Republicans voted to table a motion by Democrats to subpoena four major banks over their financial dealings with Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, led by Representative Jamie Raskin, sought records from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, and BNY Mellon, which reportedly flagged $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions connected to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking operations. Despite bipartisan calls for transparency regarding Epstein's network, the Republican majority blocked the immediate subpoena effort. The move came during a contentious hearing with FBI Director Kash Patel, whom Democrats criticized for not releasing all government files on Epstein.</p>

He contrasted his lack of dialogue with Trump to his relationships with other world leaders, asserting that Trump's connection is with former president Jair Bolsonaro, not with Brazil itself, and that the U.S. president is not the "emperor of the world."</p>

          <p>Recent tax legislation, including the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is fundamentally altering the U.S. tax code by creating targeted carve-outs and loopholes rather than broad-based changes. The new laws benefit not only the wealthiest Americans through extensions of the 2017 tax cuts but also specific working-class professions like waiters, truck drivers, and influencers, who can now deduct gratuity or benefit from overtime tax exemptions. This shift is creating a system of "horizontal inequity," where people with similar incomes face vastly different tax burdens based on their occupation or how they structure their earnings. The result is a more complex, gamed system that shrinks the overall tax base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the financial and HR software company Workday Inc. increased by 7% following the announcement that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has taken a $2 billion stake in the firm. Elliott expressed support for Workday's multi-year plan to improve its operating model and capital allocation, stating it believes the strategy will create "substantial long-term value." The investment provides a vote of confidence in Workday's leadership and its position as a growing software franchise.

          <h2>Study Suggests Vitamin B3 Supplements May Reduce Risk of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Dermatology suggests that taking nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is linked to a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers in people with a prior history of the disease. The research, involving nearly 34,000 veterans, found the most significant benefit among those who started taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis, showing a 54% lower risk of recurrence. Dermatologists say this provides stronger evidence for recommending the widely available, over-the-counter supplement as a secondary prevention measure. The study focused on basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, but did not evaluate B3's effect on melanoma.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a World War I-era fishing boat that sank in a storm nearly a century ago. The vessel disappeared in January 1929 with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. The salvage company Atlantic Wreck Salvage located the site in 2022 and confirmed its identity on a recent dive by matching distinctive features like its winch and steam engine with historical records. The discovery brings a "bittersweet" sense of closure, and the company is encouraging descendants of the lost crew to make contact.</p>

          <p>In his first policy meeting, newly confirmed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter in the central bank's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Miran, an economic adviser to President Trump, voted for a more aggressive half-point reduction, aligning with the White House's calls for more significant easing of monetary policy. The dissent highlights the political tensions surrounding the Fed, as other governors who had previously dissented, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted with the consensus this time. Miran's vote signals a clear dovish stance that is notably different from the more cautious approach of his colleagues. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of homeowners insurance has risen dramatically across the United States, with average premiums increasing by nearly 70% over the last five years. According to new data, factors driving the surge include the rising frequency of climate-related disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, along with increased costs for building materials and higher home values. The sharp price hikes are forcing some homeowners to switch insurers or, in some risky cases, forgo coverage entirely. Experts note that these rising costs are squeezing household budgets and changing public perception of the insurance industry, with consumers questioning the balance between insurer profits and customer welfare.

          <p>A discussion with historian Kyle Harper highlights the growing threat of preventable infectious diseases, such as measles, which are re-emerging in the United States after being eradicated. This resurgence is fueled by a combination of public mistrust in scientific institutions, widespread misinformation, and deep political polarization that has politicized public health measures like vaccination. Harper explains that while humanity has made incredible strides in increasing life expectancy by controlling disease, these gains are fragile. The conversation warns that the current social and political climate is undermining the very institutions, like the CDC and NIH, that are essential for preparing for and responding to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>The stock market reacted with uncertainty following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Major indices like the S&P 500 fluctuated between gains and losses as investors processed the Fed's statement, its economic projections, and comments from Chair Jerome Powell. While the rate cut was expected, the central bank's accompanying message about rising downside risks to employment created a mixed signal. The bond market also saw notable movement, with the 10-year Treasury yield rallying, which put pressure on rate-sensitive sectors like housing. The market's choppy performance reflects the difficulty in interpreting the Fed's path forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish police have arrested 19 individuals on suspicion of murder, torture, and other charges after more than 50 people went missing from a migrant boat traveling from Senegal to the Canary Islands. Survivors reported that during the perilous journey, some passengers attacked others, accusing them of being "witches" responsible for the boat's engine failure and other misfortunes. Victims were allegedly beaten, thrown overboard alive, or denied rescue if they fell into the sea. The vessel, which originally carried around 300 people, was rescued with 248 survivors. The suspects are now in pretrial detention as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Supervisor Joel Engardio has been recalled from office after championing a controversial project to permanently close a section of the Great Highway to create a coastal park. While the measure passed citywide, it was unpopular in his district, where residents raised concerns about traffic and quality of life impacts. Engardio conceded defeat but stood by his decision, stating the park is a success that will become a beloved city feature. The recall, fueled by some of the same organizers behind previous ousters of progressive officials, highlights ongoing tensions in San Francisco politics, particularly around transportation, housing, and constituent responsiveness.</p>
