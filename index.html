          <p>Despite a renewed escalation in trade tensions, including the imposition of retaliatory port fees, Beijing and Washington held working-level discussions on Monday, as confirmed by China’s Ministry of Commerce. The ministry urged the United States to demonstrate sincerity for dialogue, emphasizing that engaging in discussions while simultaneously intimidating and threatening new restrictions is not the appropriate way to manage bilateral relations. Communication between the two global economic powers is maintained through an established bilateral economic and trade consultation mechanism, highlighting a persistent, albeit challenging, effort to address complex trade disputes. These ongoing engagements underscore the delicate balance between diplomatic outreach and economic pressures, reflecting the intricate dynamics of the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed legislation aimed at phasing out perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly known as "forever chemicals," from various consumer products, including nonstick cookware and children's items. Newsom cited deep concerns about the bill's potential impact on the availability of affordable cooking products and the dramatic market shift it would cause. While acknowledging the bill's intention to protect public health from chemicals linked to adverse effects, the governor urged a more careful consideration of economic consequences. The bill's author plans to continue working on the issue, highlighting the ongoing complex debate between environmental health and economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Newly released records reveal that the parents of Joshua Jahn, the 29-year-old gunman in the Dallas ICE facility shooting, informed police their son believed he suffered from "radiation sickness" and was "allergic to plastic." Jahn, who killed two detainees and wounded another before taking his own life, had become a "loner" obsessed with artificial intelligence after moving back from Washington state. His parents also disclosed he had recently purchased a rifle and practiced shooting, though he was not diagnosed with or treated for any mental disorders. The FBI's investigation continues to uncover the complex motivations behind the tragic September 24 attack.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crash in Huntington Beach, Southern California, resulted in five hospitalizations, including a child, on Saturday afternoon. The incident occurred near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, with both occupants of the helicopter and three pedestrians on the street sustaining injuries. Dramatic video footage captured the helicopter spinning multiple times before it plummeted into palm trees and the outdoor stairway of a pedestrian bridge. Federal authorities, including the FAA and NTSB, have been notified and are investigating the cause of the crash, which took place near a planned helicopter landing event.</p>

          <p>China has announced the mass production of the world’s first ultra-low noise, four-channel single-photon detector, dubbed the “photon catcher,” marking a significant technological leap. This advanced device can detect individual photons, making it a critical core component for cutting-edge technologies like quantum communication and quantum radar. Its powerful applications are expected to range from enhancing daily communications to bolstering national defense, specifically for detecting and tracking stealth aircraft such as the F-22. This development signifies a major advancement in quantum technology capabilities, potentially reshaping military and technological landscapes.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced apprehension regarding Monday's market rally, attributing it to an excessive number of speculative stocks rather than established market leaders. He noted that while major indexes recouped some losses from Friday's sell-off, the most significant gains were seen in volatile, speculative names, particularly in the nuclear power and quantum computing sectors. Cramer warned that such speculative leadership creates market froth and is less encouraging than rallies driven by proven companies like the "Magnificent Seven." His analysis suggests caution despite the overall market rebound, highlighting potential instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>L.A.-based musician, composer, and artist San Cha is premiering her experimental opera, "Inebria me," at REDCAT, expanding on her critically acclaimed 2019 album "La Luz de la Esperanza." The 90-minute work fuses ranchera music with electronic and disco elements, using a queer lens to upend traditional telenovela narratives. San Cha, who grew up immersed in telenovelas and intense Bible study, explores themes of sin, guilt, and freedom through the story of Dolores and a genderless spirit. The opera reflects her unique artistic synthesis and collaborative approach, bringing a fresh and thought-provoking perspective to the stage.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly called for federal troops to address crime in San Francisco, characterizing downtown as a "drug zombie apocalypse" on his social network X. His comments follow Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's initial openness to federal intervention, which he later softened, emphasizing local leadership responsibility for public safety. Local officials, including San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins and Mayor Daniel Lurie, strongly oppose federal deployment, citing recent improvements in crime rates and tent encampments. This debate highlights differing views on effective public safety solutions and the city's image, particularly during Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference.</p>

          <p>The UK government's National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) is urging chief executives to prepare for potential cyber-attacks by having physical or offline copies of their operational plans. This critical advice follows a significant increase in "nationally significant" cyber incidents, which have caused chaos for major companies like Marks and Spencer and Jaguar Land Rover. The NCSC advocates for "resilience engineering" to ensure organizations can continue operating and rebuild IT systems even if attacked, rather than solely relying on prevention. This proactive measure aims to mitigate the growing threat of financially motivated and state-sponsored cybercrime, emphasizing preparedness over solely defensive strategies.</p>

          <p>A government scheme in the UK, aimed at cutting energy use by insulating homes, has resulted in widespread failures, leaving tens of thousands of properties in need of remedial work. The National Audit Office (NAO) found that 98% of external wall insulation installations and nearly a third of internal installations had problems, potentially leading to damp and mold. Failures were attributed to an "under-skilled workforce," businesses cutting corners, and insufficient oversight by the TrustMark consumer protection scheme. The government has pledged to fix affected homes at no cost to consumers, acknowledging "unacceptable, systemic failings" and promising comprehensive reforms.</p>

The loss, following a previous 4-3 defeat to Belgium and a friendly loss to England, intensifies scrutiny on Bellamy's coaching and tactical choices.

While current analysis is a snapshot, it suggests the SNP could achieve a near majority in Holyrood, an extraordinary feat for a party nearing its third consecutive decade in devolved power. This resurgence fuels their argument for another independence referendum, despite the UK government's firm opposition, highlighting Scotland's deeply divided constitutional question.</p>

It also extends the claim filing period to at least 100 days, up from two months.

Cameron's "Pulse of Life" campaign has already led to his school introducing the life-saving training and has garnered significant attention from Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs).
