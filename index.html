          <p>A BBC investigation highlights cases where dopamine agonist drugs, prescribed for Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome, have caused extreme behavioral changes. The article details instances of compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and coercive behavior, which have devastated families. Despite long-known risks, many patients report not being adequately warned by doctors about these potential side effects. The report also raises concerns about the pharmaceutical industry's influence on studies and the vagueness of current medication warnings.</p>

          <p>A labor dispute involving Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, has led to striking garbage collectors in several US cities, including Boston and its suburbs. The Teamsters union is demanding better pay and benefits, citing the high cost of living, while the company accuses the union of preferring chaos over compromise. The strike has resulted in overflowing trash, foul odors, and public health concerns, forcing municipalities to take costly alternative measures. While some local disputes have been resolved, others remain at a stalemate with no new negotiations scheduled.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that one of two grenades recovered from a Santa Monica garage is now missing following a tragic explosion that killed three deputies. The blast occurred at a training facility after the deputies, believing the devices were inert, held them overnight. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the ATF are leading a search for the second grenade, urging the public not to touch any explosive device they might find. The department has also revised its policies to treat all explosive devices as live in the future.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to dismiss all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, according to a source familiar with the plan. This independent panel is responsible for recommending which preventive services, like cancer screenings, should be covered by insurance. The source indicated that Kennedy views the group as being too "woke." An HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made, but the move signals a potential major shift in public health policy and insurance coverage mandates.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. This gigawatt-level facility, which is now awaiting final approval, is expected to be operational after 2030. The development places China among other major nuclear powers like Russia and the U.S. that are also pursuing advanced reactor technologies. These next-generation reactors aim to provide a more fuel-efficient and sustainable source of power, marking a key milestone for the country's energy future.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents were illegal and thwarted enforcement efforts. In her ruling, the judge stated the policies do not improperly regulate federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, affirming their commitment to policies they say support public safety by focusing local police on local needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history when entertainment professionals were ostracized for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," writers and directors who were imprisoned for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. It showcases personal artifacts and explores how the anti-Communist fervor expanded, ruining careers and forcing many to name names to save themselves. The exhibit serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers of political persecution and its impact on free speech.</p>

          <p>This article explores Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it as more than just a pastime but a core part of his business and political identity. The sport serves as a venue for fierce competition, high-level networking, and quiet diplomacy, from forging a bond with former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discussing global security with Finland's president. While his passion for the game is clear, his golf ventures are also business assets, and a round with him is seen as a transactional opportunity for access and influence, away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of "proffer immunity" for her recent two-day, nine-hour interview with the Deputy Attorney General. This legal protection allowed her to answer questions freely without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed she answered all questions, which reportedly covered about 100 different people, but stated no promises of clemency were made. The high-level meeting is unusual and comes as the Justice Department faces pressure to provide more transparency on the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a critical mission to rescue the state's desert bighorn sheep, whose population has been decimated by disease. After losing about half the population in five years, experts captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd. These animals were airlifted, checked by veterinarians, and relocated to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, healthy colony. A recent visit revealed the effort is succeeding, with the relocated herd surviving and even producing new lambs, offering hope for the species' future.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with President Trump's special envoy stating that Hamas's response showed a "lack of desire" to reach a deal. The talks are deadlocked over conflicting demands regarding a full Israeli withdrawal and the release of all hostages. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis deepens, with the United Nations and other aid agencies reporting that children are starving to death due to the blockade and obstacles to aid distribution. UNICEF noted a 180% increase in acute malnourishment among children since February, underscoring the catastrophic human toll of the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a rapid descent shortly after takeoff, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the dramatic maneuver. The airline confirmed the crew was responding to onboard traffic alerts, and flight data suggests the Boeing 737 had to dive to avoid a potential collision with a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The flight landed safely in Las Vegas, but the incident is now under investigation by the FAA, marking another recent near-miss in U.S. airspace.</p>

          <p>This article explores the validity of popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. Experts suggest that while these targets are useful guidelines, there is often room for flexibility based on individual needs and lifestyles. For instance, thirst is a reliable indicator for hydration for most healthy people, but the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep is less negotiable for long-term health. The consensus is that while benchmarks are helpful, a balanced, consistent approach to overall well-being is more important than rigidly hitting every number.</p>

The article also delves into why female athletes have a higher risk for certain injuries, like ACL tears, and how anatomy, hormones, and quality of training all play a role.

          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify and aid experts of the food boxes being distributed in Gaza by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised nutritional concerns. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, chickpeas, and flour, may provide enough calories for short-term survival, experts warn they lack essential vitamins and minerals. Prolonged consumption could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy. The aid is also deficient in foods suitable for young children, and the dried goods require scarce water and fuel for preparation.</p>
