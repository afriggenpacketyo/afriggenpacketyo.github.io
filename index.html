          <p>Google introduced AI Mode, a new artificial intelligence feature designed to provide users with more detailed and tailored responses to search queries, at its annual Google I/O developer conference. CEO Sundar Pichai described AI Mode as a "total reimagining of Search" that will gradually roll out to all Google users. The technology summarizes information from multiple sources and presents it alongside links to relevant sites. While Google anticipates increased user satisfaction, concerns remain about potential inaccuracies and the impact on website traffic, given the possibility that AI-generated summaries may reduce the need to click on source links.

          <p>Stocks experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 817 points, as bond yields surged amid concerns about the national debt and the potential economic impact of a proposed tax cut bill. The sell-off coincided with the 10-year Treasury yield reaching its highest level since February, fueled by a Congressional Budget Office report projecting a substantial increase in the national debt due to the tax policies. Rising interest rates resulting from the bond selloff could lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing down economic growth. (optimism_score: 35)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration's plan for a multilayered missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome for America," which aims to protect the U.S. from foreign missile threats. The system would incorporate space-based sensors and interceptors to detect and destroy missiles before launch, during flight, and upon approach. China has criticized the plan, stating that it could lead to the militarization of space and a global arms race. The initiative, still in the conceptual stage, would involve multiple American defense and technology companies and could cost hundreds of billions of dollars. (optimism_score: 60)</p>
