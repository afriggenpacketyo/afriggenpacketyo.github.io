            <p>Technology stocks experienced a significant downturn, reversing earlier gains as optimism surrounding potential tariff negotiations waned. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw a substantial drop, with major players like Apple and Tesla falling considerably. Market hopes for tariff reductions faded due to worries that negotiations would fail before reciprocal tariffs take effect. This market turbulence follows President Trump's tariff plans, which have triggered volatility in recent trading sessions, leading to substantial market value losses for major tech companies.

            <p>A tech analyst has responded to President Trump's suggestion that Apple could manufacture iPhones in the U.S. to avoid tariffs. The analyst, Laura Martin, believes it is unlikely due to the high costs associated with U.S. production. Martin estimates that Apple's costs would significantly increase, and the process of moving the supply chain would take years. Other analysts have echoed these concerns, with some estimating the cost of a U.S.-made iPhone at $3,500. (not investment advice)</p>
