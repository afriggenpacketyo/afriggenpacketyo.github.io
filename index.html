          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) training programs at community colleges, designed to prepare workers for jobs in the growing EV industry, face an uncertain future due to policy changes implemented by the Trump administration. The cancellation of tax credits for EVs and the rollback of pollution regulations threaten to reduce demand for electric vehicles, potentially jeopardizing investments in training programs and jobs in the sector. Despite the uncertainty, some local leaders and educators remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the EV industry. (no investment advice)</p>
