        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cieran Slicker had a rough debut for Scotland amid a goalkeeping injury crisis, leaving manager Steve Clarke with limited options. With several keepers out injured, Robby McCrorie's warm-up injury compounded the problem. Former Scotland defender Willie Miller emphasized the need to assess Slicker's mindset before potentially putting him back in the firing line. Clarke might consider Jon McLaughlin, a seasoned player, or look at other Scottish-based options like Scott Bain or Ross Doohan as potential replacements for upcoming friendlies, navigating a challenging situation to find a reliable option in goal. The team is trying to find a stable footing despite the adversity. </p>

          <p>Visitors attending the UK-wide Open Farm Sunday are being warned about the risk of cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic infection causing gastrointestinal illness. There were 17 outbreaks linked to farms in England and Wales in 2024, with a recent outbreak in south Wales affecting dozens. Inspection reports reveal some farms repeatedly ignored health advice, allowing children to handle sick animals in unsanitary conditions. Open Farm Sunday organizers maintain high health and safety standards, but concerns remain about a small number of farms failing to meet necessary hygiene requirements and endangering visitors. This serves as a reminder to wash your hands. </p>

          <p>Reform UK is facing difficulties in forming coalitions in local councils despite gains in recent elections. The party's focus on national issues like immigration, rather than local policy, has made cooperation with established parties challenging. In Cornwall, other parties refused to work with Reform UK, leading to a Lib Dem-independent coalition. Reform UK's uncompromising stance and lack of local policy platforms have hindered its ability to participate in formal coalitions, leaving the party navigating minority administrations and potential deal-making on key decisions. The party is navigating the political landscape after making gains.</p>

          <p>Welsh rarebit, a popular Welsh dish, has varied origin stories, including being a joke by the English. Some believe it was a substitute for meat by poor farmers, while others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Food historian Carwyn Graves connects rarebit to Welsh cultural identity, with cheese being a vital part of European diets, especially in Wales. Despite different theories, Welsh rarebit remains a beloved comfort food with a rich history and cultural significance, celebrated for its unique flavor and nostalgic appeal.

          <p>During his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump, referring to himself as the "king of debt," promised to eliminate the national debt within eight years.

However, the current national debt stands at over $36.2 trillion, becoming a focal point of criticism for Trump's recent spending package. Elon Musk has publicly criticized the bill, arguing it undermines efforts to cut wasteful spending and drives America into debt slavery, leading to a public feud between the two figures.

Residents expressed a desire for closure, either by finding Madeleine's body or discovering her living with another family. The initial investigation in 2007 failed to preserve the scene, and subsequent investigations yielded no concrete leads until 2020 when German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters claimed to have evidence that Madeleine was dead and identified Christian Brückner as a suspect. The search this week aimed to gather more evidence to charge Brückner, but the case remains unresolved, leaving lingering questions about Madeleine's fate.

          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed members of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) to access sensitive records from the Social Security Administration during ongoing legal challenges. The conservative-majority court sided with the Trump administration, lifting an injunction that restricted Doge's access to the data. Critics, including Justice Jackson, expressed concerns about the lack of privacy safeguards and the potential for misuse of personal information. The lawsuit, brought by labor unions and an advocacy group, aims to block Doge from accessing the databases, citing privacy concerns. The agency has been the focus of attention lately.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting them was unconstitutional, stating that teaching yoga is "protected speech". The court sided with instructors who sued over a law banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks. The city argued the rule was about commercial activity, not yoga, but the court found it violated the instructors' First Amendment rights. Advocates say outdoor yoga provides a service to those with disabilities or who cannot afford classes elsewhere, marking a victory for community access and freedom of expression. The classes are now back in session.</p>
