          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station, deploying a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of vital equipment and provisions. A key feature of this mission is the inclusion of an innovative add-on thruster kit, which will contribute to maintaining the ISS's orbital altitude, a role previously managed predominantly by Russian spacecraft. The cargo also facilitates over 50 new research projects, ranging from studies on microgravity's effect on bone loss to advancements in 3D metal and bioprinting for potential medical applications. This mission underscores ongoing international collaboration and the expansion of the station's operational independence.</p>

The vessel, which had departed from Libya's Zuwara city, began taking on significant amounts of water due to rough seas. A German rescue charity, RESQSHIP, managed to save about 65 other individuals, including the girls' mother and brother, alongside three pregnant women and a seven-month-old baby. Many survivors also sustained severe chemical burns, underscoring the immense risks and inhumane conditions faced by those attempting to reach Europe.</p>

          <p>Former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus voiced strong doubts about the feasibility of peace negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, unequivocally stating that Putin represents the primary "obstacle to peace." Petraeus contended that Putin is unwilling to conclude the conflict without acquiring additional territory. He advocated for the United States to significantly bolster its assistance to Ukraine by removing current weapon restrictions, confiscating $300 billion in frozen Russian reserves, and imposing more stringent sanctions, including targeting Gazprom bank, to decisively shift the conflict's trajectory.</p>

          <p>US sanctions, including the 2019 blacklisting of China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) and recent equipment license suspensions, aimed at curbing China's nuclear power development, have inadvertently proven counterproductive. The article highlights that these stringent measures have paradoxically stimulated China's domestic nuclear industry, leading to advanced capabilities and an "incredible" industrial scale. This unexpected progress, achieved despite US restrictions, now positions China as an efficient benchmark. Consequently, its exclusion from global nuclear cooperation risks stalling atomic energy revival efforts in the US and Europe, which face their own challenges with delays and supply chain weaknesses.</p>

          <p>This article delivers a concerning forecast for the 2026 Social Security Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), predicting it may fail to adequately match inflation, thus further diminishing retirees' purchasing power. Although an increased COLA translates to higher benefits, it typically coincides with periods of rising prices that often become entrenched. A study by the Senior Citizens League indicates that average Social Security benefits in 2024 held only 80 cents of their 2010 purchasing power, illustrating a substantial long-term erosion due to COLAs consistently lagging the true inflation rate. This trend underscores ongoing financial challenges for many retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is initiating a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to rectify "unacceptable delays" and diminish the reliance on hotels for accommodating asylum seekers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the creation of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators, intended to expedite the processing of over 51,000 pending appeal cases. This policy shift responds to mounting public pressure and protests concerning the financial and logistical burdens of housing asylum seekers. However, critics, including the Refugee Council, contend that improving the accuracy of initial decisions is the most efficient method to reduce the appeals backlog, stressing the importance of judicial oversight in such critical cases.</p>
