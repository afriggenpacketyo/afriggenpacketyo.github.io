          <p>This article explores the often-overlooked costs associated with collection debt, which extend beyond the initial balance to include accruing interest, collection agency fees, potential legal costs, and long-term damage to credit scores. The piece emphasizes that unpaid collection debt can rapidly escalate due to these added expenses, making it increasingly difficult to manage over time. It advises individuals to negotiate settlements directly with collection agencies, request fee waivers, seek professional debt relief assistance, and consider available legal options, such as expired statutes of limitations, to reduce the overall financial burden. It is important to take proactive steps to rebuild financial health and address collection debt promptly, as the costs continue to accumulate the longer one waits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the Trump administration's attempts to minimize the focus on the nation's racial past, particularly in cultural institutions dedicated to Black history. The article highlights the initial rescinding and subsequent restoration of federal grants to the Whitney Plantation in Louisiana, a site focused on portraying the realities of slavery. Ashley Rogers, the plantation's executive director, criticized the administration's use of the phrase "improper ideology" as Orwellian, emphasizing the importance of presenting historical facts accurately. The article also notes the ongoing debate surrounding the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, reflecting broader tensions over how American history is interpreted and presented. This is taking place as the country is still reckoning with the effects of the murder of George Floyd.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people of the Peruvian Andes engaged in exclusive rituals involving psychoactive drugs. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which contained traces of DMT, a powerful hallucinogenic substance, and tobacco plants. The study indicates that these rituals, likely restricted to elite members of Chav√≠n society, may have played a role in establishing social and political hierarchies. The findings provide material evidence supporting the theory that hallucinogens were central to the ritual practices of this ancient civilization, considered a predecessor to the Inca civilization.</p>

The film documents the dramatic decline in ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime, largely due to bottom trawling and industrial fishing practices. However, Attenborough remains optimistic, highlighting the ocean's capacity to recover quickly if given the chance. He hopes the film will inspire leaders to take decisive action at an upcoming UN conference, supporting the protection of a third of the world's oceans to enhance carbon dioxide absorption and overall ecosystem health.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is currently facing significant delays and cancellations due to an ongoing air traffic controller shortage, exacerbated by recent equipment failures and adverse weather conditions. The union representing air traffic controllers reports that multiple members are on trauma leave following an incident where communication with pilots was temporarily lost. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to announce a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's air traffic control system.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would cease bombing the Houthis in Yemen, citing assurances from the rebel group that they would stop attacking U.S. ships in the Red Sea.

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit targeting the abortion pill mifepristone, a move that appears to contradict the president's stance on abortion rights. Experts suggest that this action may preserve the administration's ability to potentially restrict mifepristone access through the FDA in the future, while avoiding immediate controversy. By arguing that states lack standing to challenge FDA policy, the administration may be setting the stage to defend future restrictions against challenges from blue states.

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, is planning to shut down a direct communications channel between U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem working on Palestinian issues and agencies in Washington. This move will effectively end the special status of the Office of Palestinian Affairs at the embassy, which had been sending cables to Washington without prior approval from embassy leaders. The decision, made after consultation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signals a shift in how the U.S. government views and handles Palestinian issues, integrating the responsibilities of the Palestinian Affairs office fully into the embassy.</p>

          <p>Travelers who have not yet obtained a REAL ID will still be able to fly after the deadline, but should expect additional identity checks, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Noem stated that a significant majority of travelers already have REAL ID-compliant identification. Those without compliant IDs may be diverted to a different security line. Despite these assurances, many people have experienced long wait times at DMV offices across the country as they rush to obtain a REAL ID before the deadline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the authority to implement its policy barring transgender individuals from serving in the military while legal challenges continue. This decision reverses a lower court order that had blocked the ban nationwide. The policy stems from an executive order targeting active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria, citing concerns about troop readiness and cohesion. While the White House celebrated the ruling, advocacy groups expressed disappointment and reiterated their belief that the policy is discriminatory and unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>California Democratic lawmakers have reached a compromise on a bill that would increase the penalty for soliciting a minor aged 16 or 17 for sexual contact. The legislation, AB 379, will allow prosecutors to file felony charges against adults who solicit sex from a minor who is 16 or 17 years old if the accused is three years older than the minor. The bill will also include a state grant program to help streamline prosecution in human trafficking and sex trafficking cases, and a support fund for survivors, partially funded by increased fines for businesses that ignore or aid in human trafficking.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that some elite law firms are increasingly hesitant to take on pro bono work challenging the Trump administration's policies, fearing retribution from the president. The article cites examples of firms declining to participate in immigration lawsuits and other cases that could be seen as undermining the administration's agenda. This shift represents a significant change from Trump's first term, when many large law firms actively challenged his policies. Public interest groups are now struggling to find legal support as a result of this chilling effect.</p>

The plan involves forcing some or all of Gaza's Palestinian civilians into a small area in the ruins of the south. Aid organizations condemn the plan as a violation of humanitarian principles. The UK and the EU oppose a new Israeli offensive. Netanyahu's critics say prolonging the war is about his political survival, not Israel's safety or the return of its hostages.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House hearing has been triggered by a report detailing suspected Chinese surveillance sites in Cuba, raising concerns about Beijing's expanding intelligence presence near U.S. territory. The hearing focuses on findings from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which identified four suspected signals intelligence facilities, including one near Bejucal that has undergone significant upgrades. These facilities could enhance Cuba's ability to monitor military and commercial activity across the southeastern U.S. The hearing underscores growing concerns about China's intelligence activities and their potential impact on U.S. security.</p>
