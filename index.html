          <p>The Pentagon has redirected the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group from the Indo-Pacific to the Middle East, marking the fourth such maneuver in less than a year. This redeployment comes amid escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran, raising concerns about balancing immediate operational needs in the Middle East with long-term strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. The carrier canceled plans to dock in Vietnam due to an emergent operational requirement, highlighting the increased demands on American military resources in fluctuating and prolonged conflicts. The move has prompted caution in Taiwan, emphasizing the need for the United States to carefully manage its military commitments across different regions. </p>

The defense argued that the case should be dismissed with prejudice, preventing future refiling of charges.

          <p>President Trump suggested a potential "deal" with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll them. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism. Harvard sued, arguing the school was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda. The potential deal comes after Trump issued an order barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard. </p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House passed legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, often referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who has expressed his support for such bans, potentially making Rhode Island the eleventh state with a prohibition on these firearms. The bill only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession, and aims to align Rhode Island with neighboring states on gun control measures. Critics argue that the ban will not curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

          <p>A prosecutor working on the case of Suzanne Morphew, a missing Colorado mother, stated in court that investigators suspect they know the location of her body. The prosecutor described the location as "a very difficult spot" and said the sheriff's office is continuing to search for her remains. Suzanne Morphew disappeared on Mother's Day in 2020, and the case has involved bizarre clues and a lack of direct evidence. Her husband, Barry Morphew, was previously charged with her murder, but the charges were dropped. </p>

          <p>A deadly border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has tested China's neighborhood diplomacy as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in the region. Analysts believe China will monitor the situation closely while avoiding direct mediation, potentially working with ASEAN to prevent future confrontations. The clash, which left one Cambodian soldier dead, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula. This region is crucial for China's trade gateway to Southeast Asia, making stability a priority for Beijing's foreign policy. </p>

          <p>President Trump hinted at potentially firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for his monetary policy decisions, calling him a "Total and Complete Moron." Any attempt to fire Powell would likely be legally contentious, as federal law states that members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors can only be fired "for cause." The Fed's interest rate-setting committee has kept its benchmark rate steady, balancing the need to control inflation with concerns about slowing economic growth. </p>

          <p>Diplomacy is being considered as a "last shot" within the next two weeks to end the Israel-Iran conflict, with President Trump deciding whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva, while the U.S. expressed readiness for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts. There are confidential discussions about potential leaders in Iran and the security of nuclear sites. The situation remains uncertain, with the possibility of military force still on the table. </p>
