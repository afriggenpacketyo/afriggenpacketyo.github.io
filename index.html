        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Saturday, thousands participated in the second "No Kings" day of protest across the United States, organized by a network of progressive groups. Demonstrators voiced opposition to a wide range of Trump administration policies, including immigration tactics and environmental deregulation, under the unifying theme of protecting democracy from perceived monarchical behavior. The largely peaceful events featured diverse forms of expression, from speeches by figures like Senator Bernie Sanders to artistic displays. While Republican leaders criticized the rallies, organizers reported a massive turnout, highlighting a significant and energized movement of public dissent.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians within Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The U.S. State Department has informed other guarantors of the peace deal and stated that protective measures would be taken if the attack proceeds. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed factions as it tries to reassert control in the territory. This development adds significant tension to the fragile truce, which has seen the release of hostages and prisoners.</p>

        </div>

          <p>New media reports allege that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail in 2011 to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. These claims emerge as calls intensify for King Charles III to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, following his recent decision to relinquish other royal and military honors. The pressure on the prince has grown due to his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the impending publication of a posthumous memoir by Ms. Giuffre. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the latest allegations, which the Metropolitan Police are now reviewing.</p>

          <p>A growing number of major companies, including Accenture and Lufthansa, have cited artificial intelligence as a key reason for recent job cuts, fueling employee anxiety about technological displacement. However, some industry critics and academics argue that AI is being used as a convenient excuse to conceal other business challenges, such as over-hiring during the pandemic or general economic slowdowns. Research from institutions like Yale and the New York Fed suggests that widespread, AI-driven job losses have not yet materialized. This article explores the narrative that companies may be "scapegoating" AI to justify difficult restructuring decisions.</p>

          <p>A BBC Scotland investigation, which began nine years ago, played a crucial role in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud that targeted over 3,500 victims. The company, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), used high-pressure tactics to lure elderly timeshare owners, promising to get them out of their contracts but instead selling them useless "credits" and taking their money. The BBC's secret filming of a sales meeting provided key evidence for police, leading to multiple arrests and trials. The successful prosecution brings some closure to the victims as authorities now pursue the assets gained through the crime.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of betting company Betfred, has warned that a potential increase in gambling taxes by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves could force the closure of all 1,287 of its high street shops. Such a move would jeopardize 7,500 jobs and represents the "biggest threat" to the industry in his view. The warning comes as the government considers raising taxes on the sector to fund public services, a proposal supported by think tanks and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The betting industry argues that significant tax hikes would be economically reckless and push customers towards unregulated offshore operators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea is actively pursuing new diplomatic partnerships in Southeast Asia, highlighted by high-level visits from Vietnamese and Laotian leaders for its ruling party's 80th anniversary. The visit by Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary was the first in 18 years, with both nations agreeing to boost cooperation in defense and healthcare. Analysts suggest these relationships provide North Korea with a sense of legitimacy and potential avenues to bypass international sanctions. For Vietnam and Laos, it represents a strengthening of ties with a fellow nominally communist state, though significant economic partnership remains limited due to North Korea's isolation.</p>

The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement that the US had struck a "drug-carrying submarine," part of a series of recent attacks in the Caribbean aimed at stopping narcotics trafficking.

          <p>The 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries is projected to be around 2.7% to 2.8%, marking the fifth consecutive year of increases at or above 2.5%. This adjustment is influenced by ongoing inflation, partially driven by President Trump's tariff policies. However, the increase in benefits is expected to be largely offset by a significant projected rise in Medicare Part B premiums, which could climb by over 11%. Consequently, the purchasing power of Social Security income is likely to decline again for many retirees, continuing a long-term trend of benefits failing to keep pace with key expenses.

At the time, the exclusion was widely seen as a nod to the United Auto Workers union, as Tesla's workforce is not unionized. Harris argues that excluding the nation's leading EV manufacturer didn't make sense and likely alienated Musk, who has since become a major financial backer of Donald Trump.

Current right-backs have not replicated this skill set, forcing midfielders like Florian Wirtz into deeper, less effective roles.

          <p>It is common for sexual frequency and desire to wane in long-term relationships, a phenomenon psychologists attribute to both hormonal changes and evolving relationship dynamics. At the beginning of a relationship, passion is driven by a specific hormonal cocktail, which later gives way to bonding hormones like oxytocin that can dampen sex drive. Experts emphasize that open communication about needs and desires is crucial for navigating this shift. Factors such as the "orgasm gap" in heterosexual relationships, where female pleasure is often not prioritized, can also contribute to a decrease in libido, highlighting the importance of mutual satisfaction.</p>

          <p>As rising temperatures and extreme weather put the United Kingdom's native trees under significant stress, Forestry England has released a list of 30 "species for the future" that are better suited to thrive in a warmer climate. The list includes native trees like oak and birch, as well as non-native species such as the coast redwood and Corsican pine, which are adapted to drier conditions. This initiative aims to create more diverse and resilient woodlands to combat the effects of climate change, which is causing events like "acute oak decline." The strategy reflects a growing interest in assisted migration to help forests adapt.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old woman who has lived in a cottage on the West Horsley Place estate for nearly 20 years is facing eviction. The estate, famously used as the "Button House" location for the hit BBC sitcom "Ghosts," is managed by a charitable trust that plans to convert her home into a holiday rental for fans of the show. The resident, Baschea Walsh, expressed her heartbreak at being forced to leave her community and the home she has lovingly maintained. The trust stated it has provided an extended notice period and assistance in finding alternative housing, highlighting the commercial pressures facing historic properties.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has announced plans to develop a "T-Dome," a multilayered air defense network designed to protect the island's critical infrastructure and population centers from potential missile and drone attacks from mainland China. The proposal, which appears to draw inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome system, aims to leverage advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. However, the announcement has reportedly surprised Taiwan's defense establishment, as the project was not mentioned in the latest National Defence Report, nor is it funded in the upcoming government budget, raising questions about its feasibility.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Sanae Takaichi, is reportedly set to form a new coalition with the right-leaning Japan Innovation Party. This alliance would pave the way for Takaichi to become the nation's first female prime minister. The move follows the recent collapse of the LDP's long-standing coalition with the Komeito party, which had thrown the country into a period of political uncertainty. The new agreement is expected to be formalized soon, with Innovation Party lawmakers supporting Takaichi in the upcoming parliamentary vote for prime minister, stabilizing the government.</p>

          <p>The 20th-ranked USC Trojans suffered a significant blow to their College Football Playoff hopes with a 34-24 loss to Notre Dame in a rain-drenched rivalry game. The Trojans were hampered by critical errors, including two fourth-quarter interceptions and a costly fumble on a failed trick play, which coach Lincoln Riley later called a "stupid call." USC's defense struggled to contain Notre Dame's rushing attack, which amassed 306 yards. With two losses, USC now has no margin for error for the remainder of the season if they are to contend for a national championship spot.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins secured their third consecutive win with a dramatic 20-17 comeback victory against Maryland. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava led a game-tying touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter and, after a brief injury scare, returned to orchestrate a final 35-second drive to set up the game-winning field goal. A key play in the final drive was a 35-yard run by reserve running back Anthony Frias II, who also had a 55-yard touchdown earlier in the game. The victory continues UCLA's midseason resurgence, moving them to a 3-4 record.</p>
