          <p>Palantir's stock has entered bear market territory, dropping 20% from recent highs after its longest losing streak since April 2024. The decline was influenced by a broader market downturn and a critical report from short-seller Citron Research, which argued the company's valuation is detached from its fundamentals. This downturn follows a period of significant growth for the AI software firm, which recently celebrated its first billion-dollar revenue quarter and joined the S&P 500 last year. Despite its success with government contracts, the company's high price-to-earnings ratio continues to raise concerns among investors about its expensive valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Aubrey Plaza has spoken publicly for the first time about the death of her husband, writer-director Jeff Baena, who died by suicide in January. In a podcast conversation with former co-star Amy Poehler, Plaza described her grief as a constant and overwhelming struggle, comparing it to an 'ocean of awfulness.' She shared that she is functioning but faces a daily battle, with some moments being more manageable than others. Plaza and Baena, who married in 2021 after a decade together, had previously kept the details of his death private, asking for respect during the unimaginable tragedy.</p>

          <p>Sony has announced a $50 price increase for all models of its PlayStation 5 console in the United States, effective this week. The entry-level Digital Edition will now cost $500, while the standard model with a disc drive will be priced at $550. This decision comes as companies grapple with a challenging global economic environment, including the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported goods from countries like Japan. While Sony did not explicitly name tariffs as the cause, the move follows similar price hikes by competitors like Microsoft's Xbox and warnings from consumer companies about rising costs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's pause on student loan forgiveness through the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, initiated earlier this summer, remains in effect. Lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders, are urging the Department of Education to resume the legally mandated debt cancellation for borrowers who have completed their required 20-25 years of payments. The department stated the freeze is necessary to correctly calculate payment counts following court decisions that blocked the separate SAVE plan, which had different rules for forbearance periods. This delay primarily affects a smaller group of long-term borrowers who were enrolled in other plans before switching to IBR.</p>

Coming from a family of 'Trekkies,' Gooding has been warmly received by the devoted fanbase for her portrayal of the Starfleet cadet. She explained that to maintain authenticity, she intentionally avoids learning about Uhura's future storylines, as her character would be unaware of what lies ahead. The current season explores Uhura's development as she navigates her responsibilities as an officer and experiences personal moments, including a budding romance, adding new dimensions to the well-known character.</p>

Sources close to the agents suggest they may have been targeted for their involvement in investigations related to Donald Trump or the January 6th Capitol riot. Among those fired were Brian Driscoll, a former acting FBI director, and Steven Jensen, head of the Washington field office, both of whom had been promoted by current Director Kash Patel. The firings are being questioned as potentially stemming from outside political interference, possibly influenced by right-leaning former agents critical of the bureau.</p>

          <p>South African authorities have arrested six individuals, including well-known rhino breeder John Hume, in connection with a major international rhino horn trafficking ring. The arrests followed a seven-year investigation by the elite Hawks police unit into a scheme that allegedly smuggled 964 horns, valued at over $14 million, to markets in Southeast Asia. Hume, the former owner of the world's largest rhino conservation farm, and the other suspects face charges of fraud, theft, and violating biodiversity laws. While domestic trade of rhino horns is legal in South Africa, international export is banned, making this a significant disruption of organized crime.</p>

The letter alleges Cook misrepresented her primary residence on mortgage applications for two different properties in 2021. This development is part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration to influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies and follows similar allegations leveled against other political opponents.</p>

Joslin stated the act was a personal expression of protest against administration policies targeting transgender individuals and a message of safety within national parks. The termination letter cited a failure to demonstrate acceptable conduct, and the park has since tightened rules on demonstrations, prohibiting large banners in wilderness areas. Joslin's legal representatives argue that the firing is unjust, noting that flags have previously been flown from the monolith without such severe consequences.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are reducing traditional search traffic to publishers, they are creating a new, more valuable form of engagement. The author posits that high-value conversations within AI assistants like Google's Gemini, focused on topics such as travel or financial planning, can be monetized at a much higher rate than simple search clicks. This shift could transform Google's business from a per-click model to a per-conversation one. Publishers can also leverage this trend by hosting their own trusted LLM conversations, moving from a pageview-driven model to one based on building valuable user relationships.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has condemned a court's decision to temporarily block a land transfer required for the development of the Resolution Copper mine in Arizona. In a social media post, Trump called the pushback 'anti-American,' stating that the project is essential for jobs and the nation's copper supply. The project, a joint venture between mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, has faced long-standing opposition from groups including the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which cites religious and environmental concerns. The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals imposes a temporary pause while it considers these legal challenges against the major mining operation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has turned down an improved bid of £40 million from Newcastle United for their striker, Yoane Wissa. The offer reportedly consisted of a £35 million initial payment with an additional £5 million in add-ons, which Brentford deemed below their valuation of the player. The 28-year-old DR Congo international, who scored 19 league goals last season, has expressed a desire to move to Newcastle. The rejection comes after Wissa held direct talks with Brentford's owner, signaling a potentially contentious transfer saga as the clubs remain apart on the final transfer fee.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old man, Jason King, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a police officer with a crossbow and stabbing a neighbor's partner. The incident occurred in Downley, Buckinghamshire, after officers responded to a neighbor dispute. King fired repeatedly at police from his window before chasing them and shooting PC Curtis Foster in the leg with a bolt. The officer has since made a full recovery. During sentencing, the judge described King's actions as an attempt to 'hunt down the officer' and noted that he posed a significant risk to the public.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the entire U.S.-Mexico border wall will be painted black, a strategy she credits to President Donald Trump. The rationale is that the black paint will absorb heat, making the surface significantly hotter and more difficult for migrants to climb, especially in high temperatures. This initiative is part of a broader immigration crackdown that includes a $46 million allocation for new wall construction. The administration claims that enhanced border security and mass deportations have led to a dramatic 92% year-over-year reduction in border crossings, with record low numbers recorded in recent months.</p>

In trials, bee colonies that consumed this 'superfood' produced up to 15 times more offspring that survived to adulthood. The breakthrough, led by scientists at the University of Oxford, involved engineering a yeast to produce six essential lipids, called sterols, that bees need for development but are often lacking in conventional supplementary feed. This development could provide a complete nutritional source for bees when natural pollen is scarce, helping to bolster declining populations vital for global crop pollination.</p>
