          <p>Federal Reserve officials are expected to maintain current interest rates at this week's policy meeting, but their updated economic forecasts will likely influence market sentiment. Investors will closely examine the "dot plot," a grid of individual members' rate expectations, to gauge the likelihood of future rate cuts. The committee previously indicated two quarter-percentage-point reductions this year, aligning with current market pricing. However, geopolitical factors, including tariffs and Middle East tensions, add complexity to the Fed's decision-making process, as President Trump continues to urge the Fed to lower rates.

          <p>President Trump convened a meeting with his national security team in the Situation Room to discuss the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, following his early departure from the G7 summit. Despite denying direct contact with Iranian leaders regarding a ceasefire, Trump reiterated his stance that Iran should have accepted a previous deal to prevent the current crisis. He also dismissed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, asserting that Iran is "very close" to having one. Trump has warned Iran against harming U.S. troops in the region, but has not committed to American involvement in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Sayed Naser, an Afghan man who worked with U.S. troops, was detained by ICE after attending a mandatory immigration hearing in San Diego. Naser was legally paroled into the U.S. in 2024 and has a pending Special Immigrant Visa due to his service with the U.S. military. His lawyer argues the detention is unjustified, as Naser followed all rules and has no criminal record, and his detainment is part of a larger trend of increased ICE arrests outside immigration hearings. The Trump administration's policies, including terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans, are causing uncertainty for thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. government.</p>

A lower court ruling that would have returned control of the National Guard to California authorities has been stayed pending the 9th Circuit's decision.

If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and the second-choice votes are then counted. This system has led to unusual alliances, such as state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and city comptroller Brad Lander cross-endorsing each other to prevent former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from winning.

As recreational marijuana becomes legal in more states and daily marijuana users outnumber daily drinkers, the perception of risk around marijuana has declined, but the study highlights potential health effects.

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering adjustments to a key tax bill, potentially creating conflict with the House. The Senate Finance Committee released legislative text addressing Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, aiming to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. Differences between the House and Senate versions include state and local tax deductions, debt limit, and green energy rollbacks. Senate Democrats criticize the proposal, but Republicans are using reconciliation to pass the bill along party lines, setting up a difficult path to final passage.</p>

          <p>The musical “Real Women Have Curves” will close its run on Broadway on June 29, less than two months after its official debut. Despite positive reviews, the show struggled with ticket sales, grossing below the expected amount for a large-scale Broadway musical. The musical, adapted from Josefina López’s play and the 2002 HBO film, centers on a teen with educational aspirations who clashes with her traditional mother in a garment factory in Boyle Heights. The producers expressed pride in representing immigrant communities on Broadway.</p>
