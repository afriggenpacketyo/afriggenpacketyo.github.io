            <p>A federal judge has ordered the Department of Justice to provide daily updates on the efforts to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The judge expressed frustration at a hearing where DOJ lawyers couldn't provide information on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts, despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return. Abrego Garcia, who had a U.S. work permit, was deported amidst accusations of gang affiliation, which he denies. The case highlights ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and federal courts regarding immigration policies and compliance with court orders.</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system is delaying tariff collection for freight shipments, including those from China and nations under a tariff pause.

            <p>President Donald Trump, the oldest elected U.S. president, underwent his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The exam, his first of his second term, puts focus on his health and fitness, particularly given his age. The White House has promised to provide an update on the report, emphasizing transparency. The exam comes after Trump's COVID hospitalization in 2020 and amid questions about his health during the 2024 campaign.</p>

            <h2>Are Trump's Tariffs a Bargaining Chip for a New Economic Order?</h2>

            <p>Amid recent trade actions, Trump's advisor Stephen Miran hinted at establishing a new global economic order beyond tariffs. The White House aims to reduce trade deficits and boost manufacturing. Miran suggested a Bretton Woods-style meeting to reform the international system, potentially devaluing the dollar. This could strengthen America's negotiating power for a grand bargain to serve its economy. Some observers believe this motivates Trump's aggressive tariff policy.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. In a 9-0 ruling, the justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but they also said Judge Paula Xinis may have exceeded her authority. The government has conceded Mr Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error", though it also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies.</p>

            <p>General Motors is reducing production of its BrightDrop electric delivery vans at its CAMI assembly plant in Ontario, Canada, resulting in 500 job losses. The plant will be idled for approximately 20 weeks, starting next month. GM cited market demand and inventory rebalancing as the reasons for the decision, emphasizing that it is unrelated to President Trump's tariffs. The union representing workers at the plant described the move as a crushing blow to the community.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump had his first annual medical checkup Friday since returning to power, putting focus on the fitness of the 78-year-old who is the oldest US president ever elected and has been accused of dodging questions about his health. Republican Trump has repeatedly boasted about his own vigor since starting a second term in the White House, while mocking his 82-year-old Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as decrepit and mentally unfit for office.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed above 4.5% following a steep weekly rise, driven by President Trump's trade moves that have caused investors to sell off U.S. assets. This marks a reversal in investor sentiment, as Treasurys are traditionally viewed as safe havens. The move has complicated the White House's approach to trade, with officials closely monitoring the bond market. The increased yields have sparked concerns within the administration, which has previously emphasized its focus on low financing costs.</p>
