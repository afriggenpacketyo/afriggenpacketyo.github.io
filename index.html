          <p>Klarna, the Swedish online lender famous for its buy now, pay later products, experienced a significant 30% surge in its New York Stock Exchange debut, opening at $52 per share. This strong performance followed an IPO priced at $40, raising $1.37 billion and valuing the company at around $15 billion, reflecting increased investor appetite for high-profile tech offerings. Klarna's public market entry will test its strategic shift into banking, including debit cards and deposit accounts, amidst growing regulatory scrutiny over buy now, pay later loans in various markets. The company's co-founder views the IPO as a milestone, akin to a wedding, with the business journey continuing.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry was observed entering Clarence House, a royal residence, amidst widespread speculation of a meeting with his father, King Charles, who had also arrived there earlier. This potential encounter, the first since February 2024 following the King's cancer diagnosis, is viewed as a significant step towards mending their sometimes tense relationship, with Harry having previously voiced a desire for family reconciliation. The Duke is in the UK for charity events and is scheduled to return to the US soon, though there are no reports of him meeting with Prince William during this visit.</p>

          <p>Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, has surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's richest person, with his wealth soaring to $393 billion after Oracle's shares surged over 40%. This dramatic increase is attributed to the company's surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and substantial artificial intelligence deals. Oracle reported a surge in demand for its data centers from AI companies, projecting significant revenue growth and securing major contracts. Meanwhile, Musk's net worth declined as Tesla shares fell amid investor jitters over policy changes and consumer backlash. Ellison is also exploring other ventures, including a potential bid for TikTok.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's 30-day direct control over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department is scheduled to conclude, following his declaration of a "public safety emergency" on August 11. Despite the expiration, a significant federal presence, including National Guard troops, is anticipated to remain in the capital. Trump lauded the intervention as a success, claiming the city was "virtually crime free" and citing a 15% overall crime reduction compared to the previous year. However, the takeover drew criticism and a lawsuit from the city's attorney general, who deemed it unconstitutional, while Congress has opted against extending the president's direct authority.</p>

          <h2>Las Vegas Casinos Replace Live Dealers with Electronic Games Amid Tourism Slump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 13:05:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Las Vegas casinos are increasingly replacing live dealers with electronic table games (ETGs) as tourism to Sin City continues to decline, with July visitors dropping 12% year-over-year. The Golden Gate Hotel & Casino is making this shift, with owner Derek Stevens attributing it to evolving consumer preferences for electronic play, influenced by the pandemic and the quality of new slot machines. While slot machines remain popular, Stevens believes ETGs will attract a different demographic and bring value back to the tables, relocating displaced dealers to other casinos. The industry faces challenges from tariffs, seasonal slowdowns, and online gaming, alongside a "bifurcation" in the market hitting the lower-end segment.</p>

          <p>Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has formally requested United States support in combating transnational drug smuggling, emphasizing the need for enhanced cooperation during a visit to the port of Antwerp with US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. De Wever commended the Trump administration's initiatives against drug trafficking in the Caribbean and across the Americas, stressing that criminals operate without borders. Antwerp, a critical entry point, saw record cocaine seizures in 2023, and both officials highlighted the urgency of shared efforts to dismantle organized crime's financial models and address the widespread impact of drug poisoning on citizens.</p>

The complaint claims Patel stated his job depended on firing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump, who allegedly hadn't forgotten the FBI's past actions against him. These decorated veterans, including former acting FBI director Brian Driscoll, were dismissed without full pensions, part of a broader FBI overhaul. The lawsuit also implicates White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller in pressuring for personnel actions, with one official reportedly told that creating "panic and anxiety" in the workforce was the intent.</p>

          <p>US-bound freight trade is experiencing an unusual slowdown, with Chinese imports dropping 27% year-over-year for three consecutive weeks, defying typical peak season trends. Logistics experts note a lack of major orders for late September, usually a busy period before China's Golden Week holiday. This decline is significantly impacting sectors like furniture, toys, and electronics, primarily attributed to the ongoing trade war and earlier inventory front-loading. Ocean carriers have already announced 35 blank sailings for October, indicating reduced capacity and higher freight rates, reflecting the trade war's sustained negative impact on North American trade.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order that temporarily blocks him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, while a lawsuit challenging her removal proceeds. The judge ruled that Cook demonstrated a strong likelihood that her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act, which requires "cause" for such dismissals, and emphasized the public interest in the Fed's independence. Trump announced Cook's dismissal last month, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which Cook denies. Her attorneys argue this is a pretextual move amidst Trump's pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the liberal argument that Democrats should shut down the government to curb President Trump's increasingly authoritarian actions, such as pretextual investigations and federal control of police. While some liberals advocate for this to spotlight Trump's abuses and galvanize the base, the article argues such a move is unlikely to achieve its official goal of forcing Republican concessions. Historically, shutdowns have failed to achieve legislative aims and often lead to public backlash against their instigators. The piece suggests that any shutdown strategy should prioritize maximizing the Democratic Party's electoral competitiveness in 2026, rather than merely avoiding "complicity."</p>

Researchers used DNA barcoding on 29 shark products, finding that 31% were from critically endangered species like great hammerhead and scalloped hammerhead sharks, with 93% ambiguously labeled as "shark." This mislabeling not only threatens shark populations but also poses health risks to consumers due to high levels of mercury and arsenic in some species.

          <p>Alison McGovern has withdrawn from the contest to become Labour's next deputy leader, citing insufficient support from MPs and endorsing Bridget Phillipson, who is emerging as a frontrunner. McGovern's exit allows her supporters to back other candidates before the deadline. Phillipson, the Education Secretary, is expected to clear the required 80 nominations swiftly, potentially becoming the sole candidate if rivals fail to consolidate votes. The race highlights internal party dynamics, with some calling for a female leader from northern England to balance the London-centric, male-dominated leadership, a credential Phillipson emphasizes.</p>

          <p>US-South Korea relations are strained after federal agents detained over 300 South Korean nationals at a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations. The workers, part of 475 people rounded up, were awaiting a charter flight home after the operation, which South Korean President Lee Jae Myung criticized as an "unjust infringement." The incident tests ties crucial politically, militarily, and economically, especially after South Korea pledged $350 billion in US investment. South Korean officials are negotiating for more skilled worker visas, while the US stresses legal immigration, highlighting challenges for foreign investment.</p>

          <p>The Labor Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has launched an investigation into the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) methods for collecting and reporting jobs and inflation data. This probe comes amid pressure from the Trump administration, which questioned the BLS's data accuracy following recent downward revisions to employment figures, including a record 911,000 drop in March 2025 estimates. President Trump had previously fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a weak jobs report. The OIG's review will focus on the challenges and mitigation strategies related to collecting Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index, and monthly employment data.</p>

Scientists identified organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, compounds often byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter on Earth. While stressing that in-depth analysis, ideally on Earth, is needed for conclusive evidence, lead researcher Joel Hurowitz called it the best candidate yet in the search for long-ago life. The discovery marks a significant step in understanding Mars' past habitability, though non-biological processes could also be responsible.</p>

Analysts were "blown away" by Oracle's projections for its cloud infrastructure revenue, cementing its position as a key AI enabler despite missing first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations.
