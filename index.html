          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family, and a close associate, accusing him of allowing cocaine production to surge to record levels. The sanctions freeze their U.S. assets and block transactions with American entities, marking a significant escalation in tensions between the two leaders. Petro has publicly criticized U.S. counter-narcotics operations in the region and has stated he will never kneel, viewing the sanctions as a paradoxical response to his country's long-standing efforts to combat drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Now in his 21st NFL season and first with the Pittsburgh Steelers, veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers has confirmed his intention to retire as a member of the Green Bay Packers. The 41-year-old expressed deep affection for the franchise where he spent 18 years and won a Super Bowl, stating he has "nothing but love for the organization." This follows a tradition of Packers greats, like Brett Favre, who returned to the team ceremonially after playing for other franchises at the end of their careers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After Kim Kardashian revealed her diagnosis with a brain aneurysm in a reality show teaser, she appeared to attribute it to stress, prompting medical clarification. Doctors explain that while stress itself does not directly cause an aneurysm, it can elevate blood pressure, a key risk factor alongside genetics and smoking. Most brain aneurysms are small, asymptomatic, and do not rupture, but managing blood pressure and stress is crucial for prevention. Experts hope this high-profile case raises awareness about the condition, which is more prevalent in women.</p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a temporary halt to his province's anti-tariff advertising campaign in the United States, a move intended to de-escalate a trade dispute. The decision came after President Trump terminated trade negotiations, calling the ad—which featured former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs—"FAKE" and "egregious." Ford stated the ad's goal of initiating a conversation was achieved, and the pause, effective Monday, is a gesture to allow for the resumption of talks between the two closely linked economies.</p>

          <p>Six men have been sentenced to prison for their roles in an arson attack on a London warehouse that provided aid to Ukraine, an act orchestrated by the Russian state. The ringleader, Dylan Earl, was recruited by the Wagner Group and received a 17-year sentence for what the judge called a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage." The case marks the first convictions under the UK's National Security Act 2023, designed to combat hostile state activity that falls short of traditional espionage.</p>

Although body-worn camera footage showed he did not use his baton as claimed, the panel ruled that sharing a false account that "revelled in the use of force" was a serious breach of professional standards.</p>
