          <p>Dover Corp.'s shares increased after the company reported mixed first-quarter results, despite lowering its full-year outlook. The market interpreted the guidance cut as management's conservatism rather than a reflection of underlying business weakness. CEO Richard Tobin attributed the adjusted forecast to potential tariff-driven project delays, not customer feedback or data. The company ended the first quarter with $2.8 billion in available capital, potentially for acquisitions or share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warnings of potential retail shortages are emerging as CEOs of major retail stores express concerns to President Trump about a prolonged trade war with China. Apparel and footwear, heavily reliant on Chinese imports, are particularly vulnerable, with tariffs potentially acting as import bans. Companies are anticipating price increases and consumer hesitancy, leading to order cancellations and goods being held in warehouses. Supply chain experts suggest that lower-end stores with lean inventories will be the first to experience shortages, particularly in toys, games, budget home goods, and apparel.</p>

The project is a key part of President Trump's energy agenda, aiming to ship liquefied natural gas from Alaska to Asia. The National Energy Dominance Council seeks to convene officials from the trade ministries of Japan and South Korea for a summit in Alaska in June. Proponents want signed letters of intent from both countries to invest in or purchase gas from the project.</p>

          <p>Over 50 House Democrats have signed a letter demanding answers from U.S. government officials regarding a potential data breach involving sensitive worker information. The letter is addressed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and concerns allegations that DOGE, possibly led by Elon Musk, may have removed sensitive labor data and compromised NLRB systems. Lawmakers are concerned about potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's involvement with companies facing NLRB cases. The NLRB denies granting DOGE access to its systems.</p>

The trade dispute escalated earlier this month when Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting China to respond with retaliatory measures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut federal funding from public schools participating in certain diversity and equity initiatives. The judge found that the administration's actions to withhold funds would "cripple the operations of many educational institutions" and violate executive branch power. The ruling is limited to schools working with the plaintiffs, the National Education Association and the Center for Black Educator Development. The lawsuit was filed after the administration demanded states agree their schools would not participate in programs violating the administration's definition of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked key sections of President Trump's executive order that makes sweeping changes to voting and elections. The ruling puts a hold on the order's instruction to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to change the national mail voter registration form to require proof of U.S. citizenship. The judge stated that the Constitution entrusts Congress and the States, not the President, with the authority to regulate federal elections. The decision also pauses a provision requiring government agencies to assess citizenship before distributing voter registration forms to public assistance enrollees.</p>
