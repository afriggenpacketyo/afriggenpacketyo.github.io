          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused India of engaging in "arbitrage" by purchasing discounted Russian crude oil, refining it, and then reselling the products to regions like Europe. This practice has reportedly generated substantial profits for some of India's wealthiest families amid the war in Ukraine. The accusation comes as the Trump administration imposes additional tariffs on Indian exports in response, though some analysts note the U.S. initially encouraged India to buy Russian oil to prevent a global price spike following the invasion.

          <p>Shares of Viking Therapeutics dropped over 30% following the release of mid-stage trial data for its oral obesity drug that failed to meet investor expectations. The results showed less efficacy and higher rates of side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, compared to competing oral treatments from industry leaders Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Analysts suggest the data diminishes Viking's prospects in the highly competitive weight-loss drug market and reinforces the dominance of its larger pharmaceutical rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

Health officials attribute the resurgence of the highly contagious disease to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten MMR vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold required for community immunity.

          <p>Despite recent market volatility, a Fidelity Investments study shows that many investors remain confident, though seasoned investors are more cautious than newer ones. Certified financial planner Tim Maurer advises that all investors should be "always calibrating" their risk tolerance based on their long-term goals and changing life circumstances. Experts recommend maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, utilizing low-cost vehicles like ETFs to gain broad market exposure, and considering buffer ETFs for downside protection during periods of potential economic headwinds.

          <p>An analysis article suggests European leaders are adopting a supplicant-like approach to President Trump, offering praise and concessions in an effort to influence his policy on the Ukraine war. This diplomatic dance aims to counter Russian President Vladimir Putin's own flattery, which appears to resonate with Trump's view of geopolitics as a contest between powerful leaders. While European efforts have achieved some success in shifting Trump's stance, the author argues that a more sustainable strategy would be for Europe to develop its own coherent and autonomous power to command respect.</p>

          <h2>The Political Origins of the Thong Swimsuit by Designer Rudi Gernreich</h2>

          <p>This article explores the history of the thong, revealing its creation as a political statement by Austrian-born designer Rudi Gernreich in 1974. Gernreich, a gay man and early LGBTQ+ rights activist, designed the minimal garment in protest of a ban on nude bathing at a Los Angeles beach. His work, including the topless "monokini," was driven by a philosophy of liberating the body from sexual hang-ups and promoting unisex fashion. The thong's origin was not about sexualization but about challenging societal prudery and advocating for bodily freedom.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the UK government has withdrawn its demand for Apple to create a "backdoor" for accessing the encrypted data of American customers. The claim follows a contentious dispute where the UK Home Office issued a notice under the Investigatory Powers Act, prompting a legal challenge from Apple and criticism from U.S. officials, including President Trump. This alleged reversal marks a significant development in the transatlantic debate over privacy, encryption, and law enforcement access to digital information.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Washington, Germany's potential role in providing security guarantees for Ukraine is under discussion, though differences in approach with the U.S. have emerged. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized the need for a ceasefire before substantive peace talks, a position that contrasts with President Trump's push for a direct comprehensive agreement. The debate in Germany now includes the possibility of contributing to a peacekeeping mission, with political figures expressing varied opinions on deploying German troops as part of a future security arrangement for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Chinese social media platform Weibo has shut down several accounts accused of promoting hostility between genders. An account named "Lilian Shuodao" was permanently banned for what the platform called "continuously stigmatising the opposite sex and posting extreme anti-marriage remarks." Another account was banned for insulting remarks targeting men, while a third with over 650,000 followers was temporarily suspended for similar violations. This move reflects a broader effort by Chinese authorities to moderate online content and curb what they deem to be divisive discourse.</p>

The initiative involves classifying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as consumables, a policy shift that mirrors a recent U.S. approach designed to accelerate acquisition.

          <p>A growing cohort of men, both gay and straight, are choosing to become single fathers through surrogacy or adoption, a demographic that was virtually nonexistent two decades ago. This trend reflects shifting societal norms, rising singlehood rates, and a reprioritization of life goals, particularly since the pandemic. For many, fatherhood offers a profound sense of purpose and connection, prompting them to navigate the complex and expensive legal and medical processes involved. The phenomenon highlights changing perspectives on masculinity, family structures, and the deep-seated desire for parenthood.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's "High and Low," starring Denzel Washington as a successful music producer facing a moral dilemma when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake. The movie review suggests the film serves as a self-aware satire, with Lee examining what happens when a creative force, much like himself, risks becoming stale and disconnected from the streets that once inspired him. While the film's beginning is noted as choppy, it builds into a compelling thriller that reconnects its protagonist with a grittier reality.</p>

          <p>This article examines the recent explosion in popularity of matcha, the finely ground Japanese green tea, questioning why it has become a mainstream phenomenon nearly a decade after its initial, more niche introduction in the US. The current trend is largely driven by social media, where matcha's aesthetic qualities and the ritual of its preparation are highly visible. Unlike its first wave, the current craze sees matcha heavily customized with sugars and syrups, making it more palatable to a wider audience and transforming it into a symbol of individualized wellness and online cultural consensus.</p>
