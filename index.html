        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has altered its welfare reform bill after significant pressure from over 100 Labour backbenchers threatened its passage. In a notable concession, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall confirmed that current recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not be affected by planned cuts. These changes will now only apply to future claimants, a move seen as a major climbdown to ensure the bill passes. The decision follows intense negotiations and marks the third government U-turn in a month.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions, prominent economists argued that China must undergo structural reforms to transition into a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu stated that China's long-term prosperity depends on becoming a major consumer country, not just a production powerhouse. She suggested that local governments should be evaluated on consumption metrics to incentivize this shift. The call for reform comes as China faces global trade tensions due to its highly competitive exports, emphasizing the need for more balanced economic relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, Chongqing has enhanced its tourism infrastructure, including establishing one-stop service centers and improving transport links.

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a significant 9.1% year-on-year decline in May, the largest drop since October of the previous year, signaling that stimulus measures may be insufficient. The statistics bureau attributed the plunge to weak domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods, with the automotive and mining sectors hit particularly hard. Despite this, some economists believe Beijing may not introduce further stimulus immediately, given other mixed economic data showing some areas of strength. This downturn highlights ongoing challenges in sustaining the country's economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

During the two-week period, investigators conducted extensive searches, uncovering 169 weapons and 310 cellphones. Officials stated the measures were necessary to root out contraband and restore order within the correctional facilities, with the remaining prisons still under close observation.</p>

          <p>The Santa Ynez Reservoir in Pacific Palisades is now back in operation after being offline since early 2024 for extensive repairs to its torn floating cover, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced. The reservoir was notably empty during the destructive January firestorm, raising questions from residents and officials about whether its absence contributed to firefighting water supply issues. While the DWP has restored the reservoir, which provides supplementary supply and system redundancy, inquiries into the circumstances of its unavailability during the emergency are ongoing. Officials are now planning a more durable cover design.</p>

          <p>A project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is providing a potential template for how cities can combat the urban heat island effect, where dense development creates dangerously high temperatures. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, has transformed a single city block by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. Research shows such measures can significantly reduce peak temperatures, a critical intervention as climate change intensifies heat waves. The project is an urban laboratory for solutions that can be replicated in other heat-vulnerable neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Asian American communities are urging solidarity with Latinos, who have been the primary targets of recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles. Organizers warn that Asian immigrant communities could be next and note that many Southeast Asian immigrants with long-standing, stayed deportation orders are already being detained. While Latinos constitute the largest group of undocumented residents in the county, Asian immigrants are the second-largest. Leaders held a news conference to denounce the enforcement actions and emphasize that their communities are only protected when they stand together with all targeted groups.</p>

          <p>José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the fugitive drug trafficker known as "Fito," has been recaptured in Ecuador more than a year after his escape from a high-security prison. Macías, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang and wanted in the U.S. on cocaine importation charges, was found hiding in the basement of a house in his hometown of Manta. His escape in early 2024 triggered a wave of violence across Ecuador, leading the government to declare war on criminal gangs. President Daniel Noboa announced the arrest and stated that proceedings for his extradition to the United States would begin.</p>
