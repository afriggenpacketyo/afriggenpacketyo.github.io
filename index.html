            <p>The Trump administration announced a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University after the university rejected demands to eliminate DEI programs and screen international students for ideological concerns. Harvard President Alan Garber argued that the demands represented governmental regulation of academic freedom, while federal agencies asserted that taxpayer support requires upholding civil rights laws and addressing antisemitism. The administration believes that Harvard has an 'entitlement mindset' regarding federal investment, which has led to a freeze on multi-year grants and contracts. Garber stated that retreating from these partnerships risks the health, well-being, and economic security of the nation.</p>

            <p>Research indicates a nearly one-third decrease in plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidized theatres compared to a decade ago, attributed to funding cuts and rising costs. Theatre executives express concern over the reduction in opportunities for young artists and the impact on the industry's workforce, citing low pay and job insecurity. Some venues are co-producing shows to mitigate costs, leading to larger-scale productions, but smaller, riskier shows are being squeezed out. Changing audience tastes also contribute, with a preference for less serious drama.</p>

Instead, companies plan to relocate supply chains to lower-tariff countries, with over half citing cost as the primary deterrent. The survey also indicates concerns about consumer demand, raw material prices, and the administration's inconsistent strategy. A majority of respondents believe the Trump administration is 'bullying corporate America,' and automation is expected to dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

While Republicans and Democrats have condemned the attack, the incident underscores the broader context of rising political violence since Trump's initial campaign. Trump's past rhetoric and actions have been seen as condoning or even encouraging violence, making his condemnations less meaningful.</p>

            <p>President Trump's return to the White House has sparked fresh tensions with Canada, raising questions about his ultimate goals for the country. Disputes range from the 'Grey Zone' lobster fishing area to potential designs on Canadian water and natural resources. Trump has repeatedly called Canada the '51st state,' leading to concerns about potential annexation. Experts suggest that Trump's actions reflect a shift in U.S. foreign policy, prioritizing a continental fortress and access to resources.</p>

Officials were able to successfully preserve messages from the devices of other officials. The declaration comes after advocacy group American Oversight raised concerns about the messages.</p>

The inquiries, under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, have a 270-day completion deadline. These investigations follow similar actions leading to tariffs on steel, aluminum, and the auto industry. Drugmakers argue that tariffs could increase shortages and reduce patient access, while Trump aims to increase domestic drug manufacturing to reduce reliance on other countries.
