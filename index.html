        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House criticized Amazon for its plan to show customers the cost of President Trump's tariffs alongside product prices, labeling it a hostile and political act. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon didn't do this during the Biden administration's high inflation. Amazon's move is seen as a demonstration that American consumers, not China, bear the brunt of these policies. Other retailers like Shein and Temu have also started adding surcharges to highlight tariff costs, with Temu adding an import charge of around 145% for each item.</p>

          <p>A day after a widespread blackout paralyzed Spain and Portugal, electricity was restored to most areas, though the cause remains unknown. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stated that over 95% of the power supply had been recovered, while Portugal reported full operational status. Officials have ruled out cybersecurity attacks, human error, and meteorological causes, suggesting the outage was triggered by two separate power outages in southwestern Spain. The blackout caused widespread disruptions, including traffic light failures, halted trains, and airport delays, affecting tens of millions of people.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn higher returns. Current national average CD yields range from 1.69% to 2.00%, but top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.50%. To get a good CD rate, consider online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs, as the inverted yield curve makes them more lucrative. A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs by buying some one-year, some two-year, some three-year, etc. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to monitor and report office occupancy data as part of its push to end remote work arrangements.

The administration aims to shrink the federal real estate footprint and ensure compliance with President Trump's return-to-office policy.

          <p>As President Trump marks his first 100 days in office, his administration is highlighting its efforts to reform the Social Security Administration (SSA), despite accusations from Democrats of planning to cut benefits. The administration claims to have made significant progress on the Social Security Fairness Act and identified over $1 billion in cost avoidance through common-sense approaches. These reforms include reducing software licensing, repairing furniture, and streamlining case assignment systems, while implementing fraud prevention tools to improve the accuracy of death data. Democrats have criticized these efforts, with some referring to Social Security as a Ponzi scheme.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) is withdrawing its previous forecast for solid profit growth this year due to the uncertainty created by President Trump's trade policies. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on imported cars and parts, impacting GM's operations, as about half the cars GM sells in the United States are made abroad. GM's chief financial officer stated that the impact of the tariffs could be material, leading the company to reassess its financial guidance. The company also reported a 7% decline in first-quarter profit, hurt by a drop in earnings in North America.</p>

          <p>Prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing face challenges due to high mortgage rates and limited housing inventory. Current average mortgage rates are 6.14% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.90% for a 30-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.21% and 6.91%, respectively. To secure a good rate, strengthen your credit profile, compare different lenders, and consider shorter loan terms. Experts anticipate some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, but borrowers should still shop around to find the best rates and terms available.</p>
