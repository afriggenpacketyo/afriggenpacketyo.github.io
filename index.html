          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that there is a significant opportunity for a major trade agreement between the United States and China, suggesting a collaborative rebalancing of the global financial system. Bessent outlined a plan to reform the World Bank and IMF, urging the World Bank to cease lending to economically advanced nations like China. He emphasized that China's economic rise, while impressive, necessitates its graduation from developing country status within international financial institutions. Bessent's remarks come amidst ongoing trade tensions and high tariffs imposed by President Trump, signaling a potential shift towards de-escalation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk addressed Tesla's future, focusing on robotaxi timelines, Optimus robots, tariffs, energy, and the company's overall vision. Musk stated that he would be reducing his federal budget-slashing efforts starting in May, allowing him to allocate more time to Tesla. Musk tried to rally Tesla bulls, brushing off a weak first-quarter earnings report and touting a future of "sustainable abundance." The electric vehicle faces a turbulent year, with shares down nearly 40%, European market share slumping along with deliveries.</p>
