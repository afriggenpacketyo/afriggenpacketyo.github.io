          <p>The article discusses the climate of fear among immigrants in Southern California following increased ICE activity. Donald Trump's administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, leading to more aggressive tactics by ICE agents, particularly in the Los Angeles area. The article shares the story of a Nicaraguan couple seeking work at a Home Depot who witnessed ICE agents detaining people without warrants. The increased ICE activity has led to a reduction in the number of people migrating to the United States, as well as causing those who are already here to live in fear and isolation.</p>

Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, with witnesses testifying to alleged sexual assault, severe physical abuse, and drug trafficking.

The Mengzhou spacecraft has two versions: one for near-Earth operations and another for deep-space lunar missions.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing further questioning from Congress amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. Lawmakers are expected to press him on a range of issues, including the ban on transgender troops, the use of unsecured messaging apps, and the shifting of funds from troop housing to border security. The U.S. has repositioned military assets in the region to protect personnel and interests, and Hegseth has stated that the U.S. is postured defensively to pursue a peace deal. Hegseth's tenure has been marked by social changes at the Pentagon and scrutiny over his handling of international security crises.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports declined by 1.7% year-over-year in May, the sharpest drop since September 2024, driven by plummeting shipments to the United States.

The Bank of Japan has indicated that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors. The trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May, and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. remain challenging, with Japan prioritizing concessions for its key automobile sector.
