          <p>A significant number of drivers, about 26.6% in Q2 2025, are "underwater" on their auto loans, meaning they owe more than their car is worth. This figure, the highest in four years, averages $6,754 in negative equity. This article explains how this trend complicates new vehicle purchases, as drivers must either pay the outstanding balance or roll it into a new loan, potentially increasing overall debt. Factors like rapid depreciation, longer loan terms, and smaller down payments contribute to this issue. Experts advise consumers to keep their current vehicles if feasible, or to consider guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance when trading in an upside-down car to mitigate financial risk.

          <p>During the Jacksonville Jaguars' recent 31-27 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, quarterback Trevor Lawrence was involved in a tense sideline exchange with head coach Liam Coen. Lawrence was observed waving off Coen after an inaccurate pass on a critical late-game down, prompting Coen to visibly express frustration about the throw. Despite the apparent disagreement, Coen later downplayed the incident, characterizing it as a normal emotional reaction within a competitive environment. This article delves into the specific play and the subsequent comments from both the coach and the broader context, offering insights into the team's internal dynamics and the pressures faced during a close game.</p>

          <p>Midtown Atlanta's 10th Street NE and Piedmont Avenue NE are scheduled for extensive closures over several weeks due to critical sewer repairs. Starting September 15 with intermittent lane closures, full, round-the-clock closures will be in effect from September 17 until mid to late October, contingent on weather conditions. The Department of Watershed Management is undertaking this project to remove and replace existing sewer mains, aiming to address defects and significantly increase the sewer system’s overall capacity. Motorists are strongly advised to exercise caution, follow posted detours, and avoid the area if possible, though access to essential services for residents and businesses will be maintained.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy asserts that Manchester United's ongoing struggles are primarily attributable to player selection and their deployment, rather than the team's 3-4-2-1 formation itself. The article highlights that while the team has shown improved compactness, individual errors, particularly from Bruno Fernandes playing in a deeper central midfield role, are consistently costing them crucial points. Murphy argues that Fernandes' natural defensive instincts are not suited for this position, and other players, like Luke Shaw, appear uncomfortable in their assigned roles. He concludes that the manager's choices regarding personnel within the established system are the fundamental cause of the team's inconsistent performances.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a tragic increase in maternal and infant deaths in Afghanistan, directly linked to the Trump administration's abrupt cuts to US aid, which led to the closure of over 400 medical facilities. The article shares harrowing personal accounts, including the story of Shahnaz and her baby, who died after finding their local clinic shut down. The US justified the aid withdrawal citing concerns about funds benefiting the Taliban, a claim the Taliban denies. This dire situation underscores the devastating human cost of reduced humanitarian assistance, severely impacting women's access to vital healthcare and exacerbating a profound public health crisis.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans, offering interest-free installment payments, are rapidly gaining popularity among consumers, with usage projected to reach 91.5 million Americans by 2025. This article delves into why traditional banks and credit card companies are increasingly wary of the BNPL trend. It highlights that BNPL directly challenges their established revenue streams by diverting transactions and reducing credit card utilization. Furthermore, the opaque nature of BNPL transactions creates a "giant black hole" in assessing consumer credit quality, posing significant risks for financial institutions. The widespread adoption of these alternatives signals a fundamental shift in consumer credit behavior. (not investment advice)</p>
