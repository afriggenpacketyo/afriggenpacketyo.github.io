          <p>U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver from New Jersey has been charged with assaulting law enforcement officers outside an ICE detention facility, as announced by Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba. The incident occurred during a protest on May 9, where tensions escalated, allegedly leading to McIver's assault and interference with officers. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated, mischaracterizing her actions to deter legislative oversight, while top House Democrats have vowed to respond vigorously, denouncing the charges as an abuse of power. The charges against Newark's Mayor Baraka were dropped by the U.S. Attorney.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares rise over 11% in its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025. The funds are allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL's global expansion coincides with similar moves by Chinese EV makers, though tariffs imposed by the U.S. and EU have presented challenges. The company posted a 9.7% drop in its 2024 annual revenue due to intense competition in China's EV market, despite a 15% increase in net profit.</p>

James described a work environment where employees were expected to serve in "Mr. Combs' kingdom." Combs has pleaded not guilty, denying allegations of sex trafficking and racketeering, arguing that while he might have committed other crimes, he has not sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone.

          <p>The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, after Democratic opposition previously stalled its progress due to concerns about the Trump family's ties to the digital asset industry. The bill aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to assets like the U.S. dollar. Despite some Democratic support, Senator Elizabeth Warren remains critical, arguing the bill puts consumers at risk and enables corruption, particularly related to the Trump family's crypto ventures. The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote, allowing the Senate to proceed to final passage.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs off the coast of Honolulu are experiencing severe bleaching due to warming ocean temperatures, threatening marine life and coastal protection. Marine scientist Greg Asner reports that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, leading to the expulsion of algae that give corals their color. The rapid decline is exacerbated by record-high ocean surface temperatures, with reefs dying in weeks instead of years. While the situation is dire, efforts to educate tourists and implement underwater nurseries offer some hope for future recovery if fossil fuel use is curbed.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move aims to stimulate the economy amid concerns that trade tensions could hinder growth. The rate cuts followed actions by state-backed commercial lenders to decrease deposit rates, which supports lower lending rates. The stimulus package includes reductions to lending rates and the reserve requirements for banks. Despite trade-war fears, global investment banks have raised their forecasts for China's economic growth, though caution remains due to deflationary pressures and potential tariff increases.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in New Orleans after ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish jail through a hole in a cell wall, raising concerns about the facility's troubled history and lax oversight. Four inmates have been apprehended, but six remain at large, prompting officials to caution residents to be vigilant. The jail, under a federal consent decree since 2013, faces issues including overcrowding and understaffing. Governor Jeff Landry has demanded answers, attributing the escape to broader failures in the criminal justice system, as some escapees were awaiting trial for extended periods.</p>

          <p>House Republicans plan to vote this week on legislation containing President Trump's second term agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense priorities. Despite moving out of committee, fractures persist within the GOP conference, casting doubt on its passage. President Trump is expected to visit House Republicans to urge support for the bill. Disagreements remain on capping the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and the implementation timeline for Medicaid work requirements, with conservative hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates reluctant to slash Medicaid.</p>
