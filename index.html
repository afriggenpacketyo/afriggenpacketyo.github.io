          <p>Despite President Trump's assertions of active trade negotiations with China, Chinese officials have refuted these claims, stating that no such talks are currently taking place. Trump's comments appeared to be an attempt to reassure jittery financial markets amid escalating trade tensions between the two countries. The S&P 500 has declined 10% since Trump's inauguration, reflecting market unease. This discrepancy highlights the uncertainty surrounding the trade war and its potential impact on the global economy.</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers are raising prices on various products due to increased import costs resulting from President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked price increases on 930 products, averaging a 29% jump since April 9. While Amazon disputes the extent of the increases, merchants are struggling to absorb the extra costs, potentially impacting consumers. CEO Andy Jassy has stated that Amazon will attempt to keep prices low, but some sellers will need to pass the tariff costs onto consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over interest rate policy has sparked concerns about the independence of the US central bank. Trump has publicly pressured Powell to lower interest rates, leading to comparisons with President Nixon's interference with the Fed in the 1970s. Experts warn that undermining the Fed's independence could erode market confidence and lead to economic instability. Despite denying intentions to fire Powell, Trump maintains his right to voice concerns about the Fed's policies.</p>

          <p>The film "On Swift Horses" examines the anxieties and opportunities of 1950s America through a love triangle involving two brothers and a housewife. Muriel, stifled by her marriage to Lee, finds herself drawn to Lee's brother, Julius, while Julius grapples with his own hidden desires. The film explores themes of repression and the need to break free, though it ultimately falls into episodic management, sacrificing deeper psychological exploration.</p>
