        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SK Hynix, a South Korean chipmaker, reported a significant increase in quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose approximately 42% year-over-year, with operating profit surging 158%. The company cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies, potentially impacting demand in the second half of the year, though they anticipate limited impact on AI server demand. The company expects continued spending on AI by Big Tech, fueled by open-source AI models and sovereign AI projects, further boosting memory demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fossil find in northeastern China unveils a dinosaur species, Huadanosaurus sinensis, that consumed a mammal, which itself may have preyed on dinosaurs. Scientists discovered two small mammals inside the juvenile dinosaur's stomach cavity, one being a eutherian and the other a gobiconodontid, a group known to include Repenomamus, which previously showed evidence of preying on small dinosaurs. This discovery highlights a complex predator-prey relationship between dinosaurs and mammals 125 million years ago, creating an ecological loop where Huadanosaurus turned the tables by preying on mammal predators.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's Republican congressional delegation are pressing President Donald Trump to reconsider FEMA's denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March.

          <p>A bill in California, AB 942, aiming to significantly reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels installed before April 15, 2023, has ignited a fierce battle between union electrical workers, big utilities, and solar energy advocates. Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, who previously worked for Southern California Edison, introduced the bill, arguing that it addresses equity issues as non-solar customers bear higher electric bills due to the credits. Environmental groups and solar industry representatives are opposing the bill, contending that it breaks the state's promise of 20-year incentives for solar contracts and would disincentivize renewable energy adoption.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, has issued a warning about the significant risk to patients posed by exhausted hospital staff. The report cites medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention, and disrespectful behavior as common problems associated with staff fatigue. The watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs, with staff members citing fatigue and workload as contributing factors. The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has steadily declined during his first three months in office, according to a New York Times polling average. His approval rating has fallen to approximately 45 percent, down from 52 percent shortly after taking office. This decline is slightly faster than that of his predecessors, although American presidents typically see an erosion of support over time.</p>

          <p>A new report from the American Lung Association reveals that approximately 156 million U.S. residents live in areas with failing grades for smog and soot pollution.

The most polluted cities are concentrated in California, while poor air quality is increasingly shifting eastward due to factors like extreme heat, wildfires, and lack of precipitation.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight synthetic food dyes in the American food supply. HHS and the FDA are looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with food manufacturers to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in foods. Kennedy has been vocal about his opposition to artificial dyes, citing studies linking them to behavioral changes and cancer in animals. Experts are divided on the safety of synthetic food dyes, with some advocating for their elimination and others calling for more research.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the installation of a makeup studio next to the Pentagon press briefing room, costing several thousand dollars. The renovation, which was initially planned to cost more than $40,000, was scaled back. The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement. Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist, a defense official told CBS News.</p>
