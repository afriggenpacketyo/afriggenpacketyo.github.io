        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 humanitarian groups, including Oxfam and MSF, have jointly accused Israel of "weaponizing aid" in Gaza by imposing stricter regulations and denying delivery permits, leading to deepening starvation. They report that many international NGOs have been unable to deliver supplies since March, leaving hospitals without basic necessities and vulnerable populations dying. Israel denies restricting aid, stating that new rules ensure supplies reach the population directly and not Hamas, with their military body Cogat reporting around 300 trucks entering daily. The UN, however, indicates 600 trucks are needed daily, highlighting a significant shortfall.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent ADP research indicates that 60% of Singaporean workers are now living paycheck to paycheck in 2024, a notable increase from 53% in 2021 and higher than the Asia-Pacific average. This trend is attributed to rising living costs, including expensive housing and import reliance, which have outpaced income growth, shrinking purchasing power. Experts also point to shifting social and cultural priorities, with younger generations spending more on experiences and lifestyle, sometimes beyond their means, rather than prioritizing long-term savings. This financial strain is most prevalent among middle-income earners.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record $6.1 billion, marking the largest sale price ever for an American professional sports team. Chisholm will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with full control expected by 2028, potentially valuing the franchise at $7.3 billion. This sale surpasses previous records, including the Washington Commanders and Phoenix Suns, highlighting the escalating value of major sports franchises. The former ownership group, which purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million, oversaw two NBA championships.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has ruled that Pinkfong's global hit "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize a version by US composer Jonathan Wright, concluding a six-year legal dispute. The court affirmed that Wright's 2011 interpretation lacked sufficient originality to be considered a distinct copyrighted work, as it was based on a public domain folk song. Pinkfong's 2016 adaptation achieved phenomenal viral success, becoming one of YouTube's most-viewed videos. This landmark decision clarifies copyright protection standards for popular arrangements derived from traditional works, affirming the original song's public domain status.</p>

Fairfax County Public Schools has also initiated an external investigation, stating that such actions, if true, would be unacceptable.

Rossi, who appeared in court under his alias Nicholas Alahverdian, denied all charges, but jurors deliberated for over eight hours before reaching their verdict. The victim described a controlling relationship that culminated in the assault. Rossi was apprehended in a Glasgow hospital in 2021, recognized by his distinctive tattoos from an Interpol notice. He faces another sexual assault trial in Utah County in September.</p>

          <p>This article explains BTecs, which are practical vocational qualifications equivalent to GCSEs (Level 2) or A-levels (Level 3), assessed through coursework, exams, and projects. They serve as a pathway to university or direct employment, with health and social care and applied science being popular subjects. Recent government plans to streamline post-16 education initially threatened BTec funding to make way for T-levels, but the Labour government has paused and reversed many of these cuts for "key courses." This ensures that a broader range of vocational pathways remains available for students, acknowledging their importance in various sectors.</p>

          <p>As A-level results are released, this article examines the rising costs of UK university education, with annual tuition fees in England and Wales increasing to £9,535 and living expenses continuing to climb. Universities attribute fee increases to funding pressures and inflation, while students face significant debt, averaging £53,000 for recent English graduates. Maintenance loans, though increased, often don't cover full costs, leading more students to work during term time. The article questions the financial return on a degree, noting that while most graduates earn more, real wages have declined, and earnings vary significantly by subject and university.</p>

          <p>Anchorage, Alaska, is experiencing a mix of excitement and trepidation as it prepares to host the Trump-Putin summit. Residents, who often feel distinct from the "lower 48" US, are wary of the implications, with some satirically asking, "Please don’t sell us back," referencing Alaska's history as part of the Russian empire. While some appreciate the city being "back on the map," others express pessimism about potential outcomes. Despite long-standing cultural ties with Russia, there's broad dissatisfaction with Putin's visit due to his international arrest warrant. The summit, likely on a military base, is seen by some as detached from local life.</p>

Younger generations, specifically those aged 18-34, are particularly influenced, showing lower consumption rates and greater belief in alcohol's harm.

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has threatened to sue Hunter Biden for over $1 billion, demanding he retract and apologize for claiming she was introduced to her husband by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers describe Biden's assertion as "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory," causing "overwhelming financial and reputational harm." Biden made the comments during an interview, partially attributing the claim to a journalist whose story was subsequently retracted by The Daily Beast. The First Lady's legal action, mirroring her husband's approach to critics, underscores the lack of evidence supporting the claim and seeks to address its widespread dissemination.</p>

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has denied claims that North Korea removed propaganda loudspeakers along its border, dismissing South Korea's hopes for renewed dialogue. She reiterated Pyongyang's firm disinterest in negotiations with the US and South Korea, citing upcoming joint military drills as evidence of their hostile intentions. This statement directly contradicts Seoul's assessment of de-escalation measures and underscores the continued high tensions on the Korean peninsula. Kim Yo Jong also explicitly ruled out conveying any message to the US through Russian President Vladimir Putin, solidifying North Korea's unyielding stance.</p>

Federal agents have made dozens of arrests, with the White House stating this is "only the beginning" of efforts to pursue criminals.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reports a significant increase in chikungunya virus cases in the UK, with over 70 infections in the first half of this year—more than double the previous year. All cases are linked to travel, primarily from the Indian Ocean region, including India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius, where an outbreak is ongoing. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne virus can cause severe fever and joint pain that may persist for years. The UKHSA is urging travelers to high-risk areas to take precautions against mosquito bites and consider vaccination, as the virus is not transmitted within the UK.</p>

The agreement signifies Australia's strategic efforts to deepen its influence in the Pacific region amidst China's growing presence. While visa-free travel for Vanuatu citizens was discussed, it will be addressed in a separate, unconfirmed subsidiary agreement.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to ease environmental regulations for commercial spaceflight, aiming to substantially increase rocket launches by 2030. This order suggests companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin may bypass extensive environmental reviews mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for FAA launch permits. Environmental groups strongly condemn the move, warning it puts people and wildlife at risk from disruptive launches that can cause explosions, fires, and hazardous material spills, citing past incidents like SpaceX's Starship test that damaged its launchpad and harmed wildlife.
