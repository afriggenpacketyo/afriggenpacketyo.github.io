          <p>During a press conference in Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his feud with London's mayor, calling Sadiq Khan a "nasty person" who has performed poorly in his role. The comments were made during a joint appearance with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who noted that the mayor was a friend of his. A spokesperson for Mayor Khan responded by highlighting London's diversity and suggesting that a record number of Americans have sought British citizenship during Trump's presidency. This exchange continues a long-running public dispute between the two political figures.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Cameroonian politics examines how 92-year-old President Paul Biya has maintained power for over four decades, despite widespread poverty and corruption in the nation. His longevity is attributed to the "Biya system," which involves playing potential rivals against each other, ensuring a fragmented opposition, and maintaining a military structure where no single group is strong enough to stage a coup. With Biya running for an eighth term, many young Cameroonians lack hope for change, as the ruling party's deep-rooted influence makes his re-election likely.</p>

          <p>Restoration artist Sheila Lehman is meticulously repairing the iconic, seven-foot-tall Bob's Big Boy statues at the oldest remaining location of the restaurant chain in Burbank, California. Lehman, who has personal memories of visiting the restaurant in her youth, is carefully refurbishing the damaged figures, including one on the roof that had fallen over. Her passion for restoration began with a smaller project for her church and has since grown into a business where she repairs cherished family heirlooms from across the country, understanding their deep sentimental value.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at his Scottish golf club, President Donald Trump praised UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for taking a stronger stance on curbing illegal immigration across the English Channel, calling it a "fantastic thing." Trump emphasized the importance of preventing people from entering countries illegally, linking it to his own administration's policies which he claimed resulted in zero illegal entries in the last month. Starmer noted his government has facilitated the removal of approximately 35,000 people since taking office, framing it as fulfilling a key campaign promise.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Grand Traverse County, Michigan, are pursuing terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart. The suspect allegedly used a folding knife in the attack, which injured six women and five men before he was confronted by armed citizens in the parking lot who held him until a deputy arrived. While a motive has not yet been determined, all victims are expected to survive, with their conditions reportedly improving at a local medical center where free counseling is being offered.</p>

He then added that based on television coverage, "those children look very hungry," referring to it as "real starvation stuff." Trump's comments, made during a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, appear to contradict the Israeli government's position and come as the UN and other agencies warn of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe and rising deaths from malnutrition in the territory.</p>

          <p>The first trailer for "Avatar: Fire and Ash," the third film in James Cameron's series, has been released, introducing a new Na'vi tribe known as the Mangkwan Clan, or Ash People. Led by the formidable Varang, this clan resides in a volcanic region and appears to be an adversary to Jake Sully and his family, suggesting a more complex narrative that moves beyond a simple human-versus-Na'vi conflict. The trailer also teases another new tribe, the nomadic Wind Traders, and hints at Jake Sully's capture by humans.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Human Immune System Can Be Triggered by Visual Cues of Sickness</h2>

          <p>A new study from Swiss universities suggests that the human immune system can be activated merely by the sight of infection. Researchers used virtual reality to show participants avatars of human faces, some of which appeared sick with rashes or a cough. Blood samples taken from those who viewed the sick-looking avatars showed increased activity of innate lymphoid cells, which are key to the early stages of an immune response. The findings indicate the brain can prime the body for a fight against pathogens based on visual cues alone.</p>

The club's rationale for the sale is to realize a gain of about 75% on the shares and reallocate the capital into other industrial stocks, like Honeywell and Dover, that have lagged but show strong potential.

          <p>NHS England has condemned the British Medical Association (BMA) for its "increasingly hardline" stance in the ongoing resident doctors' strike, accusing the union of risking patient safety. The criticism stems from the BMA's rejection of numerous emergency requests, known as 'derogations,' for striking doctors to return to work in critical situations, including for cancer care. The BMA contends that hospitals are using the system to cover for poor planning and to continue non-urgent care, while the NHS argues a remote panel is dangerously second-guessing frontline clinicians.</p>

          <p>To combat a deepening demographic crisis marked by a third consecutive year of population decline, the Chinese government is introducing a new subsidy program. The policy will offer parents 3,600 yuan (about $500) per year for each child under the age of three. This national initiative follows various provincial-level efforts to encourage child-rearing, as young couples are increasingly deterred by high costs and career concerns.

This decline in new housing, especially in affluent suburbs, is causing housing costs to surge, with cities like Phoenix and Miami beginning to resemble the unaffordable markets of coastal California. The authors warn that this trend suggests "America's suburban frontier appears to be closing," threatening a nationwide affordability crisis. (not investment advice)</p>
