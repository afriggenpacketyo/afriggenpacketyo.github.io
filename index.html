        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill along party lines, marking a significant victory for Republicans. The bill includes permanent extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts and the elimination of taxes on tips. The legislation incorporates various amendments to appease different factions within the Republican party, such as adjusting the timeline for Medicaid work requirements and increasing the SALT deduction cap for certain taxpayers. However, the Congressional Budget Office analysis suggests the bill would disproportionately benefit higher-income households, while negatively impacting those in the lowest income bracket. Markets reacted negatively to the bill's potential impact on federal deficits, increasing concerns about long-term fiscal health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has reportedly achieved a significant advancement in hypersonic engine technology, potentially reviving a concept initially proposed by the US Air Force in 1958. The scientists successfully tested an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber using standard jet fuel. The experiment simulated flight conditions at Mach 8 and an altitude of 18 miles, maintaining stable detonation waves for over two seconds. This research, conducted by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology and Northwestern Polytechnical University, suggests the technical feasibility of ODEs for military applications, despite previous skepticism due to technical challenges.</p>

          <p>The Republican Party is struggling to pass a major tax and spending bill due to internal disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction, which allows Americans to deduct a portion of their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, has become a point of contention, particularly among lawmakers from high-tax states. A deal was reached to raise the cap, but other lawmakers want their priorities fulfilled in the bill. This struggle highlights the complex dynamics within the Republican coalition and the challenges of legislating in a divided Congress.</p>

          <p>Several nations, including those backing Israel in its conflict with Hamas, have condemned Israeli troops for firing 'warning shots' near a delegation of foreign diplomats visiting the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian Authority accused the Israeli military of deliberately targeting the diplomats near Jenin, a city frequently raided by Israeli forces. The Israeli military stated the diplomatic convoy deviated from the approved route into a restricted zone, prompting the warning shots, and expressed regret for the inconvenience. Numerous countries and the UN have demanded an investigation into the incident, which occurred amid rising tensions over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and strained Israel-Europe relations following a recent shooting in Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the UK government may need to raise taxes after borrowing figures for April came in higher than expected. Borrowing reached Â£20.2 billion, marking the fourth-highest April figure since 1993, indicating that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may struggle to meet her fiscal rules. Economists suggest that weaker economic growth will likely impact tax receipts, increasing the pressure on government finances. The prime minister's recent decision to partially reverse cuts to winter fuel payments further complicates the situation, potentially necessitating additional tax increases.</p>

Despite the ruling, the judge did not order the return of the deportees to the United States.

          <p>Israelis reacted with shock and horror to the murder of two staffers at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. Israeli leaders were quick to point fingers at their political opponents, suggesting that they were ultimately responsible for the shooting. Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, called the attack a consequence of "toxic antisemitic incitement against Israel and Jews around the world." Yair Golan, leader of the left-wing Democrats party, blamed Netanyahu's government, while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, suggested leftist politicians encouraged the attack.</p>

          <p>President Trump is proposing a new missile defense system called the "Golden Dome" to protect the U.S. from threats by air and outer space. The system, estimated to cost $175 billion, is modeled after Israel's Iron Dome and aims to be completed by January 2029. Critics have raised concerns about the enormous costs, unrealistic timeframe, and possible involvement of Elon Musk's SpaceX. China has accused Trump of undermining global strategic balance and stability, while Canada has expressed interest in joining the plan.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on the premises of the prime minister's office and other government buildings. The aim is to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, following local opposition to demonstration projects in Tokyo. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would be used for flowerbeds and other purposes. This move is part of Japan's efforts to reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal after the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>
