          <h2>Study Finds Foreign-Owned Firms Responsible for a Quarter of China's Corporate Emissions Over 20 Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 00:00:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study conducted by researchers from several universities has revealed that multinational enterprises contributed to approximately 25% of the total emissions from all companies in China over a two-decade period. The findings, published in Nature Communications, highlight a significant environmental consequence of foreign investment. The research points to a disparity where China's eastern coastal regions reaped more economic benefits, while the central and western inland areas shouldered a heavier environmental burden. This raises new questions about assessing carbon emission responsibilities for foreign-owned corporations operating globally.</p>

          <p>The recent announcement of 39% US tariffs on Swiss exports has sent a significant shock through Switzerland's economy and national identity. For a country built on profitable neutrality and splendid isolation, the move has shattered a long-held sense of exceptionalism and predictability. The tariffs threaten to annihilate sales to the US, Switzerland's most important export market, forcing the nation to confront its vulnerability in an era of aggressive geoeconomics. This has provoked an identity crisis and a re-evaluation of its distant relationship with the European Union.</p>

          <p>China and Cambodia have officially launched a direct air corridor for fresh fruit, marked by the first two-tonne shipment of Cambodian durians arriving in China's Henan province. The use of cold chain logistics ensured the fruit arrived in just four hours, preserving its freshness. Durian is now the fifth Cambodian fruit, after bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts, to gain direct access to the vast Chinese market. This development highlights deepening agricultural trade ties and improved customs efficiency between the two nations, although some industry insiders remain cautious about the fruit's commercial competitiveness.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of bilateral cooperation, Mexico has extradited 26 high-level cartel figures to the United States to face justice. The transfer is part of a major deal with the Trump administration aimed at dismantling powerful drug trafficking networks. Among those handed over is Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the "Los Cuinis" organization closely allied with the notorious CJNG cartel. This move represents a milestone in the US Justice Department's efforts to combat these criminal groups and follows a similar extradition of 29 figures earlier in the year.</p>

It chronicles the prosecution's argument that Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, contrasted with the defense's claim of an elaborate cover-up by law enforcement. The case, which captivated public attention, involved two lengthy trials, a hung jury, and significant legal battles over evidence and witness credibility, culminating in a not-guilty verdict for murder and manslaughter.</p>

The meeting is being framed by the White House as a "listening exercise" and a "feel-out meeting" rather than a session for definitive agreements. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend in person but will meet virtually with Trump and European leaders beforehand.</p>

          <p>US National Guard troops have begun deploying on the streets of Washington D.C. after President Donald Trump ordered their presence and took control of the city's police force, citing concerns over violent crime. The deployment of 800 troops and 500 federal agents has been met with sharp criticism from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called it an "authoritarian push" and denied that crime is out of control. This move has intensified political tensions, with the administration threatening similar actions in other Democratic-led cities while local officials navigate the unprecedented federal intervention.</p>

In stark contrast, survival for melanoma skin cancer is now above 90%.

          <h2>CPR and Defibrillator Questions to be Added to UK Driving Theory Test</h2>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will incorporate questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of defibrillators into the car and motorcycle theory tests starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the 2.4 million learner drivers who take the test annually with basic life-saving skills. Since drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a cardiac arrest, it is hoped that this new requirement will help prevent avoidable deaths by increasing public knowledge of emergency first aid procedures.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged his country's role in using "repressive violence" in Cameroon during its fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's responsibility for events that cost tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 historical report, commissioned by France, which detailed how French colonial troops engaged in mass forced displacement, operated internment camps, and supported brutal militias to suppress the independence movement, with repression continuing even after 1960.</p>

          <p>The risk of contracting a dangerous infection from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, is increasing as ocean temperatures rise due to climate change. The bacteria thrives in warm coastal waters, and cases are now being reported in regions further north, such as the Carolinas and even Connecticut. Health officials warn that the danger is heightened during hurricane season when flooding can bring contaminated water into contact with people. With a mortality rate of one in five for those infected, early recognition of symptoms is critical for survival.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets rallied, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq approaching record highs, after new data showed that inflation in July was slightly better than economists had anticipated. The consumer price index report indicated a 2.7% year-over-year increase, matching June's rate and boosting investor confidence. This has increased speculation that the Federal Reserve will have the leeway to implement an interest rate cut at its September meeting, which would lower borrowing costs and further stimulate the economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's peach harvest is suffering, with some farms reporting up to 30% fewer peaches this year due to the impacts of climate change. Unusually warm winter weather disrupted the essential "sleep cycle" that stone fruit trees require, where they need a certain number of hours below 45 degrees to properly regulate nutrients for the growing season. This has led to lower yields and higher consumer prices, demonstrating a direct and tangible link between a warming climate and the nation's food supply and agricultural economy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested a suspect in the brutal assault of a 70-year-old Sikh man, who was beaten with a golf club and remains in critical condition. The attack occurred near a Sikh temple, and while authorities have not yet classified it as a hate crime, the victim's family and community advocates are urging a full investigation into bias as a motive. Groups like the Sikh Coalition note that elderly men who maintain visible articles of their faith are often targets of violent attacks.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, accusing the tech giant of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. In a post on his social media platform X, Musk alleged that Apple is behaving in a way that makes it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to reach the number one spot. He claims this unfairly disadvantages his own AI chatbot, Grok, and constitutes an "unacceptable security violation." Apple responded that its App Store is designed to be fair and free of bias.</p>
