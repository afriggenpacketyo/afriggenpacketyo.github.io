            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has accused Donald Trump of destabilizing the global trade system through aggressive tariff policies. Brown suggests that these tariffs risk triggering a global economic crisis reminiscent of the 1930s, urging coordinated action from governments and central banks. He advocates for a global rescue plan, including synchronized interest rate cuts, to mitigate the impact of Trump's trade measures. Brown's remarks underscore concerns about the potential for a full-blown financial crisis and the need for international cooperation to restore stability. (not investment advice)</p>
