The development seeks to capitalize on the growing demographic of elderly individuals in Hong Kong, where a significant percentage of seniors prefer living in their own homes but lack professional care options. This initiative reflects a broader trend of cross-border integration within the Greater Bay Area, with a focus on providing specialized services to meet the needs of a specific demographic.

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. While some VCs argue that overwork is necessary to compete globally, many founders emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation and work-life balance. They contend that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through innovation rather than overwork, and that younger generations prioritize work-life balance. Instead of increasing working hours, founders advocate for more funding and resources to enable startups to compete effectively on the global stage.

          <p>A wooden hunters' toolbox inscribed with an ancient writing system from Zambia, Sona or Tusona, is highlighting the role of women in pre-colonial communities and the cultural heritages almost erased by colonialism. Sona, from the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, uses geometric patterns to convey mathematical principles, messages about nature, and instructions on community life. The original custodians and teachers of Sona were women, with community elders still remembering how it works. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is working to document and archive women's histories and indigenous knowledge, aiming to reclaim and understand Zambia's cultural heritage. The article's focus on cultural revival and historical awareness suggests a moderately optimistic outlook.</p>
