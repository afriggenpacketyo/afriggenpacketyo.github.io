          <p>The U.S. has announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% blanket tariff on the country's exports, a reduction from the previously threatened 25%. The agreement includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into U.S.-controlled ventures, although differing interpretations exist between the two nations on how these funds will be utilized. Additionally, Seoul has committed to purchasing $100 billion in American energy products and making further investments, while U.S. goods entering South Korea will not be subject to tariffs, aiming to fortify the economic and diplomatic alliance.

          <p>A group of twelve Democratic members of Congress has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is illegally limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. The complaint argues that the Department of Homeland Security is violating federal law and hindering their constitutional oversight responsibilities by requiring a week's notice for visits. Lawmakers claim these actions prevent them from properly inspecting facility conditions amid the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, which has seen detainee numbers swell. The lawsuit seeks to compel DHS to grant immediate and unfettered access to these facilities as mandated by appropriations law.</p>

          <p>Steve Ricchetti, a close confidante and former counselor to President Joe Biden, underwent a voluntary, eight-hour closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee. The interview is part of a Republican-led investigation into whether White House aides concealed signs of the former president's mental decline. A source described Ricchetti as "combative and defensive," asserting that Biden was fully capable of performing his presidential duties, though he acknowledged the political challenge of his age. Ricchetti also defended Biden's frequent gaffes as common mistakes and denied any involvement in the drafting of his physical evaluation letters, stating he only discussed their presentation with staff.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced a significant decline in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than 50% compared to the previous year and failed to meet market expectations. The South Korean technology giant reported an operating profit of 4.7 trillion won, below the 5.33 trillion won estimated by analysts, despite a slight increase in quarterly revenue to 74.6 trillion won. This steep drop in profitability highlights challenges for the world's leading provider of memory chips and smartphones, even as its revenue figures narrowly surpassed its own forecasts and analyst predictions for the quarter.

Tsunamis are typically generated by strong, shallow, underwater earthquakes with vertical tectonic plate movement, creating long, fast-moving waves that gain height in shallow water. Predicting their exact size and power remains challenging, but deep-ocean sensors have improved forecasting. In the event of a warning, experts advise immediately moving to higher ground—at least 30 to 100 feet above sea level—as the waves are a series of powerful surges, not a single event, and can carry dangerous debris.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed surprisingly abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team observed vast fields of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest that these chemosynthetic communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches, opening new avenues for studying how life adapts to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a significant turnaround in the second quarter, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp reversal from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter. This surge largely reflects a substantial decrease in imports following the implementation of new tariffs, which are subtracted in GDP calculations. While the headline number appears strong, economists caution that it overstates the economy's underlying health, as a key measure of domestic demand rose at its weakest pace since late 2022. The data suggests that while the economy is not in reverse, it is shifting to a lower gear. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 tremor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little widespread tsunami damage. Scientists explain that the tsunami's destructive energy was primarily directed into a sparsely populated area of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii. This trajectory allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated coastlines like California and Oregon. While the area near the epicenter experienced damaging waves, the specific location and directionality of the quake meant that other regions dodged a catastrophic event, representing a best-case scenario for a quake of this magnitude.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's market capitalization surged past $4 trillion in after-hours trading, making it the second company to reach this milestone, following chipmaker Nvidia. The jump was fueled by a stellar earnings report that showed revenue growing at its fastest pace in over three years, largely driven by its Azure cloud business. The company's stock rose over 8% after it disclosed that Azure and other cloud services generated over $75 billion in revenue for the fiscal year. This performance highlights Microsoft's successful capitalization on the artificial intelligence boom, placing it ahead of Apple in the market value rankings. (not investment advice)</p>

For 60 years, he personally seared patties on a vintage griddle, serving generations of San Fernando Valley workers and food pilgrims alike. His passing has prompted an outpouring of admiration from customers and fellow restaurateurs who were inspired by his dedication and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin, in which he alleged malicious prosecution by state officials regarding the fatal 2021 "Rust" film set shooting. Baldwin had sued prosecutors and law enforcement, claiming he was made a celebrity scapegoat after involuntary manslaughter charges against him were dropped last year. The judge dismissed the civil suit due to a lack of significant action in the case over the past six months, though Baldwin's lawyers have 30 days to file a motion to keep it active. The ruling comes as legal proceedings from the tragic incident, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, are concluding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new wave of popular television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" is captivating audiences by inducing anxiety rather than offering escapism. These series use hyperrealistic filmmaking techniques, such as real-time narratives and single-take sequences, to immerse viewers in the high-stakes, mundane pressures of stressful workplaces like kitchens and emergency rooms. This trend marks a shift away from comfort TV, resonating with viewers who may find the depiction of everyday stress cathartic and relatable. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be enjoyable because it provides a risk-free thrill and fosters a strong sense of empathy for the characters.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has criticized the UK government's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing the move "risks rewarding terror." The former hostage, who was abducted on October 7, 2023, stated that such a move sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy and could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages. Her statement echoes concerns from lawyers representing families of British hostages, who fear that making recognition conditional on a ceasefire could prompt Hamas to refuse a deal. They are imploring the UK Prime Minister to provide clarity that Hamas will not be rewarded.</p>

          <p>A technical outage at the UK's national air traffic control service (NATS) caused significant flight disruptions across major airports, including Heathrow and Manchester. Although the radar-related issue lasted only 20 minutes before a back-up system was engaged, it resulted in a huge backlog, with thousands of passengers grounded and over 150 flights cancelled. This is the second major failure for NATS in two years, prompting criticism from airlines and political leaders.

          <p>Recent U.S. legislation promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power is raising questions about America's global competitiveness in the renewable energy sector. Supporters of the new policy argue it is essential for energy independence, aiming to reduce reliance on China's dominance in clean tech manufacturing and critical mineral supply chains. However, critics contend that this strategic pivot prioritizes short-term security over long-term sustainability. They warn that by de-emphasizing renewables, the U.S. risks ceding its leadership role in the global clean energy transition to China, potentially compromising both economic opportunities and global climate goals.

The map redraws districts to dilute Democratic votes in major urban centers and has been criticized for being developed without public input.
