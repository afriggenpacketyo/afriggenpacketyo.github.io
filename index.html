          <p>Michael Madsen, the iconic actor celebrated for his memorable roles in Quentin Tarantino films like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Kill Bill Vol. 2," has passed away at the age of 67.

Throughout his four-decade career, Madsen appeared in over 300 films and television shows, leaving a lasting mark with his distinctive gruff voice and intense screen presence.

          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India has taken firm control over England, largely due to a monumental innings from captain Shubman Gill, who scored 269 runs. This performance set a new record for the highest score by an Indian batter in England. After India posted a massive total of 587, their bowlers quickly dismantled England's top order, leaving the hosts struggling at 77-3 by the close of day two.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has narrowly passed President Trump's signature legislative package in a 218-214 vote, sending the sprawling bill to the White House for his signature.

Republican leaders overcame internal divisions and pressure from the White House to secure the votes after a marathon overnight session.

          <p>President Trump has achieved the first major legislative win of his second term with the passage of his "big, beautiful bill," a sprawling package fulfilling key campaign promises on border security, military spending, and tax cuts. However, the victory carries significant political risks for Republicans. The legislation is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt and will cut Medicaid coverage for nearly 12 million Americans. Democrats are already preparing to campaign on these consequences, setting the stage for a fierce political battle over the bill's true impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the wealthiest 1% of U.S. households will receive the largest benefits from the newly passed Republican tax bill, with the size of the windfall varying by state. The top 1% in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, are projected to see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000. The legislation's structure, which extends 2017 tax cuts and offers breaks for business owners and estates, disproportionately benefits high earners in low-tax states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While President Trump's "one big, beautiful bill" is a significant legislative achievement, history suggests it could lead to a political backlash for the Republican party. Large, partisan bills passed via the budget reconciliation process, which bypasses the filibuster, have a track record of being unpopular and often result in the president's party losing control of Congress in the following midterm elections. This "thermostatic" public response, where opinion moves against the party perceived as going too far, has affected presidents from Reagan to Biden, signaling a potentially short-lived victory for Trump.</p>

          <p>With average credit card interest rates exceeding 21%, many Americans find do-it-yourself payoff plans insufficient for their growing debt. This article outlines five key indicators that it's time to seek professional help, such as only being able to make minimum payments and using credit cards for essential living expenses. Other red flags include having a credit utilization ratio over 50% or a debt-to-income ratio above 40%. When these signs appear, options like credit counseling or debt settlement programs may be necessary to regain financial control. (not investment advice)</p>

The case originated from a BBC story about a neo-Nazi state agent who abused his former partner, where MI5 falsely claimed it had not confirmed his status as an agent.

          <p>Despite vows from moderates not to slash Medicaid and from conservatives not to increase the national debt, nearly all Republican lawmakers united to pass President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." This analysis suggests the bill's passage is less about its policy merits, which are widely unpopular, and more a demonstration of Trump's tight control over the party. Lawmakers from various factions set aside their stated principles and policy demands to meet the president's arbitrary July 4 deadline. The few who resisted, like retiring Senator Thom Tillis, highlighted how the bill broke key promises.</p>
