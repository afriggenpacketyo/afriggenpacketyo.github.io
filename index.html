        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic challenges are preventing young adults from achieving traditional milestones like moving out, marrying, or having children. A U.S. Census Bureau paper highlights a significant decline in these achievements compared to previous generations, with fewer than a quarter of young adults meeting all four key markers. Changing societal norms and the rising cost of living are cited as primary factors, leading many to prioritize education and financial stability over family formation. This shift redefines the modern pathway to adulthood, emphasizing economic independence as a prerequisite for other life events.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo highlighted the positive and unified response from the football community following alleged racist abuse he experienced during a match at Anfield. Despite the distressing incident, Semenyo expressed gratitude for the support from teammates, Liverpool players, fans, and officials, stating that "football showed its best side." The event has prompted renewed calls from figures like Virgil van Dijk and Premier League CEO Richard Masters to intensify efforts to eradicate racism from the sport. Merseyside Police have launched an investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians reacted with concern and disappointment to the ceremonial welcome Russian President Vladimir Putin received from Donald Trump at their summit in Alaska. Many in Kyiv viewed the red carpet and military honors as an inappropriate legitimization of a leader responsible for an ongoing war of aggression. Analysts and citizens expressed that the optics of the event, including friendly gestures and laughter, struck a sour note given the immense suffering in Ukraine. The summit concluded without major strategic agreements, which provided some relief, but the deferential treatment of Putin remains a point of contention.</p>

He emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is scheduled to meet with Trump.

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing significantly in the second quarter, largely driven by its innovative foldable phones. While Apple still holds the top spot, its share has declined, reflecting a renewed rivalry centered on screen technology and form factors. Samsung's wider range of products at various price points, from budget-friendly models to high-end foldables like the Z Fold 7, is challenging Apple's dominance. Analysts suggest Apple may soon respond with its own foldable device to compete in this evolving market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests that building emotional endurance—the capacity to handle stress without being overwhelmed—is crucial for personal growth. She recommends three key steps: using visuals to understand that struggle is part of the learning process, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal narratives, and undertaking small, manageable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort. By viewing challenges as opportunities rather than failures, individuals can better navigate difficult moments. This approach helps transform frustrating experiences into valuable lessons for developing resilience.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has endorsed efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could significantly favor Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. Following a favorable state supreme court ruling, DeSantis and state legislative leaders are planning a "select committee on congressional redistricting" to alter boundaries, potentially targeting districts held by prominent Democrats. DeSantis also supports a proposed mid-decade census that excludes undocumented immigrants, which he believes could grant Florida additional congressional seats. Democrats have condemned the plan as a partisan power grab aimed at silencing voters.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest point since tracking began in 1939. This decline is accompanied by a growing public awareness of the health risks associated with alcohol, with a majority now believing even moderate consumption is unhealthy. The trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where drinking rates have plummeted over the past few decades. While this shift promises significant public health benefits, such as reduced alcohol-related deaths and illnesses, some speculate it may be linked to a broader decline in social interaction.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the American Midwest are grappling with a severe economic squeeze caused by the combined effects of the climate crisis and President Trump's trade policies. Extreme weather patterns, from drought one year to excessive rain the next, have drastically reduced crop yields and increased operating costs. Simultaneously, retaliatory tariffs have caused exports of key crops like soybeans to China to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing domestic prices. This "one-two punch" has created immense financial strain, leaving many farmers in a precarious position despite their continued political support for the administration.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American archaeology student from Florida, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first excavation in the U.K. The find occurred in Redesdale, Northumberland, near the site of a major Roman road, where she was digging as part of a Newcastle University project. The decorative gold piece is believed to have belonged to a high-status individual, as gold was reserved for the elite during the early medieval period. This discovery, along with a similar object found nearby in 2021, suggests the area was significant for ceremonial or religious purposes.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons manufacturer is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by a fiber-optic cable, making them immune to electronic warfare jamming. The company, Fold, aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase that would allow strikes on high-value targets located far behind enemy lines. This innovation responds to the changing nature of the battlefield, where key assets are now positioned further from the front. While longer cables present technical challenges, the development could provide Ukraine with a major tactical advantage.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its influence in Africa's Sahel region by becoming a key military supplier to Burkina Faso, filling a void left by deteriorating security partnerships with Western nations. The Burkinabe junta has received several large consignments of Chinese military hardware in 2024, including fire support vehicles and rocket launch systems from state-owned defense contractor Norinco. This military cooperation is part of a broader modernization plan for Burkina Faso's army as it battles jihadist insurgencies. The move signals a significant geopolitical shift, with China stepping in as a major security partner in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its murder rate falling to the lowest level in half a century. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on identifying and intervening with the small number of individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence. Led by Mayor Brandon Scott, the plan combines targeted social support, such as housing and job training, with the threat of focused law enforcement for those who refuse help. This multi-faceted approach, involving community groups and police, marks a significant turnaround for a city long plagued by high homicide rates.</p>

The national day of action is anchored in Austin, Texas, where Republican lawmakers are pushing a plan that could add five GOP-friendly congressional seats at Donald Trump's request. Organizers argue this is part of a broader strategy to "steal Congress" by rigging maps in key states like Florida and Ohio.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a recent survey found that Americans believe age 27 is the ideal time to start saving for retirement, certified financial planners recommend beginning even earlier to maximize the benefits of compound growth. Experts emphasize that starting in one's early 20s provides a crucial advantage, as the money has more time to grow and can lead to a significantly larger nest egg. Many Americans express regret for not starting to save sooner, often citing late starts and debt as reasons for falling behind on their retirement goals. Early and consistent saving is key to achieving financial security. (not investment advice)</p>
