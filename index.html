          <p>U.S. rare earth and critical mineral mining stocks experienced a significant surge following China's decision to tighten export restrictions on these vital materials. Beijing's new rules, requiring licenses for foreign entities exporting rare earths or utilizing Chinese technology, are seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains. This move has fueled speculation that the Trump administration will increase investment in developing a domestic supply chain, bolstering U.S. industry against China's dominance. The situation highlights ongoing trade tensions and the strategic importance of rare earths for national security and various advanced technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has issued a stark warning about the potential for AI models to be hacked and misused, even suggesting they could "learn how to kill someone" if their safety guardrails are circumvented. He highlighted vulnerabilities like prompt injections and jailbreaking, which allow AI to produce dangerous content. Despite these proliferation risks, Schmidt remains optimistic about AI's broader potential, believing its capabilities will far exceed human abilities over time. He also dismissed concerns of an AI bubble, confident in the technology's long-term economic returns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is set to rule on a lawsuit brought by Illinois and Chicago, aiming to block the federal government's deployment of the National Guard to the state. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues the deployment is unlawful, dangerous, and unconstitutional, particularly citing President Trump's claims of Chicago being "out of control." The federal government asserts presidential authority for the deployment, intended to protect federal agents and ICE facilities. This legal battle underscores a significant dispute over federal versus state authority and the justification for military presence in cities.</p>

          <p>Democrats, including Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, are challenging President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to cities, arguing it's an unlawful intrusion into local authority and invoking "states' rights." This stance marks a notable shift from historical Democratic positions on federalism, prompting Republican accusations of hypocrisy. The article explores the legal and political debate surrounding the president's authority, with ongoing court reviews and the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act. Ultimately, the core issue is whether the president's actions are legal, rather than simply a matter of political consistency.</p>

          <p>While President Trump announced a major breakthrough in the Israel-Hamas conflict with the signing of the "first phase" of a peace plan, this article emphasizes that the war in Gaza is far from over. The agreement, facilitated by mediators in Egypt, involves a ceasefire, hostage release, and Israeli troop pullback, but key details regarding Gaza's demilitarization and future governance remain contentious. The article highlights Trump's strong leverage over Israel and a new sense of urgency among Arab states following a failed Israeli strike in Doha.

          <p>India's top football league, the Indian Super League (ISL), is at a critical juncture following a Supreme Court order for an open tender of its commercial rights, ending a decade-long exclusive deal. This governance crisis has stalled the 2025–26 season, revealing deep structural issues within Indian football where politics often intertwines with administration. Critics argue the ISL has disconnected from grassroots development, despite a surge in youth participation. Experts believe a reset is necessary, advocating for professionalism, transparency, and the reintroduction of promotion and relegation to create a sustainable league.</p>

          <p>California is set to become the first U.S. state to phase out certain ultra-processed foods from school meals over the next decade. Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law requiring the state to define and then ban these foods, typically high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, from school breakfasts and lunches by 2035. This initiative builds on California's prior efforts in school nutrition, including free meals for all students and banning synthetic food dyes. Proponents emphasize the health benefits for children, while some critics express concerns about implementation costs and potential food access limitations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent threats to withhold back pay from furloughed federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown are adding significant stress to public servants. Despite a law requiring retroactive pay, Trump suggested some employees "don't deserve to be taken care of." This comes amidst broader attacks on career public servants and threats of mass layoffs, framed by the administration as an opportunity to reduce the workforce. Legal scholars deem these actions illegal, and Democrats are relying on court intervention while negotiating healthcare tax credits. The situation deeply discourages future federal service, impacting the government's long-term workforce pipeline.</p>

          <p>The debate over abolishing UK stamp duty is intensifying, with potential significant consequences for the housing market. Analysts suggest that while scrapping the tax might initially lead to house price increases due to greater demand, it could also improve market mobility for buyers and downsizers. However, such a move would primarily benefit wealthier individuals and those in southern England, as a large proportion of first-time buyers are already exempt. Abolishing stamp duty would also create a substantial gap in public finances, potentially necessitating tax rises elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>
