            <h2>Consumer Confidence Plummets Amid Inflation Concerns in April</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 10:22:07 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A University of Michigan survey revealed a sharp decline in consumer sentiment for April, driven by escalating inflation fears, with expected inflation reaching levels not seen since 1981. The survey's mid-month reading fell to 50.8, significantly below expectations and prior months. This decline spanned across all demographics, signaling widespread concern. The survey director, Joanne Hsu, warned of multiple recession warning signs, including deteriorating expectations for business conditions, personal finances, and labor markets, highlighting rising unemployment fears not seen since 2009. The survey, conducted between March 25 and April 8, also occurred before President Trump announced a 90-day pause on aggressive tariffs against several U.S. trading partners.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Analysts have speculated on the potential cost of manufacturing an iPhone entirely in the United States, a concept spurred by President Trump's ambition to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. While Apple has not endorsed this idea, experts suggest that labor costs alone could increase the price of an iPhone 16 Pro by 25%, potentially reaching $1,500, while others estimate it could cost as high as $3,500. The primary challenges include the higher cost of American labor, the lack of skilled tooling engineers, and the logistical complexities of importing components. Despite past efforts, such as Foxconn's failed Wisconsin plant, the feasibility of a U.S.-made iPhone remains highly uncertain, with analysts citing the need for significant investment and infrastructure development. </p>

            <p>The British Parliament has been recalled to debate emergency legislation aimed at preventing the imminent closure of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe. The proposed Steel Industry (Special Measures) Bill would grant ministers the authority to direct English steel companies, ensuring the preservation of critical steelmaking capabilities and public safety at the Lincolnshire site. This action follows financial losses reported by Jingye, the Chinese company that acquired British Steel in 2020, and aims to explore all available options for the plant's future and safeguard the livelihoods of its employees. Industry body UK Steel has warned that ceasing production at the Scunthorpe site would result in the UK losing vital steelmaking capabilities.</p>

            <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Trump, encouraged Americans to invest in stocks, a day after dismissing market declines caused by tariff concerns. Navarro anticipates market gains from Trump's tax cuts and potential trade agreements, despite the S&P 500 index being significantly below its value from the start of Trump's term. He argued that stock losses are only on paper unless investors sell, echoing sentiments from Trump and other officials who have emphasized the stock market's performance amidst volatility.

This action is part of a broader effort to reduce the department's size and return education decisions to the states. Critics, including the NAACP, have condemned the layoffs as illegal, arguing they circumvent civil service protections and harm dedicated federal workers and the communities they serve.

The firms' actions come as Trump has launched attacks on DEI programs and the legal profession, including executive orders targeting firms with connections to political rivals.

            <p>The UK is expecting its hottest day of the year, with temperatures potentially reaching 24C in some areas. The warm weather coincides with continued warnings from fire services about the increased risk of wildfires due to low rainfall. London Fire Brigade reported a significant increase in calls compared to the previous year, while fire services in Northern Ireland and Scotland are also battling numerous wildfires. Despite the warm daytime temperatures, nights have remained chilly, and the forecast indicates a shift towards rain and cooler conditions over the weekend.</p>

            <p>Carmakers are making progress in automated driving technology, with Mercedes-Benz aiming to offer autonomous driving up to 95 km/h in some vehicles by 2025. The automotive industry categorizes automated driving into five levels, ranging from assisted to fully autonomous. Level 3 automation, where the vehicle takes over driving tasks under defined conditions, presents significant technical challenges, including the need for redundant safety systems. Industry experts anticipate that automated driving in urban areas will become more prevalent by the end of the decade, but the technology remains expensive and requires further development.</p>

            <p>Bartering offers a resourceful way to obtain goods and services without using cash, fostering community and reciprocity. Experienced traders suggest identifying skills and goods that others may value, such as homemade items, food, or professional services. Finding individuals willing to trade involves reaching out to neighbors, friends, or community groups. Creating a fair exchange requires open communication and a mutual understanding of the value of the goods or services being traded, with long-term bartering relationships often involving a spirit of generosity and reciprocation.</p>

            <p>As the Trump administration implements tariffs, U.S. companies are scrambling to manage the added costs, with some introducing "tariff surcharges" for consumers. Businesses, ranging from small boutiques to established brands, are raising prices and alerting consumers to brace for increased costs. Some companies are using these surcharges to be transparent with their customers, while others are leveraging the situation to create promotional sales. Consumers are facing higher prices on imported goods, which has led some to stockpile items in anticipation of further price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is appealing for early release from prison, arguing that his segregation is negatively impacting his mental health.

His legal team is presenting evidence of complex post-traumatic stress disorder and ADHD. The Solicitor General contends that his conditions are manageable within the prison and that he continues to defy the court order. A ruling on the appeal will be made at a later date.</p>

The advocates claim the order has forced them to cease assisting the ICC due to fears of criminal prosecution and civil fines. The lawsuit contends that the order violates the First Amendment by restricting their right to share information with the ICC. The lawsuit seeks a declaration that Trump's order violates the First Amendment and a prevention of the government from enforcing speech restrictions imposed by the order.</p>

            <p>With inflation persistent, saving money can be a challenge. Certificate of Deposits (CDs) can help, because today's leading accounts come with higher returns than the current inflation rate. Depending on your CD type, terms and other details, there's a varying range of CD rates you can qualify for today. Online banks and online divisions of larger banks have fewer overhead costs to keep up their day-to-day operations, since there are no physical bank branches. Typically these are the banks with rates that have kept up with Fed changes over the past several years. (not investment advice)</p>
