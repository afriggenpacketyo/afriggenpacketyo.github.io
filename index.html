          <p>A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 46-year-old woman was found with fatal stab wounds at a house in Stoke Newington, east London, following a suspected gas explosion. Emergency services were called to the scene after reports of a blast and a person trapped inside the terraced house. The man, who was also taken to hospital with slash wounds, is not in life-threatening condition, according to the Met Police. Two children, ages seven and nine, were also hospitalized as a precaution, though they were not believed to be inside the property at the time of the incident, with investigations ongoing and additional patrols in the area.</p>

Frontline, the shipping company managing the Front Eagle, stated that immediate action was taken to extinguish a fire on deck and that they are cooperating with authorities. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital maritime entry point for oil, and concerns have grown about potential disruptions due to escalating regional tensions between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early to address the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, following a dire warning posted on social media about evacuating Tehran. Meanwhile, Vance Boelter faces federal and state murder charges in Minnesota for the killings of a state lawmaker and her spouse, as well as the wounding of another lawmaker and his wife. Separately, Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family reached a $7.4 billion settlement with all 50 states and U.S. territories over the company's improper marketing of opioids, which includes a provision allowing individuals harmed by OxyContin to pursue civil lawsuits against the Sackler family.</p>

          <p>Experts are questioning the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed gold Trump phone can be made entirely from American components. An industry analyst stated that it would be "virtually impossible" to build the handset, retailing at $499, in the United States. The phone will come with a mobile service costing $47.45 per month, and the Trump family has not yet disclosed which company would manufacture the phone in the US. The announcement has raised ethical concerns, as critics suggest the venture could allow President Trump to personally profit while in office.</p>

          <p>A new book, *Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company*, explores how Apple's deep entanglement with China helped transform the country into a manufacturing powerhouse. The company's decision to outsource manufacturing to China, particularly through its partnership with Foxconn, led to significant investment and training of the Chinese workforce. This shift not only benefited Apple by providing cheaper and more efficient production but also inadvertently contributed to China's economic and technological rise. The book raises questions about whether Apple's pursuit of profit may have inadvertently strengthened one of America's biggest adversaries.</p>

          <p>Budget retail chain Poundland will close 68 stores as part of a turnaround plan under its new ownership by US investment firm Gordon Brothers. The company also plans to close a distribution center in Darton, South Yorkshire, and its national distribution center in Bilston, West Midlands. Additionally, Poundland is seeking rent reductions from landlords, which could lead to approximately 70 more store closures in the future, though the restructuring plan requires court approval.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wanted a "real end" to the conflict between Israel and Iran, and not just a ceasefire, in remarks made in seeming response to a statement by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the US had initiated a ceasefire proposal. Trump added that he wanted a "complete give-up" by Iran, while also rejecting the idea that he was seeking peace talks to resolve the Israel-Iran conflict. His remarks come amid the recent repositioning of US warships and military aircraft in the region.</p>
