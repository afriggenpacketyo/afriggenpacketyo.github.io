          <p>Jen Pawol made history by becoming the first female umpire to officiate a Major League Baseball regular-season game, working at first base during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut was celebrated by family and friends, and she received a warm reception from players and fans. Following the game, the 48-year-old donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Pawol's promotion comes after years of umpiring in the minor leagues, and her achievement has been praised by MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred as a testament to her dedication.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military operation in Gaza City, stating it is essential for defeating the remaining Hamas strongholds. He asserted that Israel's goal is to demilitarize the enclave and install a non-Israeli civilian administration, not to permanently occupy it. The plan has drawn international condemnation over fears of worsening the humanitarian crisis and endangering the remaining hostages. Amid the diplomatic tensions, an Israeli strike near Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly killed four Al Jazeera journalists, an event which the Israeli military addressed by claiming one of the journalists was a Hamas operative.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-4 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays after their bullpen gave up a late-game lead. Relievers Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia allowed three solo home runs in the final two innings, nullifying a strong start by Tyler Glasnow and a solid offensive performance by Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers' offense struggled with runners in scoring position, leaving the bases loaded in both the eighth and ninth innings and stranding 16 runners total. The loss narrows the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just two games over the San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner publicly responded to a social media user who criticized her for attending an Oasis concert without her two children. Turner pointed out the existence of shared custody arrangements with her ex-husband, Joe Jonas, suggesting the children were with their father. The exchange occurred on a post where Turner shared photos from the concert, and her witty clap-back received significant support from her followers. The article notes this follows her and Jonas's finalized divorce and a period where Turner felt unfairly portrayed in the media as a bad mother.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old man from New York, identified as Kevin Mares, was shot and killed in the La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mares was visiting the island with friends to attend one of Bad Bunny's highly anticipated residency concerts. According to police, he was an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire when an argument between other individuals escalated into a shooting, which also injured two local men. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about isolated violence in the historically troubled but increasingly popular tourist area, which gained fame from the song "Despacito."</p>

Export control experts note that such a revenue-sharing deal to obtain licenses is unheard of. Nvidia stated it complies with government rules, while the Trump administration has not yet specified how the collected funds will be used.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European leaders, including those from the EU, France, Germany, and the UK, issued a joint statement emphasizing that a lasting peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. This declaration comes as President Trump plans a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which currently excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While the White House has indicated openness to a three-way summit, the meeting remains one-on-one at Putin's request. The European statement supports Ukraine's territorial integrity and insists that the current line of contact should be the starting point for any negotiations.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England find jobs within the National Health Service (NHS). The plan aims to simplify regulations, allowing NHS trusts to hire graduates based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise, addressing a situation where there are more graduates than available positions. Nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the initiative but stressed that its success depends on actual job creation. However, NHS Providers, representing trusts, raised concerns about how these new measures would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <h2>BBC Report: Israeli Settlers Escalate Efforts to Displace West Bank Palestinians</h2>

          <p>A report from the BBC's Jeremy Bowen details an intensified campaign by Israeli settlers to drive Palestinians from their land in the occupied West Bank, a situation that has accelerated since the October 7th attacks. The article features an interview with a settler leader who openly states that Palestinians have no future in the area and celebrates their departure. Human rights groups and UN experts have documented a systemic pattern of violence, intimidation, and destruction of livelihoods, often with the implicit or explicit support of Israeli security forces. The report argues this pressure is part of a broader agenda to expand settlements and eliminate hopes for a Palestinian state.</p>

          <h2>Historian Rana Mitter Discusses the Underestimated Impact of World War II on Modern China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, argues that the impact of World War II on the nation is frequently underestimated in both China and the West. In this article, he explains that Japan's invasion during the war was a pivotal event that shaped contemporary Chinese politics, society, and culture. According to Mitter, the conflict effectively destroyed the infrastructure and communications networks that had been built in the 1920s and 1930s. This devastation forced China to essentially start over in its development after the war concluded, profoundly influencing its subsequent trajectory.</p>

          <p>A large fire broke out on Arthur's Seat, the prominent hill in the center of Edinburgh, Scotland, during one of the city's busiest festival weekends. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service dispatched multiple crews to tackle the rapidly spreading gorse blaze, and police urged the public to avoid the area. Smoke billowed across the city, and a large section of Holyrood Park was closed to pedestrians. While there were no reported casualties, the incident follows a series of wildfire warnings across Scotland, which has experienced an unusually warm and dry summer, contributing to water scarcity conditions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has overturned a Trump administration directive, ruling that commercial fishing remains illegal in the expanded areas of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The decision blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had allowed fishing in waters protected by President Obama in 2014. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration bypassed the required public comment process for changing the rules. The ruling is being celebrated as a major victory for the protection of the monument's unique and vulnerable marine ecosystems and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed was the star performer as Trent Rockets secured a five-wicket victory over the Northern Superchargers, continuing their undefeated start in the men's Hundred cricket tournament.

He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase, which the Rockets completed with four balls remaining. Despite a mid-innings wobble against the Superchargers' spinners, the Rockets' depth saw them comfortably to their target.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturer Nvidia has pushed back against allegations from Chinese state media that its H20 artificial intelligence chips represent a national security risk for China. An article affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV claimed the chips were not advanced and contained a hardware "backdoor" that could allow for remote shutdown. Nvidia issued a strong denial, stating its chips do not have backdoors and that cybersecurity is critically important. The dispute marks an escalation in tensions over U.S. export controls, even as Nvidia has resumed shipping the H20 chips, which were specifically designed to comply with those controls, to China.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man survived a perilous ride on the outside of a high-speed train in Austria after it departed a station without him. The incident occurred in Sankt Poelten when the man, who had reportedly stepped onto the platform for a cigarette break, grabbed onto the space between two carriages as the train pulled away. Passengers noticed him banging on the windows, prompting the conductor to perform an emergency stop. Railway officials condemned the act as incredibly irresponsible, noting such actions are usually fatal, before the man was taken aboard and later met by police in Vienna.</p>
