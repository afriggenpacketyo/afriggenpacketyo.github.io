          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling blocking the Trump administration's policy to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the United States. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's order pauses a January directive that sought to apply this process, previously limited to border areas, to individuals anywhere in the country who arrived within the last two years. The court cited significant due process concerns, arguing that the government must provide adequate legal protections for those affected by such a broad application of the policy. This decision represents a considerable challenge to the administration's immigration enforcement agenda, although the Department of Homeland Security has indicated its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>South Korea has officially indicted Kim Keon Hee, the nation's former first lady and wife of impeached ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol, on charges including bribery and market manipulation. The indictment alleges she accumulated over $720,000 through illicit activities, including a stock manipulation scheme and receiving undeclared political funds and bribes from the Unification Church. These legal actions stem from President Lee Jae Myung's approval of investigations into the previous administration, which Yoon had attempted to block while in office. The developments highlight an ongoing political and legal reckoning in South Korea, drawing international attention, including an initial strong reaction from U.S. President Trump regarding related raids.</p>

          <p>A significant political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying across the United States, with California, Texas, and Missouri at its epicenter, directly influencing the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas initiated the conflict by redrawing districts to create five new Republican-leaning seats, prompting California to respond by aiming to add five Democratic seats. Missouri subsequently joined, seeking to secure an additional Republican seat. This 'political arms race' is driven by President Trump's push for Republican-controlled states to manipulate district lines to maintain control of the House of Representatives.

          <h2>Military Live-Fire Training Identified as Cause for Hundreds of UK Wildfires</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of wildfires have been ignited across the UK countryside since 2023 due to live-fire military training, with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) land accounting for a significant portion. A major challenge in combating these blazes is the presence of unexploded ordnance from past training, particularly in 'Range Danger Areas,' which makes it too hazardous for fire crews to intervene directly. This forces fires to burn themselves out, leading to extensive smoke, road closures, and health concerns for nearby residents. Local communities are urging the MoD to implement stricter controls, including banning live-fire exercises during dry periods and clearing historical munitions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a ruling blocking the Trump administration's efforts to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelan migrants residing in the U.S. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's decision, concluding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the statutory authority to revoke a previous TPS extension. The court emphasized that Congress designed the TPS program to be predictable and insulated from political shifts, ensuring stability for beneficiaries. While the Department of Homeland Security has vowed to appeal this decision, it offers a potential pathway to reverse the administration's actions, though the immediate impact on those whose protections have already lapsed remains uncertain.</p>

Conversely, Ellis claims the rapper attacked her, causing a 'hyper-sensitive' scar on her cheek. The trial has garnered significant online attention, with Cardi B's animated responses and a lawyer's questioning about her wigs and nails becoming viral moments.

Pritzker has vehemently criticized reports of the Trump administration planning to deploy military forces to Chicago, labeling such a move an 'invasion' and an 'attack on the American people.'

The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker over Chicago's crime rate. This controversy mirrors previous federal deployments of the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., which also faced significant pushback from local officials and legal challenges concerning federal authority over state military assets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unilaterally canceled $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding, announcing that money for 15 international programs would be withheld. This action was executed via a 'pocket rescission,' a rarely used procedure that effectively bypasses congressional approval by allowing funds to expire before lawmakers can intervene. The move has drawn strong condemnation from Democrats and even some moderate Republicans, who argue it is illegal and undermines Congress's constitutional authority over spending. Critics warn that this tactic could exacerbate budget negotiations, potentially leading to a federal shutdown, and further diminish the impact of U.S. humanitarian efforts, particularly USAID, which has faced significant reductions under the administration.</p>

          <p>CVS and Walgreens are now implementing restrictions on COVID-19 vaccine access in several states, either requiring a prescription or ceasing to offer the vaccines entirely, in adherence to specific state guidelines.

Consequently, CVS cannot administer vaccines even with a prescription in states such as Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico.

While critics largely lauded Roberts' performance, opinions were sharply divided on the film's overall message and its handling of the sensitive subject matter. Some found its moral ambiguity problematic, questioning whether it truly advances the discourse on sexual assault, despite the filmmakers' intent to explore human motivations and the concept of unreliable narrators.</p>

The research, which analyzed nearly 10,000 health records, found that 68% of these children received medication before age seven, with a significant 42% getting prescriptions within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines typically advocate for behavioral intervention as the initial treatment approach due to potential side effects associated with early medication, such as irritability and aggression.
