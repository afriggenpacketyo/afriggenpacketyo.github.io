          <p>Moody's Ratings has removed the final major Triple-A credit rating for the U.S. federal government, citing bipartisan failures to address the growing budget deficit. The move raises concerns about the country's fiscal path and the willingness of investors to buy Treasury debt without higher interest rates. This article warns that politicians are using accounting tricks to mask the true cost of tax cuts, potentially leading to a financial crisis. The downgrade underscores the urgent need for Washington to address the nation's debt and spending situation. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how nine major corporate law firms have agreed to provide free legal services to the Trump administration, essentially becoming subsidiaries of it. The firms capitulated to avoid federal sanctions, but now face the prospect of being forced to advocate for policies they oppose. Jeffrey Toobin argues that this situation highlights Trump's ability to dominate and demean his adversaries. The article suggests that universities are next in line for similar tactics, drawing a parallel between capitulating to Trump and borrowing from a loan shark. </p>
