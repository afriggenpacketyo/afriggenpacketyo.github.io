          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully extracted rubidium chloride from salt lake brine on a commercial scale, reducing China's reliance on imports. The new method produces 99.9% pure rubidium chloride from potassium chloride material with a low rubidium concentration of just 0.001%. Rubidium is a strategically important metal used in electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace, with applications ranging from improving solar cell performance to use in atomic clocks and medical research. This breakthrough provides a new domestic source for this vital material for emerging industries. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump called on Iran to reach a nuclear deal "before there is nothing left" after Israel launched airstrikes targeting Tehran's nuclear program. The airstrikes hit Tehran and Natanz, with the International Atomic Energy Agency reporting no impact on Iran's Isfahan nuclear site and no increase in radiation levels at the Natanz site. Iranian media reported that Hossein Salam, commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was killed during the attacks, although this has not been independently verified.

The government defended the policy, stating it would raise Â£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30 to improve standards in the state sector.

          <p>House Republicans' reconciliation legislation, dubbed the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill,' includes proposals like investment 'Trump Accounts' for newborns and an enhanced child tax credit, but it may reduce aid for children in low-income families. The bill's emphasis on work requirements could lead to a loss of about $1,600 per year for households in the lowest income decile due to reductions in in-kind transfers. An enhanced child tax credit excludes millions of children from low-income families, and new red tape for the earned income tax credit may prevent some eligible families from receiving the benefit. Proposed cuts to SNAP could affect food assistance for over 2 million children, and changes to Medicaid could impact families' access to healthcare. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>

          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of taking apart buildings for reusable materials, is gaining traction as a climate solution. This approach reduces waste in landfills and shrinks the carbon footprint of buildings. Cities like Portland and Boulder are leading the way, but lack of infrastructure and higher costs can be barriers to wider adoption. A successful deconstruction program requires local processing facilities, distribution channels, and end markets for salvaged materials. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing a "Cloudburst Management Plan" to mitigate increased rainfall due to climate change, which is costing $1.3 billion. The city is constructing underground tunnels to hold excess rainwater and transforming green areas into "sponge parks" to collect and store water. Copenhagen has also broken ground on a human-made island to protect against storm surges, which are expected to be completed by 2070. The city's long-term climate adaptation planning has gained admirers among urban planners throughout the world. The optimism score for this article is 80.</p>
