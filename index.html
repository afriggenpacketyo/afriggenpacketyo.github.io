          <p>As some certificates of deposit (CDs) are set to mature in November, savers are advised to act proactively in a shifting interest rate environment. With the Federal Reserve having recently cut its benchmark rate, CD yields are beginning to soften from their 2023 highs. The article suggests that account holders should review their bank's maturity notices, shop around for competitive rates on new CDs or high-yield savings accounts, and consider whether the liquidity of a savings account might be more beneficial than locking into a new, potentially lower-yield CD.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, homeowners with high mortgage rates are evaluating refinancing options. While experts often suggest refinancing for a full percentage point drop, even a smaller reduction could be beneficial for those who purchased homes after 2022. Current average 30-year refinance rates are around 6.51%, and options like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or buying mortgage points could secure even lower rates for homeowners. With more Fed cuts anticipated, the environment for refinancing may become increasingly favorable in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Trump administration immigration official testified in federal court regarding plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly removed earlier this year despite having protected status. The official stated that the U.S. has been in discussions with several nations, including Eswatini and Ghana, to accept Abrego Garcia, though no final agreement is in place. His lawyers are challenging his prolonged detention, arguing it is illegal since there is no clear prospect for his removal, following a Supreme Court precedent against indefinite detention.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems military explosives plant in Hickman County, Tennessee, has resulted in multiple deaths and left several people unaccounted for. The "devastating" blast, which occurred Friday morning, scattered debris and damaged vehicles, with continuing small detonations initially hindering rescue efforts. The facility develops and manufactures explosives for military and commercial use, and authorities have stated that the investigation into the cause of the incident could take several days.</p>

          <p>Chicha music, a uniquely Peruvian genre, represents a complex fusion of cultural identity, born from the mass migrations of Andean Indigenous peoples to Lima. The sound blends Colombian cumbia, Cuban guaracha, Andean huayno, and psychedelic rock, with the electric guitar as its centerpiece, pioneered by artists like Manzanita and Los Destellos. While the term "chicha" itself has been controversial, the music became a powerful voice for marginalized migrant communities in the 1980s through icons like Chacalón, and its cultural resonance continues to thrive in Peru's capital today.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a "massive increase" in tariffs on Chinese goods in response to Beijing's new restrictions on rare-earth mineral exports. China, which dominates the global supply of these critical materials used in defense and technology manufacturing, now requires special approval for products containing even trace amounts of its rare earths. Trump described the move as "very hostile" and suggested it could also jeopardize a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, escalating trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is centered on a dispute over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a law that remains controversial despite its unheralded successes. The article argues that the ACA effectively expanded health coverage to millions and helped slow the growth of national health spending, yet these benefits are often invisible to the public amid broader affordability crises. The political battle highlights the deep ideological divisions over the law, even as it has demonstrably improved key aspects of the nation's dysfunctional healthcare system.</p>

          <p>The White House has accused the Nobel Committee of prioritizing "politics over peace" after it awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan activist María Coria Machado instead of President Donald Trump. A White House spokesperson asserted that Trump deserved the award for his role in brokering the Gaza ceasefire deal and other diplomatic efforts. President Trump has long expressed a desire for the prize, and the administration's reaction highlights its frustration with the decision, framing it as a politically motivated slight.</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, a free speech group affiliated with Columbia University, has won a significant legal victory against the Trump administration.

The institute's defiant stance contrasts sharply with Columbia University's own more submissive approach, which included a settlement with the administration over antisemitism claims, creating a notable tension between the two affiliated organizations.</p>

          <p>Governor Newsom has signed Senate Bill 79, a historic law designed to address California's housing crisis by increasing housing density near public transit. The bill overrides local zoning laws in eight counties, including Los Angeles, to permit taller and denser residential buildings near subway, light rail, and dedicated bus lane stops. This ambitious reform is seen as a significant victory for housing advocates who argue that building more homes near transit is crucial for affordability, reducing commute times, and cutting car pollution.</p>
