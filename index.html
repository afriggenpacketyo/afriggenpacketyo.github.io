          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack. Judge Gordon Gallagher issued the order to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case, citing the potential for irreparable harm if the family were deported without due process. A hearing on a request for a temporary restraining order is scheduled for June 13 in Denver. This action follows concerns raised by the Colorado secretary of state, who described the Boulder attack as bearing the hallmarks of a hate crime. The judge determined that immediate intervention was necessary given the urgency of the situation. The judge's ruling prevents federal immigration officials from removing the family from the country or the state while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has warned that Russian President Putin will seek revenge for the recent Ukraine drone attack on Russian airfields. This warning came after a phone call between Trump and Putin, their first conversation since the attack. Trump stated that Putin expressed strongly his intent to respond to the attack, which targeted missile-carrying aircraft inside Russia. Russian officials have indicated that military options are under consideration as a response. The call also included discussions about restoring cooperation between the two countries, with both leaders acknowledging the potential for collaboration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented increased tariffs on aluminum and steel, raising them to 50%. Experts predict that this move could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer products, including cars, homes, and household appliances. While some of the nation's largest steelmakers have seen gains, economists warn that businesses will likely pass on the increased costs to consumers. The tariffs, initially imposed at 25% in February, aim to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations for these metals. The tariffs could significantly impact manufacturing costs across various sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed 2.5 million retroactive payments for public pension holders who were previously restricted from receiving full benefits due to the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO).

Beneficiaries should have received a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March 2025, with increased monthly benefits starting in April. The SSA expects to update all beneficiary records by November 2025, and those who haven't received payments should verify their information with the agency. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukraine claims the attack destroyed 41 military bombers, inflicting over $7 billion in damage, though Russia disputes these figures. The attacks occurred as delegates from both countries met in Istanbul for peace negotiations. The images provide visual confirmation of the extent of the damage inflicted by the drone strike.</p>

          <p>A federal court has proposed a novel approach to counter President Trump's actions that have effectively stripped federal civil servants of their job protections. With the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) unable to function due to vacancies, the court suggests that federal courts should step in to hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal workers vulnerable.

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone attack on military airfields inside Russia has highlighted the vulnerability of even the most advanced militaries to inexpensive drone technology. The mission, called Operation Spiderâ€™s Web, destroyed strategic bombers and marked a shift in modern warfare. The attack serves as a reminder that military bases and headquarters worldwide are at risk from similar asymmetric attacks. The innovative use of readily available technology is likely to inspire other such attacks against well-funded adversaries. The author emphasizes that the best defense is peace, as people will always find tactics to thwart military projects.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to perform emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The previous guidance mandated that doctors perform abortions in emergency departments, even in states where the procedure is illegal, if it serves as a stabilizing medical treatment. HHS and CMS stated that the rescinded guidance and accompanying letter from former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra "do not reflect the policy of this Administration." The administration maintains that EMTALA will continue to protect individuals seeking emergency care, including pregnant women.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, once an insider in the Trump administration, has publicly attacked President Trump's signature tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination." Musk's opposition, citing concerns over the bill's impact on the national debt, could embolden Republican budget hardliners in the Senate. This criticism could make it more difficult for Trump to secure the necessary votes for the bill's passage. The White House is reportedly attributing Musk's stance to the bill's cuts in green energy subsidies and the president's decision to pull the nomination of a Musk ally to head NASA.

          <p>Congressional forecasters estimate that President Trump's tariffs could reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade, assuming they remain in place. This projection could offset the increased deficit expected from a recent budget bill passed by the House. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) notes that there are significant uncertainties in this forecast, including the potential for tariffs to discourage imports more than expected. The CBO also projects that the tariffs will lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision, especially during Pride month, is seen as an insult to the LGBTQ+ community. Cleve Jones, a friend of Milk, dismissed the renaming as a distraction from more serious issues. Elected officials, including Nancy Pelosi and Gavin Newsom, have condemned the move as a shameful attempt to erase the contributions of LGBTQ+ people.
