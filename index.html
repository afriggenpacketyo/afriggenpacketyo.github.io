          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 16:18:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gap's fiscal second-quarter revenue missed analyst expectations, leading to a more than 10% drop in its shares during after-hours trading. Although Banana Republic, Gap, and Old Navy experienced comparable sales growth, the Athleta brand significantly underperformed with a 9% decline, dragging down overall company performance. CEO Richard Dickson noted Athleta had strayed from its distinctive performance roots, focusing on new customers at the expense of its core base. The company revised its fiscal 2025 tariff cost projections upwards but maintained its net sales growth outlook, signaling a year of reset for Athleta. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation impacting seniors' finances and Medicare often not covering full medical expenses, many older adults seek ways to fill insurance gaps. This article explores three primary options: Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap), reverse mortgages, and annuities. Medigap covers out-of-pocket costs like copays and deductibles, while reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62+ to access home equity without immediate repayments. Annuities provide consistent future monthly payments in exchange for an upfront lump sum, ensuring a reliable income source for ongoing medical needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel's CFO David Zinser confirmed the semiconductor giant received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, an investment stemming from the White House's decision to acquire a 10% stake in the company. Zinser also hinted at the possibility of seeking external investment for Intel's foundry unit, which produces computer chips for other firms and has been a source of recent investor concern. Despite the cash infusion, the White House indicated the deal's details are still "being ironed out," and Intel had previously cautioned about potential "adverse reactions" from various stakeholders due to the government's involvement.

          <p>The Air Force has decided to extend full military funeral honors to Senior Airman Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. This decision reverses a previous denial by Biden administration Air Force leadership in February 2021 and follows a nearly $5 million wrongful death settlement with Babbitt's family. The move has drawn both praise from figures like General Michael Flynn, who saw it as a leader's proper action, and strong criticism from former Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Capitol Police officer Aquilino Gonell, who argue it dishonors her service and those injured on January 6.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade, a move that could significantly influence Liverpool's pursuit of Alexander Isak. Woltemade, a 23-year-old German international, is expected to undergo a medical, with the fee potentially setting a new club record. This acquisition might encourage Liverpool to revisit their £110m bid for Isak, which Newcastle previously rejected, as the Magpies had stated a need for two quality strikers before considering selling Isak. Woltemade's impressive performance and potential make him a key figure in Newcastle's strategy.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock dipped despite reporting better-than-expected earnings, as investors grappled with robust AI demand offset by ongoing uncertainty in the China market.

          <p>Nvidia's financial filing revealed that two undisclosed "direct customers" accounted for 39% of its second-quarter revenue, raising concerns about client concentration. "Customer A" made up 23% and "Customer B" 16% of total revenue, a significant increase from the previous year. While Nvidia's data center business, primarily serving large cloud service providers, drove 88% of overall revenue, the identities of these top direct customers remain a mystery. Analysts are closely monitoring cloud capital expenditure commitments to forecast Nvidia's future growth, highlighting the importance of understanding this customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Americans are increasingly staying in their current jobs as the U.S. labor market experiences a significant slowdown, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis. The rate of job changes has declined from its 2022 peak, nearing 2019 levels, as employers reduce hiring. Consequently, the median pay raise for job switchers has also dropped to 7% in July, down from 20% in 2022, indicating a shift in leverage back towards employers. This deceleration, also influenced by business uncertainty from tariffs, could lead to dampening effects on consumer spending growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit challenging her removal by President Trump attributes any mortgage application discrepancies to a "clerical error," asserting it does not constitute "cause" for termination under the Federal Reserve Act. The suit argues the fraud allegations are pretextual, masking Trump's efforts to influence the Fed's interest rate policy. While Cook's filing avoids specific refutations, a legal expert suggests this is a strategy to avoid legitimizing the claims. The market remains relatively unaffected, though analysts warn of potential "Trumpification" of the Fed if Cook's removal succeeds. (not investment advice)</p>
