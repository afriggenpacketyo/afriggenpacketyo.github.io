          <p>The Japanese government has approved a new disaster management plan to better protect citizens from a potential major earthquake and tsunami, particularly from the feared Nankai Trough fault. The move comes as the Tokara Islands experience an unusually intense and prolonged earthquake swarm, prompting some evacuations. While authorities state this swarm is not a precursor to the Nankai Trough quake, they acknowledge a major disaster is inevitable. The new plans aim to reduce projected fatalities by 80% through infrastructure upgrades and enhanced public education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Department of Homeland Security from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in parts of California. The ruling responds to a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests, particularly targeting Latino communities. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, stating its agents remove dangerous criminals from communities. The order applies to several counties, including Los Angeles, and a hearing on the case is scheduled to follow soon.</p>

          <p>This article details President Trump's recent trade policy actions, specifically the letters sent to foreign leaders outlining new tariff rates set to take effect on August 1. These letters follow a 90-day "pause" during which the administration sought to negotiate new trade deals to avert a return to higher tariff levels. So far, only one new deal has been signed with the United Kingdom, leaving many other countries facing significant rate hikes. The approach introduces considerable uncertainty, as rates could be lowered if countries remove their trade barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the June 12 Air India crash in Ahmedabad, which killed 261 people, has found that the plane's engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff. This action starved the engines of fuel and led to a total loss of power. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, to which the other pilot replied he had not.

          <p>Palestinian officials involved in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release negotiations in Doha state that the talks are close to collapsing. They accuse the Israeli delegation of stalling the process and lacking the authority to make decisions on key issues like troop withdrawal and aid distribution. A major point of contention is a map provided by Israel outlining a proposed "buffer zone," which Hamas officials viewed as a bad-faith maneuver. The officials believe Israel used the talks to create a positive diplomatic image during recent high-level visits.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Alliance Between US Tech Sector and 'Maga' Movement on China Policy Could Face Challenges</h2>

          <p>Chinese academic analysis suggests the emerging alignment between US tech leaders and the "Make America Great Again" movement may prove to be an "uneasy alliance." While many in the tech sector support a hardline stance on containing China's technological development, a researcher notes that internal tensions could undermine this coalition's political influence. The analysis also highlights the growing ties between the US tech and defense industries. This article suggests these "tech hawks" could escalate threats against China, even as they navigate a complex domestic political landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
