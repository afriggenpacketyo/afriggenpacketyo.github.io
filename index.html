          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after more than 35 years in prison.

The defense argued the brothers acted out of fear due to years of sexual assault, while the prosecution argued they haven't fully atoned for their crimes.

          <p>Left-wing streamer Hasan Piker alleges he was detained and questioned by federal authorities at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for over two hours after arriving on an international flight. Piker claims he was asked about his opinions on Donald Trump, Israel, Hamas, and the Houthis, which he believes violated his First Amendment rights. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the detention but disputed Piker's account, calling his claims of political targeting baseless. Legal analysts suggest that while international travelers have reduced Fourth Amendment rights at entry points, there are limits to questioning beyond identity and citizenship.</p>

The decision follows backlash from fire survivors and state senators, who requested a delay pending investigation into alleged insurance payment delays.

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking to hire lawyers to investigate employee misconduct, including unauthorized communications with the media. The job posting suggests the lawyers will defend grievances filed by employees, following emails sent to some USAID employees about being under "administrative inquiry" for engaging with the press without authorization. This effort is seen as part of an ongoing conflict between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and federal workers affected by agency downsizing.</p>

          <p>State Farm will be allowed to temporarily increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California, following state approval in the wake of catastrophic fires. The insurer, citing a "dire situation," already received a 20% rate increase last year, prompting criticism from consumer groups and homeowners struggling to receive payments after the fires. State Farm must now justify its financial condition and detail its recovery plan at a hearing later this year. The higher rate comes as survivors of the Eaton fire report payment delays and lowballed offers.</p>
