          <p>During a contentious congressional hearing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth clashed with Democratic senators over the military's role in protests. Senator Elissa Slotkin questioned Hegseth's authorization of military detentions and the potential use of lethal force against protesters, referencing claims from former Defense Secretary Mark Esper's memoir about Trump's inquiries during the 2020 George Floyd protests. Hegseth denied any orders to shoot protesters, but declined to comment on whether troops could use force against unarmed civilians. Senator Jacky Rosen also questioned Hegseth about the influence of social media on personnel decisions, highlighting concerns over the firings of national security officials based on a social media influencer's advice.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials demonstrated a 99.9% effectiveness rate among participants, marking a significant advancement in the fight against HIV. Gilead's CEO hailed the approval as a pivotal moment, potentially ending the HIV epidemic. However, experts warn that the Trump administration's recent funding cuts to HIV vaccine research could hinder long-term progress, emphasizing the continued need for vaccine development despite this breakthrough. This decision may have lasting consequences for HIV vaccine research, potentially setting back efforts by a decade. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing its strategy of assessing the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates increased inflation, it still projects two interest rate cuts by year-end, aligning with previous forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's strength, citing a robust labor market and improved sentiment, but acknowledged that new tariffs could drive inflation and slow growth. Economists predict a rate cut at the September meeting, contingent on developments related to tariff inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit highlights a trend of federal regulators prioritizing 'common sense' over data-driven evidence in policymaking. The Department of Transportation defended a regulation mandating two-person crews on freight trains based on 'common sense' rather than empirical evidence. This approach represents a dangerous precedent, allowing agencies to bypass the legal responsibility to document market failures and present cost-benefit analyses. The government's own data does not support the notion that two-person crews are safer than one-person crews, yet the regulation persists due to political influence from Big Labor.</p>

          <p>Aerial attacks between Israel and Iran have continued, marking a sixth day of strikes following Israel's initial attack. The operation targeted key facilities and resulted in the deaths of nuclear scientists and military leaders, according to Israeli officials.

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has revised guidelines for VA hospitals, removing explicit prohibitions against discrimination based on political beliefs or marital status. The new rules, influenced by Trump's executive order, raise concerns about potential denial of care based on personal characteristics not federally protected. Experts warn that these changes could disproportionately affect female and LGBTQ+ veterans, as well as those in rural areas with limited healthcare options. The move has sparked criticism from medical experts and veterans' advocates.</p>

          <p>Despite campaigning on a promise to end U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, President Trump's recent support for Israeli attacks on Iran suggests a shift away from his anti-war stance. Trump's rhetoric in the past emphasized a focus on domestic issues and avoiding foreign entanglements. However, his current administration is sending mixed signals, with some officials insisting the U.S. wonâ€™t become an active participant in the conflict unless Americans are targeted. This shift could alienate voters who supported Trump's promise of a more isolationist foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Karen Read has been acquitted of the murder of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in a second trial that concluded three years after his death. Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her car and leaving him to die in the snow, but the defense argued that he was killed by others and framed. The jury found Read guilty only of operating a vehicle under the influence. Read's supporters celebrated the verdict, with her expressing gratitude and asserting her fight for justice for O'Keefe.</p>

          <p>Posters with red lettering have appeared on lampposts and storefronts in Los Angeles with the words 'Missing son,' 'Missing father,' and 'Missing grandmother.' The posters are of immigrants who have been disappeared by ICE. The posters are a campaign of quiet resistance on the streets of Los Angeles. On Monday, a walk down Sunset Boulevard in the historic Silver Lake neighborhood meant encountering an array of flyers, artwork and spray-painted messages of support for disappeared immigrants and fury at the administration.</p>
