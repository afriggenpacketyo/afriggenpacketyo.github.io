          <p>Columbia University has reached a substantial $200 million settlement with the Trump administration, resolving claims of discrimination against Jewish students. This critical agreement ensures the reinstatement of hundreds of millions in federal grants that were previously terminated or paused. While the university does not admit wrongdoing, it acknowledges the painful incidents experienced by Jewish students and the need for comprehensive reforms. The deal also includes an additional $21 million to settle U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations and mandates federal monitoring of admissions and hiring practices, concluding a months-long dispute over federal funding and campus antisemitism.</p>

          <p>An Afghan interpreter, Amir, who saved a U.S. Army officer's life multiple times, fears deportation despite having a green card, as the Trump administration targets Afghan refugees. Retired officer Dewey Yopp, whom Amir rescued, helped him secure a Special Immigrant Visa, highlighting the government's broken promises to allies. Thousands of Afghans in the U.S. face uncertainty as the administration seeks to end their legal status and has threatened green card holders. Veterans view this as a moral injury, while the State Department's "Do Not Travel" advisory for Afghanistan contradicts claims of safety for returnees.</p>

          <p>South Korea's SK Hynix achieved record operating profit and revenue in the second quarter, significantly exceeding analyst forecasts. This robust financial performance is primarily driven by strong, sustained demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is essential for generative AI chipsets. As a key supplier to Nvidia, the company anticipates doubling its HBM sales in 2025 and projects continued healthy demand within the server market, even amidst global macroeconomic uncertainties. SK Hynix plans to increase capital expenditure in 2025 to ensure support for its HBM customers, reinforcing its dominant position in the competitive AI memory sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a comprehensive 28-page AI Action Plan, aiming to accelerate U.S. innovation in artificial intelligence while reducing "bureaucratic red tape" and perceived "ideological bias." The plan outlines over 90 policy actions for the coming year, emphasizing building data center infrastructure and promoting American technology. Critics, however, view it as prioritizing corporate interests over public needs and potentially dismantling safeguards. The plan also calls for federal agencies to review and repeal policies hindering AI development, with President Trump signing related executive orders to promote AI exports and address "woke" AI systems.</p>

          <p>A new study by Common Sense Media reveals that over 70% of teenagers use AI companions, with half doing so regularly, often seeking personal advice and emotional support. While AI is always available and non-judgmental, researchers are concerned that this reliance could hinder the development of crucial social skills and exacerbate loneliness among youth. Experts emphasize that AI companions should complement, not replace, real-world interactions. The largely unregulated AI industry is becoming deeply integrated into adolescent lives, raising warnings for parents and policymakers about potential long-term impacts on mental health and social development.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan migrants recently deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's CECOT prison have provided harrowing accounts of systematic beatings, deprivation, and psychological torment. Inmates described being subjected to six consecutive days of beatings, often naked, with guards recording videos. Released as part of a U.S.-Venezuela prisoner swap, these individuals reported being cut off from family and legal aid, and confined to dark punishment cells. Their testimonies contradict the Salvadoran government's portrayal of the facility, exposing severe human rights abuses within a system President Bukele designed for inmates to leave "inside a coffin."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, has definitively ruled President Trump's executive order attempting to curtail birthright citizenship as unconstitutional. The panel of judges asserted that the order directly contradicts the "plain language" of the Fourteenth Amendment, which unequivocally grants citizenship to "all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." This significant decision marks the first instance an appellate court has addressed the merits of Trump's controversial policy, which sought to end birthright citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants.

New funding from Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" aims to expand enforcement, including hiring 10,000 new agents.

While overall opioid overdoses have decreased, the re-emergence of illegally manufactured carfentanil, which can evade some test strips, threatens this progress.

Despite this, the median U.S. home sale price reached a record $396,000 in June, partly due to homeowners with low interest rates being reluctant to sell.

          <p>Freddie Freeman's two-run, two-out single in the ninth inning secured a 4-3 walk-off win for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Minnesota Twins. This victory came despite ongoing struggles from the Dodgers' bullpen, which has seen its ERA balloon recently. The bullpen's heavy workload is partly attributed to starting pitchers averaging less than five innings per start. While the rotation is getting healthier with Tyler Glasnow's strong return and Blake Snell's impending return, the team's relievers have pitched a major-league-leading number of innings, signaling a significant area for improvement.</p>

          <p>Following an executive order by President Trump to purge "unpatriotic" signage from national parks, Muir Woods National Monument has removed its "History Under Construction" exhibit. This exhibit, created by park rangers, had expanded the monument's historical timeline to include the contributions of Indigenous people and women, as well as complex legacies of figures like John Muir. Critics, including former park rangers, decry the move as censorship of American history and an attempt to promote a "rose-colored view" that disparages a full understanding of the past. The order aims to restore federal sites to a narrative of "greatness" and "beauty."</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in Department of Justice documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the Epstein files, citing unverified hearsay and sensitive victim information. While being named doesn't imply wrongdoing, the report has fueled backlash from Trump's supporters who allege a "deep state" cover-up. Trump has since directed the DOJ to seek unsealing of grand jury transcripts, denying he was told his name was in the files and dismissing the WSJ report as "fake news."</p>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders to position the U.S. as an "AI export powerhouse," including a directive targeting what the White House calls "woke" artificial intelligence models. This initiative is part of a broader anti-diversity campaign, with Trump stating Americans do not want "woke Marxist lunacy" in AI. The orders also aim to expedite federal permitting for data center infrastructure and promote American AI exports. Critics warn that the definition of "politically biased" AI is contentious, potentially allowing the administration to target companies discretionarily. This move aligns with conservative grievances against perceived liberal biases in tech.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Florida has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the 2000s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, citing federal rules on grand jury secrecy. The judge ruled that the Justice Department's argument of "extensive public interest" did not meet the "special circumstances" required for unsealing. This decision does not affect pending requests in New York related to later federal investigations. The ruling comes amidst intense public scrutiny and political pressure for transparency regarding Epstein's cases, particularly after the DOJ stated there was no "incriminating client list" and affirmed his suicide.</p>

While acknowledging Powell's past missteps, the article asserts that current high interest rates reflect market fears over surging national debt, not just monetary policy.
