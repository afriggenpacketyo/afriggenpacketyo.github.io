          <p>Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was shot and seriously injured during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. The 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA was reportedly shot in the neck by a rifle from a distance, prompting a campus lockdown and a search for the suspect, who remains at large. Kirk was transported to a local hospital for surgery, with his condition currently unknown. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation from political figures across the spectrum, including President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who have called for prayers and a rejection of political violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an Israeli airstrike that killed several Hamas-affiliated individuals in Doha, the potential for a wider conflict is being carefully assessed by regional experts. While Qatar condemned the attack, analysts believe a direct military retaliation is unlikely due to Qatar's strategic alliance with the United States, which has its largest regional military base there. Instead, Qatar may exert economic pressure, but its role as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas is now under significant strain. The incident highlights the shifting alliances in the Middle East, with President Trump expressing he was "not thrilled" about the strike on a key U.S. ally.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is facing scrutiny over Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, due to newly revealed details about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Documents released by US lawmakers included a letter where Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal." Despite calls for his dismissal from Conservatives and some Labour MPs, Starmer has stood by Mandelson, stating he has repeatedly expressed "deep regret" for the friendship. Lord Mandelson admitted he continued his association with Epstein for too long, claiming he "fell for his lies" and relied on false assurances of his innocence.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, targeted and killed six people, including the son of a senior Hamas negotiator, an act Qatar has labeled "state terrorism." The attack has stunned the Gulf nation, a key U.S. ally and mediator in the Gaza conflict, and has effectively derailed the latest ceasefire negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the operation, stating that terrorist leaders no longer have immunity anywhere. The unilateral strike, conducted without advance warning to Qatar, now casts serious doubt on the future of mediated talks to end the nearly two-year-long war and secure the release of remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Oracle experienced a historic stock surge, closing nearly 36% higher and adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. This marks the company's best single-day performance since 1992, driven by a staggering report of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. The massive backlog is attributed to immense demand for its cloud infrastructure, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Despite missing quarterly revenue and earnings estimates, the overwhelming cloud demand and future revenue projections have cemented investor confidence in Oracle's position as a key player in the AI sector.

Mamdani points out that ticket prices are expected to be significantly higher than in previous World Cups.

Another key tactic is to diligently shop around with multiple lenders, as this can often yield rates up to a full percentage point lower than the national average.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates this month, savers should consider how this will affect returns on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. This article explains that CDs, with their fixed interest rates, are better positioned to lock in current high returns before rates fall further. Once a CD is opened, its rate is guaranteed for the entire term. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely decrease following a Fed cut. The choice depends on the saver's goals: CDs offer predictable returns at the cost of liquidity, while savings accounts provide flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council reveals that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report underscores the deep economic interdependence between the two nations, with bilateral trade having grown nearly fivefold in two decades. While exports to China, primarily soybeans, iron ore, and oil, generate higher-paying jobs, they are concentrated among fewer than 3,000 companies. This concentration raises concerns about Brazil's economic exposure and reliance on a small number of commodities and a single major trading partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The overall death rate in the United States declined by 3.8% in 2024, reaching its lowest level since 2020, according to a new CDC report. For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the ten leading causes of death in the country. The report, based on provisional data, shows heart disease and cancer remain the top two causes of death, with both seeing a slight increase in total deaths from the previous year. Unintentional injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease were also among the leading causes. The data signals a significant shift in the nation's public health landscape post-pandemic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is appealing a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had granted an injunction, stating that Cook's removal would violate the Federal Reserve Act, which requires removal to be for legal "cause," and that maintaining the Fed's independence was in the public interest. Trump announced his intention to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her lawyers argue the firing is a pretext in a broader campaign to pressure the central bank on interest rate policy.</p>

They allege they were fired as part of a "campaign of retribution" against officials perceived as disloyal to President Trump. The lawsuit claims Patel admitted the firings were "likely illegal" but was pressured by the White House to remove anyone involved in previous investigations of the president. The plaintiffs argue their dismissals were politically motivated, degraded national security, and are seeking reinstatement and back pay for what they contend was an unlawful purge.</p>

As a result, he will now have clear control over both Fox Corp. and News Corp. through 2050. Speaking at a conference, he stated the resolution provides clarity and strategic consistency for investors, ensuring that the conservative-leaning direction of assets like Fox News will continue unchanged under his long-term leadership.</p>

Despite ongoing airstrikes, up to a million people remain in the city, with many saying they are unable or unwilling to leave. Israel is directing residents to humanitarian zones in the south and building new aid distribution sites, but aid organizations warn these areas are already overcrowded and unsafe.

          <p>A recent incursion of numerous Russian drones deep into Polish airspace is being widely interpreted by European officials as a deliberate provocation and a test of NATO's defenses. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described the situation as the closest the nation has been to open conflict since World War II and requested consultations under NATO's Article 4. While Russia denies intent, defense analysts believe the scale of the incursion was intentional, designed to gauge Western response times and political will. The incident puts pressure on the U.S. and its allies to demonstrate a firm, unified response to avoid showing weakness to Moscow.</p>

For three consecutive weeks, Chinese imports are down 27% year-over-year, and logistics experts do not foresee the usual late-September rush before China's Golden Week holiday. This slowdown is attributed to the ongoing trade war, which prompted an early front-loading of inventory, and subsequent reports of high inventory levels in the U.S. causing retailers to pause shipping. Key product segments seeing reductions include furniture, toys, and electronics. (not investment advice)</p>
