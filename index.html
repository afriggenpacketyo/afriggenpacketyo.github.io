          <p>A building explosion in Madrid on Saturday resulted in the death of one person and injuries to 25 others. Emergency services, using search dogs, discovered the body of a man during a rescue operation following the blast.

This regional strategy allows China to tap into vast resources crucial for high-tech industries while also sidelining other international competitors, including those from Europe.

          <p>Senior officials from the United States and China are meeting in Madrid to discuss pressing issues including trade tariffs, national security, and the future of TikTok. The talks are part of an ongoing effort to stabilize the strained relationship, particularly concerning U.S. tariffs and China's role in global technology. Ahead of the meeting, China launched anti-dumping and anti-discrimination investigations into the U.S. semiconductor sector, signaling continued friction. A potential extension of the deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations is a possible outcome.</p>

          <p>A draft economic framework between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda outlines a plan to reform their mineral supply chains with support from the U.S. and other international partners. The agreement, part of a broader peace deal, seeks to attract Western investment by de-risking the sector, increasing transparency, and reducing illicit trade in resources like gold, cobalt, and lithium. However, implementation faces obstacles, as progress on security issues, including the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from eastern Congo, has stalled, complicating economic cooperation.

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who took her own life in April, has stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother cited the appointment as evidence of deep-seated corruption within political systems. The criticism follows Mandelson's recent dismissal by the Prime Minister after emails revealed the extent of his relationship with Epstein.

          <p>The Chinese military has conducted another "routine patrol" in the South China Sea, its second in under two weeks, while issuing a stern warning to the Philippines. A spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army urged Manila to cease provocations and stop involving external forces, asserting that such efforts are doomed to fail. The patrol follows Beijing's recent announcement of plans to establish a national nature reserve at the contested Scarborough Shoal. The action underscores escalating tensions as China continues to assert its sovereignty claims in the disputed waters.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that women trying to conceive should avoid cannabis, as its active ingredient, THC, may negatively affect fertility. Researchers found that THC can disrupt the development and genetic stability of human egg cells, leading to a lower probability of creating genetically healthy embryos. The study, conducted on women undergoing IVF, showed that patients with detectable THC had significantly fewer embryos with a normal set of chromosomes. These findings indicate that cannabis use could reduce the chances of a successful pregnancy and a healthy child.</p>

Historians and activists see parallels between this Nazi-era legal framework and the rhetoric of far-right groups like the AfD, which distinguishes between 'real Germans' and 'passport Germans.'

Although Turkey's NATO membership offers some protection, the strike on Qatar, a close U.S. ally, has heightened anxieties in Ankara.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Foreign Policy Weakness Emboldens Russia and Israel</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's self-styled 'strongman' image is a facade that conceals significant weakness in foreign policy, which has emboldened adversaries like Russia and Israel. The author contends that leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu exploit Trump's vanity and lack of resolve, leading to escalations like Russian drone incursions into Poland and the Israeli airstrike in Qatar. The piece suggests that Trump's actions have undermined Western cohesion and prolonged global conflicts. It calls on European and other democratic nations to take a stronger, more independent stance to prevent a descent into global anarchy.</p>

          <h2>Royal Pageantry to Play Key Diplomatic Role in Trump's UK State Visit</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK this week will feature a significant royal component, which the British government hopes to use as a diplomatic tool. King Charles III will host Trump with full pageantry, including guards of honour and a lavish state banquet at Windsor Castle, in an effort to flatter the president and facilitate discussions on sensitive topics like Ukraine and trade. Analysts suggest Trump's known admiration for the monarchy gives the King a unique advantage in influencing the often-unpredictable U.S. leader. The visit is tightly scheduled and will largely occur behind closed doors due to security concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of hen and stag parties has evolved from a simple night out into elaborate, multi-day destination events that are placing a significant financial burden on attendees. Many young adults report spending over £1,000 on a single event, with costs for flights, accommodation, matching outfits, and activities quickly accumulating. Social pressure often compels people to attend despite the expense, leading to stress and resentment. As a result, many are now re-evaluating these costly celebrations, with some engaged couples consciously planning more affordable events to avoid straining their friends' finances.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the mysterious 2005 disappearance of George Smith from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship during his honeymoon. Smith vanished after a night of heavy drinking in the ship's casino, and a large bloodstain was found on a lifeboat canopy below his cabin's balcony. The investigation focused on a group of young men last seen with Smith, but no charges were ever filed. In 2015, the FBI officially closed the case, citing insufficient evidence to prove foul play, leaving Smith's family devastated and without answers about whether his death was an accident or a murder.</p>

          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs are preparing for a Super Bowl rematch against the Philadelphia Eagles, but their prospects for revenge appear slim due to significant roster challenges. The Chiefs' offense is heavily reliant on quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with key receiver Rashee Rice suspended and Xavier Worthy injured, leaving a depleted supporting cast. In contrast, the Eagles appear to have strengthened their roster with players like Saquon Barkley and a deep receiving corps. The Chiefs' struggling run game and early-season defeat have raised concerns about their ability to compete at the highest level this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a prevailing bullish sentiment on Wall Street and the S&P 500 reaching record highs, analysts are highlighting several risks that could derail the current market rally. Key concerns include potential weaknesses in the dominant artificial intelligence investment theme, negative impacts from the ongoing trade war, and the pressures of swelling government debt. A potential weakening of the U.S. labor market is also cited as a significant threat. While many strategists have recently raised their price targets for the index, they acknowledge that these underlying risks could lead to a hard landing for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame an early three-run deficit to defeat the San Francisco Giants 13-7, powered by a crucial six-run rally in the fifth inning. After starter Clayton Kershaw struggled in the first, the Dodgers' offense, which has been inconsistent, finally capitalized on scoring opportunities. The turning point came with the bases loaded in the fifth, as Teoscar Hernández hit a two-run double to give the Dodgers the lead, opening the floodgates for more runs. The win helps the team maintain its 2.5-game lead in the National League West standings.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has inaugurated its controversial $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile River, sparking a fierce diplomatic protest from Egypt. Cairo has labeled the move an "unlawful unilateral act," warning it will take all necessary measures to protect its water supply, which it believes is threatened by the dam. The project, which is backed by Chinese financing, has also raised safety concerns in Sudan, another downstream nation. As the dispute escalates, observers note that China, with its strong ties to all involved parties, is uniquely positioned to mediate, though it has so far remained neutral.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced an initial investment of AU$12 billion ($8 billion) to upgrade the Henderson shipyard near Perth, a key part of its plan to support a future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.
