          <p>China stated that there are no ongoing trade talks with the U.S., contradicting White House indications of easing tensions. A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson emphasized that all claims of progress in bilateral talks should be disregarded, demanding the U.S. to cancel all unilateral tariffs on China. This stance echoes the Foreign Ministry, asserting China's willingness to engage in discussions only if treated as an equal. The U.S. had recently imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing, including restrictions on critical mineral exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>March home sales experienced a significant drop, reaching their slowest pace since 2009, largely due to higher mortgage rates and broader economic concerns.

Despite a rise in available listings, the market remains lean, and prices are starting to feel the pressure, although the median price remains at an all-time high for March.

          <p>President Zelensky of Ukraine firmly rejects recognizing Russian control over Crimea, a key point of contention in President Trump's proposed peace plan. Trump suggests that Crimea was "lost years ago" and should not be part of peace negotiations. However, Zelensky insists that renouncing Crimea would be unconscionable, citing the Ukrainian constitution, which mandates that the country's sovereignty extends throughout its entire territory. The issue of Crimea remains a significant stumbling block in achieving a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

Jason was a widower with two children when he hired Molly as an au pair, and their relationship turned romantic before they married and moved to the U.S. The case involved claims of domestic abuse, custody battles, and a controversial trial, ultimately resulting in convictions that were later overturned.</p>
