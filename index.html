        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit accusing online real estate giants Zillow and Redfin of striking an unlawful agreement to suppress competition in the multifamily rental advertising market. The FTC alleges Zillow paid Redfin $100 million for Redfin to exit the competitive space, transfer its customers, and merely syndicate Zillow's listings, thereby making Redfin's offerings redundant. This move is deemed a violation of federal antitrust laws, harming renters and property managers by consolidating an already concentrated market crucial for housing. Both Zillow and Redfin strongly disagree with the government's claims, arguing their partnership is pro-competitive and expands access to listings for consumers.</p>

          <p>The federal government faces a potential shutdown at midnight unless Congress resolves its funding disputes, marking the 21st such event since 1977. President Trump and congressional leaders failed to reach an agreement, with Democrats demanding overhauls to Medicaid cuts and health care tax credit extensions that Republicans oppose. A shutdown could furlough millions of federal employees, including essential workers like airport security and military personnel, who would work without pay. Impacts range from national park closures and slowed Social Security payments to stalled FDA food safety reviews and postponed civil litigation. The economic activity lost during the last 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019 was estimated at $3 billion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a $500 million settlement with Harvard University to resolve a dispute over alleged civil rights violations concerning Jewish and Israeli students. This deal follows months of accusations from Trump, who previously cut federal funding and attempted to ban international student enrollment at Harvard. A federal judge recently ruled against the administration's unlawful termination of $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard. The settlement, which Harvard has not yet confirmed, also reportedly includes the university operating trade schools focused on AI and other vocational training. This outcome is significantly larger than previous settlements with other universities facing similar federal probes.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed former player Micah Parsons' public comments regarding Jones' failure to contact him after Parsons' trade to the Green Bay Packers. Jones clarified that he ceased making calls to Parsons because the player had explicitly asked him to remove his number from his phone. This exchange occurred after a high-scoring 40-40 tie between the Cowboys and Packers, where Parsons, playing for his new team, recorded a sack against his former quarterback. Jones indicated he felt good about the trade, suggesting the game affirmed the decision. The ultimate impact of the blockbuster trade, involving two first-round picks and Kenny Clark for Parsons, will unfold over time.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 18:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the immense potential for valuable metals and rare earths found on the ocean floor, deep-sea mining remains largely inaccessible due to unresolved legal frameworks rather than technological limitations. The commercial exploitation of these seabed minerals is contingent on the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN agency, establishing a comprehensive mining code. This code would encompass legal, environmental, and operational regulations. However, the finalization of these guidelines has been significantly delayed within the ISA, primarily because of growing global environmental concerns.

          <p>A satirical article presents a hypothetical email exchange between Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump addressing the entire U.S. military leadership about a "Warfighter Ethos." The email, written in an exaggerated and aggressive tone, criticizes "fat troops," reinstates transphobia, dismisses diversity, and advocates for a "loose, improvisational feel to war." Trump's response is depicted as rambling, focusing on renaming the "Gulf of Mexico" to "Gulf of America," praising his signature, and discussing tariffs. The piece critiques perceived anti-DEI sentiments and the politicization of the military under the Trump administration, highlighting a departure from traditional military values and decorum.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier publicly criticized WNBA leadership, including Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, for a perceived lack of accountability regarding inconsistent officiating and player welfare. Speaking at her team's end-of-season press conference, Collier, a WNBA Players Assn. executive council member, described the league's approach as "tone deaf" and "dismissive." Her remarks followed an ankle injury during a game where no foul was called, and her coach's subsequent suspension and record fine for protesting officiating. Collier also highlighted concerns about player salaries and the league's use of "sustainability" as a buzzword to avoid addressing core issues, garnering widespread support from other players.</p>

This approach creates massive domestic demand for advanced AI capabilities, fostering a built-in market for China's own AI chips.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing accusations of violating federal ethics laws by deploying taxpayer-funded resources to assign blame to Democrats for a potential government shutdown. Internal federal agency emails and public websites, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development's, displayed overtly partisan messages, asserting that Democrats were forcing the shutdown due to their "wish list of demands." Ethics experts warn that this conduct could constitute a violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in most political activity while on duty. Critics argue such actions politicize federal agencies and undermine impartiality, representing a significant departure from past administrations' non-partisan communication during similar funding lapses.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for residential construction workers to over $32 an hour, plus an additional $7.65 per hour for healthcare. This initiative aims to attract workers to the struggling home construction industry, particularly as the city needs to rebuild units lost in the Palisades fire. Proponents argue that higher wages and benefits are crucial to protect non-union, often foreign-born, workers vulnerable to wage theft and exploitation, and to combat worker shortages partly fueled by fears of immigration raids. A study on the economic effects of this wage increase is currently being commissioned.</p>

The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) views these reforms as a direct "assault" on the public postal service and unionized jobs, while Canada Post warns the industrial action will further deteriorate its financial state.

          <p>The Wall Street Journal's 2026 rankings identify the top 10 best value colleges in the U.S., with seven institutions from the City University of New York (CUNY) network making the list. Baruch College in Manhattan secured the top spot for the third consecutive year, recognized for its affordability and significant impact on graduates' salaries. The rankings considered average net price after financial aid and the value added to graduate earnings, calculated against high school-only earners in the state. While prestigious schools like Princeton and Stanford also offer great value, CUNY colleges provide strong outcomes at a substantially lower cost, appealing to families prioritizing affordability over traditional prestige.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is making "massive progress" in its restructuring efforts, securing up to $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing from debtholders, along with $150 million from a major aircraft lessor. The struggling budget airline filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within a year due to high costs and weak demand. As part of its cost-cutting strategy, Spirit plans to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft and 12 airport leases, while also negotiating cuts with its pilots' union. This financial lifeline aims to ensure the airline's continued operation and build a stronger future, despite some competitors predicting its demise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A photograph captured a private text message to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, allegedly from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, expressing alarm over a $20 billion U.S. bailout to Argentina. The message criticized the deal, claiming Argentina subsequently removed export tariffs on grains, sold soybeans to China at a disadvantageous time for the U.S., and further depressed soybean prices. This, the text suggested, increased China's leverage over the U.S. The incident highlights internal administration discord over trade policy, particularly as U.S. soybean farmers struggle with reduced sales to China due to ongoing tariff wars. The American Soybean Association has urged the Trump administration to secure a deal with China.</p>

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown is anticipated to have a relatively minor impact on most mortgage applicants, as private lenders are expected to maintain their operations as usual. Nevertheless, borrowers applying for government-backed loans from agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), or Department of Agriculture (USDA) might experience slight delays due to federal worker furloughs. While FHA and VA loans are largely projected to proceed, the USDA would halt the issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans. Furthermore, obtaining flood insurance through the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program could become complicated, potentially delaying closings for properties located in flood zones.</p>

The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), which has operated the helpline since 2022, is fighting the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey (CCGNJ), the number's original owner, which wants it back. The NCPG argues that reverting control would jeopardize access for thousands, citing its significant financial backing and increased call traffic. The CCGNJ, however, accuses NCPG of "weaponizing the number" by demanding data from local councils.
