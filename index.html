          <p>Israel is marking the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas-led attacks, with memorials planned throughout the country. Meanwhile, Israeli and Hamas officials are in Cairo for negotiations on a US-proposed ceasefire agreement, which includes the return of remaining hostages and the establishment of an interim government for Gaza. The anniversary is also being observed internationally, with German officials acknowledging a rise in antisemitism in Germany since the conflict began. The war has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian casualties in Gaza, leading to accusations of genocide from international groups.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has deployed the state's National Guard units to assist in protecting federal property in cities like Chicago and Portland, following a request from President Donald Trump. The move is part of a White House plan to bolster security amid protests targeting federal facilities. The deployment has faced opposition from Democratic governors, such as Illinois' J.B. Pritzker, who described it as an "invasion." Governor Abbott defended the action, stating he fully authorized the deployment to ensure the safety of federal officials and enforce the law.</p>

          <p>As Israeli and Hamas negotiators engage in indirect talks in Egypt, several major sticking points remain in the U.S.-proposed peace plan. Key areas of contention include the structure and timing of hostage releases, with trust between the two sides being virtually nonexistent. Further disagreements persist over Hamas's disarmament, the future governance of Gaza, and the timeline for a complete Israeli military withdrawal from the territory. The political future of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also complicates the negotiations, as his far-right coalition partners oppose concessions.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing another period of political instability following the resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu after just 27 days in office, making him President Emmanuel Macron's sixth prime minister in under two years. This crisis differs from previous ones as it was triggered not by the opposition, but by the withdrawal of support from a key ally, the center-right Les Republicains party. The collapse underscores the deep political fragmentation since the 2024 snap election, which left Macron without a stable majority. Macron has given Lecornu 48 hours to attempt further negotiations, but options remain limited.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its 2025 GDP growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a previous prediction of 4%, citing the positive effects of government support measures. This revision brings the forecast closer to Beijing's official target of around 5%. Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China's exports have remained resilient, offsetting domestic weaknesses like the property slump and sluggish consumer spending.

          <p>The Treasury Department has appointed Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano to the newly created position of CEO of the IRS. In this dual role, Bisignano will oversee the day-to-day operations of the IRS while continuing to lead the Social Security Administration. The move has drawn criticism and concern from policy experts and advocacy groups, who point to potential conflicts of interest regarding taxpayer data and the immense challenge of leading two major federal agencies simultaneously. This appointment is the latest in a series of leadership changes at the IRS during the Trump administration.</p>

Republican and Green Party candidates have condemned the measure as corrupt and unconstitutional, arguing it undermines the independent commission voters established in 2020.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has announced a dramatic 880% increase in its UK sales for September compared to the previous year, making the UK its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,000 cars, largely driven by its Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV, and now holds a 3.6% share of the UK market. This growth occurs as the UK has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and the US, making it an attractive market for brands like BYD. The surge aligns with record-high EV sales in the UK, although petrol and diesel vehicles still constitute the majority of new car purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

U.S. Border Patrol recorded approximately 238,000 apprehensions, a dramatic decrease from the record highs seen under the previous administration. The Trump administration attributes the sharp decline to its stringent immigration policies, including ending the "catch-and-release" practice, militarizing the border, and conducting large-scale interior enforcement operations. While the policies have deterred illegal crossings, they have also faced significant legal challenges and condemnation from civil rights groups.</p>

          <p>Tamara Wallace, the mayor of South Lake Tahoe, has publicly confessed to stealing funds from a local Presbyterian church over an extended period. In a letter published by a local newspaper, Wallace revealed that overwhelming guilt from the undiscovered theft led her to a mental health crisis and a suicide attempt. She has since received treatment and is now coming forward to apologize and pledge restitution, attributing her actions to a lifetime of trauma. It is currently unclear if criminal charges will be filed against Wallace, whose mayoral term is set to end next month.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is causing significant disruptions to air travel, with Hollywood Burbank Airport in Los Angeles experiencing a nearly six-hour period with no air traffic controllers on duty in its tower. This staffing shortage is part of a nationwide issue affecting numerous airports as essential federal employees, including 13,000 air traffic controllers, are required to work without pay. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned of delays and potential reductions in air traffic flow to maintain safety. The situation highlights the tangible consequences of the political impasse on critical national infrastructure.</p>

While the project promises to improve accessibility for tourists, it has also sparked debate and concern among locals and observers about its potential environmental impact. The construction involves daily crane operations lowering workers and materials down the vertical cliff face, visibly altering the natural landscape.</p>

An EU spokesperson clarified that the 1971 resolution, which transferred China's UN seat from Taipei to Beijing, was solely about representation and does not contain any mention of Taiwan's status. This statement aligns with the U.S. position and counters Beijing's assertion that the resolution provides a legal basis for its territorial claims over the island.

          <p>The city of Atlanta has passed new legislation requiring all new and replacement roofs to be "cool roofs," which are more reflective to combat the effects of urban heat. This initiative is projected to cool the city by an average of 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit and save residents an estimated $315 million in energy costs over 35 years. The policy is designed to mitigate the "heat island" effect, where dense concentrations of concrete make urban areas significantly hotter. City officials have framed the ordinance as a measure for climate justice, aimed at protecting public health and reducing energy burdens.</p>

The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, extends existing federal regulations for broadcast and cable television to the streaming industry. The bill was inspired by the common annoyance of sudden volume spikes during ad breaks. Because many major streaming platforms are based in California, this state law is expected to set a de facto national standard for commercial audio levels.</p>

The end of the preferential trade agreement is seen as a strategic setback for U.S. influence on the continent.
