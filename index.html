          <p>Russian aerial attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least 13 deaths and 56 injuries, according to regional officials. The assault included 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles targeting Kyiv, causing fires in residential areas and damaging homes and businesses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks, stating that they reinforce the world's belief that Moscow is prolonging the war. This barrage occurred amidst prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine, agreed upon after talks in Turkey, with both sides exchanging hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the largest exchange since February 2022.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, resulting in the death of 19 crew members. The images were obtained using advanced deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The USS F-1 collided with another submarine during exercises and was lost for nearly 60 years before being rediscovered in 1972. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed nearby in 1950, and a remembrance ceremony was held for the lost crew members.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, identified as O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution and informing U.S. authorities about the violence he had experienced. The judge criticized the government for errors in the case and said O.C.G., who is gay and living in hiding in Guatemala, was likely to show that his removal lacked due process. The ruling adds to the legal battles over the Trump administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine engaged in large-scale dueling air assaults, launching hundreds of drones in hourslong raids. The attacks came as both sides were carrying out the war’s largest prisoner exchange, a stark reminder that despite ongoing efforts to de-escalate the conflict, a resolution remains far off. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement Saturday morning. “With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,” he added, noting that Russia had repeatedly ignored Ukraine’s offers to enforce a temporary cease-fire.</p>

The project has drawn concerns in local media, but garnered a laudatory write-up in the Bari Weiss-founded Free Press. Since McNiel took control of the property, it has played host to a string of events, many of them featuring figures associated with overlapping rightwing movements. The current version of a document explaining the DAO aligns the project with the network state movement, claiming that “the grand project of liberalism is crumbling, and that in its wake people are looking for new avenues of allegiance and interdependence”.</p>
