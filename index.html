          <p>Hours before his assassination, conservative activist Charlie Kirk posted on social media about a Wall Street Journal article concerning a Kentucky child custody law that presumes equal parenting time is in a child's best interest. The article he shared noted the law's correlation with a falling divorce rate and its growing adoption in other states. Kirk's post highlighted polling data showing that shared parenting policies have overwhelming bipartisan support among voters, suggesting that political candidates who champion such laws could gain a significant electoral advantage in key swing states.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, citing a need to curb alleged "abuse" of the program. The move, set to take effect imminently, has drawn sharp criticism from immigration lawyers and small businesses who argue it will price them out of attracting global talent and harm American competitiveness. While large tech companies, the primary beneficiaries of the program, have reportedly accepted the change, the steep cost is expected to have a devastating impact on startups and smaller firms.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of aviation technology, has caused significant disruptions at several European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack affected the 'Muse' software used for electronic check-in and baggage systems, forcing airlines to revert to manual processing and leading to long queues, flight delays, and cancellations. Airport authorities have deployed additional staff to manage the situation, while the company works to resolve the issue, which highlights the vulnerability of interconnected global travel systems to digital threats.</p>

          <p>Ed Langevin, a retired grandfather, experienced severe heartburn, nausea, and a 20-pound weight loss, which was eventually diagnosed as chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition caused by blocked arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine. His condition was successfully treated with a minimally invasive stent procedure performed by Dr. Gabriel Wallace at Northwestern Medicine. After a follow-up procedure to address some scarring, Langevin has made a full recovery, regaining his weight and quality of life, and now advocates for patients to persist in seeking answers for their health problems.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position under pressure from the Trump administration. His departure follows a months-long mortgage fraud investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political adversary of the president, which has not resulted in charges. The move to oust Siebert has intensified concerns about the political weaponization of the Justice Department and the erosion of its independence from White House influence, particularly in matters involving figures perceived as the president's enemies.</p>

          <p>According to new data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the average math and reading scores for American 12th graders in 2024 have fallen to their lowest levels in over two decades. The report indicates a significant decline among the lowest-performing students, a trend that began before the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts suggest that factors such as chronic absenteeism, increased smartphone use, and declining student engagement are contributing to the sobering results, sparking a debate over the need for federal versus state-level educational reforms.</p>

          <p>Sweeping budget cuts and layoffs across federal agencies under the Trump administration are disproportionately impacting Black women, who represent over 12% of the federal workforce. The article highlights the loss of these public-sector jobs, which have historically provided a stable path to the middle class with reliable benefits and more equitable pay than the private sector. The layoffs have created a climate of fear and instability, causing significant economic and psychological distress and forcing many to reconsider their career paths and relationship with their work identity.</p>

          <p>A select group of seven high-valued private technology companies, including OpenAI, SpaceX, and Anthropic, have seen their combined valuation nearly double in the past year to $1.3 trillion, according to Forge Global. This surge is overwhelmingly driven by the artificial intelligence boom, which has funneled vast amounts of capital into the private market and reshaped investor priorities. With such significant private funding available, these leading AI firms have little incentive to go public, allowing them to scale rapidly while remaining outside the traditional stock market.</p>

The new laws will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers, allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes.

The reported pause occurred just before a phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where they discussed making progress on trade issues.

          <p>To help car shoppers manage costs and avoid debt, financial planners recommend the "20-4-10" rule as a helpful guideline. This framework suggests making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car for no more than four years, and ensuring that total monthly vehicle expenses—including payment, insurance, and fuel—do not exceed 10% of your monthly income. Following this rule can help prevent becoming "upside down" on a car loan, where you owe more than the vehicle is worth, and keeps transportation costs from overwhelming your budget.</p>

          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest officially began in Munich as Mayor Dieter Reiter tapped the first keg of beer, uttering the traditional phrase "O'zapft is!" ("It is tapped"). The world's largest beer and folk festival is expected to draw at least 6 million visitors over its run, which starts in September and continues until early October. Revelers will enjoy beer, traditional Bavarian food, and amusement rides, though they will face record-high prices for a one-liter mug of beer this year at the massive tourist event.</p>

          <p>Immigrant advocacy organizations are on high alert after the Trump administration issued threats to criminally prosecute non-profit groups it considers to be part of the "leftwing." In the wake of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's killing, senior White House aide Stephen Miller vowed to use government resources to hold these groups "criminally liable" for what he baselessly described as attacks on ICE agents. Activists see this as a dangerous escalation aimed at curtailing free speech and intimidating organizations that provide legal aid and support to immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Critics are warning that the Trump administration is exploiting the tragic killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to launch a campaign of vengeance against its political opponents. The administration has escalated threats against the "radical left," considered designating certain groups as domestic terrorists, and attacked the Democratic party, despite no evidence linking them to the crime. Observers draw parallels to authoritarian tactics, where a violent event is used as a pretext to crack down on dissent, undermine civil liberties, and consolidate power.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has faced a challenging week, drawing criticism from both Democrats and some conservatives for his public handling of the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation. Patel, a Trump appointee known for his MAGA alignment and criticism of the FBI, made some early missteps in the investigation but has since engaged in a campaign to claim credit for the suspect's capture. Despite the scrutiny, he reportedly retains the firm backing of President Trump, who values his combative style and loyalty.</p>

Despite the autopsy, the cause of death remained unchanged, but the family and their legal team are appealing, presenting expert opinions that suggest she was injured in a struggle and her death was staged.</p>

          <p>A proposal by the Port of Los Angeles to raise the 60-year-old Vincent Thomas Bridge is causing a rift between economic interests and local communities. The port wants to add $1.5 billion and more than a year to an existing renovation project to increase the bridge's clearance by 26 feet, allowing larger, next-generation cargo ships to pass. While port officials argue this is vital for future competitiveness and job creation, residents and local businesses in San Pedro and Wilmington are concerned about the extended closure and the impact of rerouted truck traffic.</p>

          <p>An analysis of emergency dispatch data reveals that calls for service to the Los Angeles Police Department dropped by 28% in the two weeks following the start of major U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids this summer. The decline was particularly sharp for reports of domestic violence, reinforcing long-standing concerns from advocates that aggressive immigration enforcement deters immigrant communities from reporting crimes. The data suggests a crisis of public confidence, as victims and witnesses may fear that contacting local police could lead to deportation for themselves or others.</p>

Drawing a historical parallel to the AT&T monopoly before its breakup, the author argues that when the decision of what to broadcast or publish lies in the hands of a few, genuine debate is curtailed. This centralization of power, the article contends, erodes the foundations of a free society by limiting the diversity of voices and perspectives available to the public.</p>

          <p>A wave of intense, youth-led protests in Nepal, largely organized by "Gen Z" activists, has resulted in the overthrow of the government and the appointment of the country's first female prime minister, former chief justice Sushila Karki. The upheaval was fueled by widespread public anger over government corruption and the lavish lifestyles of political elites, which activists highlighted through viral social media campaigns. The protests turned violent after police opened fire on demonstrators, leading to the prime minister's resignation within 48 hours and marking a dramatic generational shift in the nation's politics.</p>

Instead of a popular vote, a new parliament will be chosen by appointed "electoral colleges," a method the transitional government says is necessary due to displacement and instability. However, critics, including civil society groups and minorities, argue the process is a "charade" that grants excessive power to the interim president and fails to establish a genuinely democratic foundation for the country's future.</p>
