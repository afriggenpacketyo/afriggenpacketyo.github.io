          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to upgrade their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a potential thaw in their strained relationship. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing, where Chinese officials expressed willingness to assist in improving relations between the two nations. Relations have been tense due to Pakistan's accusations that Afghanistan harbors the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees. The move aims to enhance bilateral cooperation across various domains, though no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021. The improved relations may help in regional stability and cooperation, as well as economic growth.</p>

          <p>Workers at the U.S. Department of Energy are raising alarms about cuts and deregulations that they say are undermining the department's ability to function effectively, which will likely lead to increased energy costs for consumers. Trump's proposed budget cuts of $19.3 billion and the elimination of 47 regulations are expected to have negative impacts on energy efficiency and innovation. Employees who have accepted resignation buyout offers express concerns about the long-term consequences of these changes, particularly for low-income households. A former senior official warns that the cuts will increase prices for consumers and make the U.S. less competitive internationally. The US Department of Energy refutes claims of costs due to eliminating regulations.</p>

Some industries, like industrial manufacturing, believe they are insulated from international competition, while others are adapting to the changing trade landscape. The unpredictability surrounding tariffs is disrupting supply chains and making logistical planning difficult for businesses. The situation is causing concern among business owners in the state.</p>

          <p>A rare gold lobster, named Calvin, was saved from being cooked at a restaurant in Rhode Island after a cook recognized its unique genetic mutation. This mutation, occurring in approximately one in 30 million lobsters, results in a yellowish-orange shell. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center, where he is now on display. Experts highlight that gold lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange ones, and boiling would have turned it red like any other cooked lobster. The lobster's rescue highlights both the rarity of the mutation and the importance of conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is facing severe staffing shortages as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches, raising concerns among meteorologists about the agency's ability to provide accurate forecasts and warnings. Staff cuts, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending, have led to the departure of approximately 550 Weather Service employees, including those at the National Hurricane Center. Several regional forecast offices are critically understaffed, potentially limiting their ability to issue timely alerts about incoming storms. Lawmakers and former agency leaders have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences if the agency is not adequately resourced. The situation is described as "uncharted territory."</p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has prompted discussion among experts about whether the U.S. might follow suit. While some Republicans have proposed raising the U.S. retirement age to address Social Security's looming depletion dates, experts caution that such a move could disproportionately harm lower-income individuals with shorter life expectancies. Denmark's more equal society makes raising the retirement age a more viable solution compared to the U.S. The article explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of raising the retirement age in the U.S.</p>

Former Meta employees fear that AI may not adequately address complex and sensitive issues related to privacy, youth risk, and content integrity. Meta claims that human expertise will still be used for novel and complex issues. The move reflects a broader trend of increasing reliance on AI within Meta.
