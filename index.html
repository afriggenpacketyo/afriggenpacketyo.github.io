          <p>The U.S. is urging Israel to conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Saif Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American. Musallet was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers while visiting family in the occupied West Bank. The incident has drawn condemnation and calls for accountability from U.S. officials and advocacy groups, highlighting a documented increase in settler violence against Palestinians in the region. Israeli authorities have reportedly arrested six individuals in connection with the killing as the U.S. State Department offers consular assistance to the family.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has refuted false rumors circulating on social media that suggest wildlife is fleeing Yellowstone National Park in large numbers. Officials state that viral videos showing herds of animals leaving are likely satirical or AI-generated, as there is no evidence of unusual migration patterns. Experts explain that some seasonal migration is normal, particularly in winter, but the current volcanic alert level is normal and there are no environmental triggers for a mass departure. The misinformation raises concerns about undermining public understanding of natural ecosystems and park operations.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the measures due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports. After receiving guarantees from the EU regarding its future energy security and gas prices, Slovakia has agreed to approve the package. The new sanctions, which require unanimous consent from all 27 member states, target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including its crucial Nordstream pipelines.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has recommended a single-day prison sentence for Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment building during the fatal 2020 raid, though none of his bullets struck anyone. This sentencing recommendation, which would amount to no additional jail time, is seen by critics as a significant reversal in the pursuit of police accountability. The move comes amid broader debates over police reform that were amplified by Taylor's death.</p>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, medical experts are providing context on the condition. CVI is a common circulatory issue, especially in older adults, where veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing swelling. The article explains that while the condition is often benign, diagnosis involves ruling out more serious issues like blood clots. Treatment typically involves non-surgical methods such as compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise to strengthen calf muscles, which aid circulation.</p>

The states claim the cuts jeopardize critical infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters like floods and hurricanes.

          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth minerals to China increased threefold, while its overall trade surplus with the nation narrowed significantly. This shift, detailed in a new report, is seen by analysts as a consequence of the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. As Beijing and Washington impose trade barriers on each other, China appears to be diversifying its supply chains for strategic minerals by turning to emerging economies like Brazil. The trend highlights the broader ripple effects of U.S.-China economic friction on global trade routes. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a tragedy and said an investigation is underway, while the Israel Defense Forces suggested fragments from a shell aimed at a military target may have mistakenly hit the church. The attack drew condemnation from Pope Leo XIV and the White House. The incident underscores the devastating impact of the conflict on civilians and protected sites within the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that her recent song 'Heterocomía' was a cathartic project, despite the high cost and low potential for profit. To create the track's introduction, she brokered an expensive deal with Disney to sample the theme from the 1970 film 'The Aristocats.' The song, which fans speculate is about a past relationship with a billionaire heir known for having heterochromia, contrasts a fairy-tale opening with lyrics about deception and revenge. Belinda stated that while she may never see royalties from the song, the personal satisfaction of creating it was worth the expense.</p>

          <p>President Trump would not recommend that the Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case, according to the White House press secretary. This statement follows the president's recent dismissal of the controversy surrounding his administration's handling of the Epstein files as a 'hoax.' The administration's stance has frustrated some of the president's own supporters and Republican lawmakers who have been calling for greater transparency and the release of all government records related to the case. The president has claimed that conspiracies about the case are being fueled by Democrats.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has indicated a willingness to redraw his state's congressional maps in a bid to help Democrats, directly responding to a Republican plan to do the same in Texas. While California voters established an independent redistricting commission to prevent such partisan gerrymandering, Newsom suggested the legislature could seek a way around it, arguing Democrats must counter GOP hardball tactics. The controversial proposal has been criticized by good-government groups as an 'attack on democracy' that undermines the very principles Democrats claim to defend.

Despite the strong results, the company warned that margins would be lower in the second half of the year due to high-cost content releases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how universities like Columbia and Harvard are responding to campus anti-Semitism by implementing measures that mirror the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) frameworks of the past decade. These steps include appointing new administrators and launching new training programs. The author notes the irony that these DEI-style initiatives are being created under pressure from the Trump administration, which has simultaneously sought to dismantle DEI programs elsewhere. Critics question whether this bureaucratic approach will be effective and warn it could lead to the same overreach and speech-policing concerns associated with previous DEI efforts.</p>

The vote proceeded along party lines, with Republican members approving the nomination while all Democrats on the panel walked out in protest. Bove's nomination has been highly controversial, drawing opposition from hundreds of former DOJ lawyers and retired judges. They raise concerns about his loyalty to the president and cite whistleblower allegations that he encouraged government lawyers to disobey court orders.</p>
