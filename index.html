        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keith Rabois, the co-founder and newly appointed board chair of Opendoor, has announced plans for a drastic workforce reduction, stating the company is "bloated" and needs to cut its 1,400-person staff down to 200. Rabois attributed the company's problems to a broken culture influenced by remote work and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which he vowed to fix. The online real-estate platform recently appointed a new CEO, Kaz Nejatian, and brought back co-founder Eric Wu to the board, moves that caused the company's stock to soar. Rabois asserted that these changes are necessary to resolve the company's significant cash burn and return to its innovative roots.</p>

          <p>An interview with Representative Ilhan Omar following the assassination of Charlie Kirk has sparked significant backlash from conservatives on social media. While Omar began by expressing condolences to Kirk's family, she also criticized his past rhetoric, calling his words and actions well-documented and condemning what she described as hypocrisy from some on the right. Critics, including prominent conservative figures and politicians, accused her of justifying the killing and called for her resignation, labeling her comments as evil. Omar defended her statements, asserting that she condemns all violence but will not ignore what she views as a history of hateful rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party is experiencing growing internal dissent following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's handling of Peter Mandelson's appointment and subsequent firing as ambassador to the US. Mandelson was dismissed after new information emerged about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, prompting criticism of Starmer's judgment. Labour MP Clive Lewis stated the prime minister "doesn't seem up to the job" and described a "dangerous atmosphere" among MPs who feel the party is failing the country. The chaotic week has fueled frustration within the party, with some directing anger at the prime minister's chief of staff and calling for significant changes in leadership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed an agent on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance after he made negative comments on Facebook about the recently assassinated conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The agent, Anthony Pough, wrote that Kirk had "spewed hate and racism" and suggested he was facing karma. In an internal memo, Secret Service Director Sean Curran emphasized that agents must operate without political bias and serve as a solution to, not a cause of, the rise in politically motivated attacks. The agency stated it will not tolerate behavior that violates its code of conduct and has launched a formal investigation into the matter.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Consumer Sentiment Declines to Lowest Level Since May Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 14:16:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment fell in September to its lowest point in four months, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary survey. The decline reflects growing public concern over multiple economic vulnerabilities, including risks to business conditions, the labor market, and persistent inflation. A significant number of consumers, approximately 60%, specifically mentioned tariff policies as a top concern, recognizing their potential impact on product prices and personal finances. This growing awareness is also reflected in rising long-run inflation expectations, suggesting Americans are becoming more cautious with their spending as they anticipate further price hikes.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police has suspended nine officers and referred itself to the police watchdog following a BBC investigation into conduct at Charing Cross station. The allegations, which will be featured in a Panorama documentary, include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failure to report misconduct.

This incident follows a 2022 IOPC report that found disgraceful behavior within the same station, adding to a series of scandals that have plagued the force.</p>

This article explores the duality of his legacy, acknowledging his willingness to engage with opponents on college campuses but also noting his staunch support for Donald Trump's election fraud claims and his organization's inflammatory tactics. The piece argues against both whitewashing his controversial actions and justifying his murder, emphasizing that condemning political violence is paramount. It suggests that a responsible public discourse must reject extremism while upholding the principles of peaceful disagreement in a democracy.</p>

The debate pitted musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister and Frank Zappa against the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), co-founded by Tipper Gore. The PMRC argued for a labeling system to help parents guide their children's listening habits, framing it as "truth in packaging" rather than censorship. Despite opposition from artists who defended their creative expression, the PMRC successfully negotiated a deal with the recording industry, establishing the voluntary warning labels that are still in use today.</p>

          <p>Following the successful public debut of their company Gemini, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have made a bold prediction that the price of a single bitcoin will reach $1 million within the next ten years. The twins argue that bitcoin is still in the "bottom of the first inning" of its growth and view it as a superior alternative to gold as a store of value. They believe the cryptocurrency has the potential for at least a tenfold increase from its current price. Their forecast comes as Gemini's IPO was priced above its expected range, reflecting strong investor interest in the regulated digital asset market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of the Vancouver Association of Educational Support Professionals (VAESP) have overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike if a new contract agreement is not reached with Vancouver Public Schools. The union, which represents over 800 paraeducators, clerks, and other support staff, has been negotiating since April and working without a contract since August 31. Key sticking points include management's proposals to remove layoff protections and compensation for student-inflicted injuries. The union is also seeking adequate pay, increased staffing, and better leave policies, with the next mediation session scheduled to continue the discussions.</p>

          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has publicly condemned an anonymous insider at the club for leaking a media report suggesting he was trying to engineer an exit from his contract. Rodgers labeled the action as "cowardly" and stated that the person responsible should leave the club, emphasizing the need for support in his high-pressure role. The report emerged amid a challenging period for the team, following a failure to qualify for the Champions League and a frustrating transfer window that Rodgers described as leaving him feeling "empty." Despite the internal friction and on-field challenges, he affirmed his 100% commitment to staying and helping the club improve.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of the September 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump, began with the judge cutting short his unconventional opening statement. Routh, who is representing himself, is charged with attempting to kill the then-presidential candidate at a Florida golf resort. Prosecutors allege he meticulously planned the attack, purchasing a military-grade rifle and tracking Trump's movements. During his brief remarks, Routh touched on topics from human evolution to Adolf Hitler before being reprimanded by Judge Aileen Cannon for not mounting a meaningful defense, highlighting the unusual nature of the proceedings.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, a narrative framing him as a Christian martyr is gaining traction among some right-wing religious and political figures, sparking calls for vengeance. While many have expressed mournful sympathy, influential leaders have described his death as a spiritual battle, with some supporters chanting slogans like "White men, fight back!" at vigils. This rhetoric is concerning to experts on extremism, who worry that glorifying Kirk could intensify political polarization and incite violence. The activist, who often spoke of a spiritual war against the left, is now being positioned as a symbol of a fight for conservative Christian values.</p>

          <p>A South African court has denied an application from convicted murderer and sex offender Thabo Bester to block the release of a Netflix documentary about his case. Bester, known as the "Facebook Rapist," argued that the film, "Beauty and the Bester," was defamatory and would violate his right to a fair trial. He gained international attention after faking his own death by fire in a dramatic prison escape, only to be arrested a year later in Tanzania. The judge dismissed the urgent application, ruling that the case is already in the public domain, though Bester remains free to pursue a defamation lawsuit after the documentary airs.</p>

Beyond personnel issues, the team acknowledges a failure to execute situational hitting and maintain competitive "team at-bats," leading to wasted opportunities.

          <p>A bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales is facing significant opposition during its review in the House of Lords, with former Prime Minister Theresa May being a prominent critic. May referred to the legislation as an "assisted suicide bill," arguing it lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent vulnerable people from being pressured into ending their lives. The bill's sponsor in the Commons, Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, expressed discomfort with this framing, stating that the terminally ill people she has met are not suicidal but are seeking choice in the face of inevitable death. The debate has drawn emotional pleas from both sides, with many peers sharing personal stories of loss.</p>

The statement came after President Trump declared such an attack on the U.S. ally "will not happen again," having been notified by the military just as it occurred. Qatar, which hosts a major U.S. military base and has acted as a key mediator in ceasefire talks, condemned the strike as a criminal violation of international law.

The move shelves, for now, the controversial plan to deploy troops to Chicago as part of "Operation Midway Blitz," which had drawn strong opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. Trump claimed the Memphis deployment has the support of both Tennessee's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor.</p>
