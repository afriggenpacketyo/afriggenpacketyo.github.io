          <p>Society often prioritizes romantic relationships over friendships, but strong platonic bonds are essential for well-being. Historically, friendships held significant importance, with men and women expressing deep affection for their friends. Cultural shifts and the sexualization of same-sex affection led to the prioritization of romantic partnerships. Maintaining friendships requires intentional effort, especially when entering a romantic relationship, and feelings of jealousy or sadness are common but shouldn't be cause for shame. By valuing friendships alongside romantic love, individuals can create a more balanced and supportive network.</p>

          <p>Experts are debating the merits of President Donald Trump's proposal for 'Trump Accounts,' which would provide a $1,000 baby bonus to children born between 2025 and 2029. Supporters highlight the potential for long-term growth through investment, while critics express concerns about the program's cost and complexity. Some suggest that universal savings accounts or 529 college savings plans could be more effective alternatives. The debate centers on how best to encourage savings and financial security for future generations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), the largest Protestant denomination in the US, has endorsed a resolution calling for the overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v Hodges, that legalized same-sex marriage. Human rights groups have condemned the resolution, arguing that it represents an attack on the LGBTQ+ community. The SBC, which has long opposed same-sex marriage, has around 13 million members and 47,000 cooperating churches. This decision marks the first time the convention has voted to end the right to same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party is criticizing Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Â£3.4 billion deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of a UK-US military base. Conservatives question why British taxpayers should fund tax cuts in Mauritius, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch calling it a "terrible" deal. Sir Keir Starmer defended the deal, stating it was necessary to secure the vital intelligence and strategic capability of the base on Diego Garcia. The agreement involves the UK leasing the base for 99 years and making annual payments to Mauritius, with the funds earmarked for debt repayment and tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's legal team is seeking to move the appeal of his New York hush money conviction from state appellate courts to federal court. His attorney argues that the case involves official acts undertaken while Trump was president and should be heard in a federal forum. Prosecutors argue that it's too late to move the case and that the purpose of removal is to decide where to hold the trial, not to divert a state criminal proceeding into a federal court for direct appellate review. The appeals court will consider the arguments, with the decision potentially shifting the legal battle to the federal level.</p>

The appeals court rejected this argument, stating that even without the member's vote, a tie would not have resulted in a clemency recommendation. Hanson's attorneys plan to appeal to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and he has a separate appeal pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
