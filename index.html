          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserted that the Trump administration's attempts to silence pro-Palestinian voices have been unsuccessful. Speaking after arriving in New Jersey, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants still detained. He accused the White House of trying to dehumanize dissenters, while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez highlighted Khalil's release as evidence of the administration's losing legal battle against migrants advocating for Palestinians. A judge ordered Khalil's release after determining he posed no flight risk or threat, though the Trump administration plans to appeal. The context of this article involves the ongoing tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian activism and immigration policies. The article reflects a tone of defiance and continued advocacy. </p>

          <p>A flight passenger's social media rant about airline standby practices has ignited a heated debate online as the summer travel season gets underway. The passenger expressed frustration over being placed on standby despite booking weeks in advance, accusing airlines of overselling flights and acting like they are doing customers a favor. Many commenters echoed these sentiments, criticizing airlines for prioritizing their own interests over customer convenience and for not taking responsibility for overbooking. Some commenters suggested that the passenger may have missed the check-in window or purchased a basic fare. With July 4th approaching, a record number of Americans are expected to travel this year, putting further strain on the airline industry. </p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin, calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrators in Berlin criticized German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comment that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran, fearing wider regional devastation. In London, protesters waved Palestinian flags and carried signs advocating for an end to arming Israel and opposing war with Iran. These protests occur against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and famine-like conditions in Gaza.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian rights activist, has been reunited with his family in New Jersey after being released from ICE detention. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was held for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. He was released after a judge ruled his detention unconstitutional and found no evidence he was a flight risk or danger to the public. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights, while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of First Amendment rights. This event follows a series of similar arrests of international students who have spoken out about Israel, raising concerns about freedom of speech. </p>

Garcia believes he was targeted because the agents assumed he was undocumented. This incident is part of a series of detentions in the Los Angeles area, raising concerns about potential civil rights violations during immigration enforcement operations. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents the administration from capping indirect costs for universities at 15%, a move that could have stripped institutions of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the policy change arbitrary and contrary to law, siding with universities that argued the cuts would threaten critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Similar caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges. The context of this article involves the ongoing debate over federal funding for scientific research. </p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed has criticized President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested that Trump's stance may be driven by political motives, particularly in light of potential military action against Iran. He noted that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified weeks ago that the intelligence community continues to assess that Iran has not authorized a nuclear weapons program. Reed argued that if Gabbard's testimony was inaccurate, it should be corrected immediately, rather than dismissed following actions by Israel. </p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures surpassing 33C, as a Met Office warning for thunderstorms came into effect. A temperature of 33.2C was recorded in Charlwood, near Gatwick. A yellow weather warning is in place for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and north-east Wales due to expected storms. Passengers were forced to evacuate a train in south London due to a fault, and wildfires have surged across England and Wales. Fresh research suggests nearly 600 people could die in the next four days because of the heat in England and Wales. </p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly moving B-2 bombers to Guam as President Trump weighs whether to participate in Israel's strikes against Iran. It remains unclear if the bomber deployment is connected to Middle East tensions. The B-2 bomber can carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, potentially used to strike Iran's nuclear program. This deployment follows reports of increased tanker aircraft movement to Europe and other military assets to the Middle East. The news comes as Israel claims to have killed a veteran Iranian commander and Iran states it will not negotiate its nuclear program under threat. </p>

Boelter's wife told investigators that they were "preppers" and that her husband instructed her to leave their home because "people with guns may be showing up." Law enforcement found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. Yvette Hoffman, who survived the attack, recounted the terrifying night, stating that they were woken up by someone impersonating an officer. The Hoffmans' daughter called 911, triggering a warning that a "politically motivated act was potentially underway." </p>

The tragedy has fueled speculation about whether the family's extreme isolation and rigid rules may have contributed to a mental health crisis.
