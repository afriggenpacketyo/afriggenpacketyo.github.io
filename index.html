          <p>The European Union is engaging in complex trade negotiations with the United States and China, aiming to secure economic advantages from both while navigating the challenges of their strained relationship. The EU seeks to avoid being caught in the middle as the U.S. pressures countries to cut ties with China, and officials in Brussels describe the situation as a "high-wire act." Complicating matters further, the U.S. and China are also approaching their own negotiations, leaving Europe at risk of being sidelined in the evolving geopolitical landscape. The EU must carefully manage these relationships to achieve its economic goals without alienating either superpower.</p>

          <p>Shachi Kurl analyzes the challenges facing Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, including economic concerns, strained relationships with the U.S. due to President Trump's policies, and deteriorating bilateral ties with China and India. The article suggests Canada needs to redefine its global role beyond its relationship with America, focusing on trade agreements with Britain and the European Union. Kurl emphasizes the importance of meeting NATO military spending guidelines and avoiding rhetorical missteps that plagued the previous administration, as Canada seeks to secure its economic and strategic future. The country's upcoming role as host to the Business 7 summit and the Group of 7 presents a critical opportunity for a reset on the global stage.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, a move expected to have significant socio-economic and political consequences. This decision could lead to increased demands for raising quotas in government jobs and college admissions for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The last time India counted all castes was in 1931 under British rule; since then, only Dalits and Adivasis have been counted. While supporters argue this data is essential for effectively implementing social justice programs, critics fear it could exacerbate social unrest. The announcement comes before a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a major issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed Americans to purchase cheap goods from China without tariffs, a move intended to support U.S. manufacturers but likely to raise prices for online shoppers. This rule previously allowed products valued up to $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, leading to a surge in small packages from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The administration cited concerns over the loophole being exploited for fentanyl trafficking and its negative impact on U.S. warehousing and logistics jobs. While supporters argue it will protect American industries, opponents fear higher prices and disruptions to trade.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Center Health Program has resumed certifying illnesses linked to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, restoring access to treatment for cancer patients and first responders. This comes after weeks of uncertainty caused by administrative issues, including the layoff and alleged reinstatement of the program's administrator, Dr. John Howard. The restoration of certification processing means that the program can now review and approve claims from responders and survivors who have developed new conditions linked to the attacks.

          <p>The elimination of the de minimis rule, which allowed tariff-free imports of goods valued under $800, has significantly impacted e-commerce trade between China and the United States. This policy change, initiated in 2016, had enabled Chinese companies to directly reach American consumers with low-priced goods. The recent measure, however, subjects most packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to tariffs, leading to higher prices for American shoppers and challenges for Chinese exporters. Some factories in southern China have already suspended operations, raising concerns about potential job losses as the trade tensions escalate.</p>

          <p>Israel's military launched airstrikes near Syria's presidential palace in Damascus, following warnings from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government that it would intervene if Syrian authorities failed to protect the Druze minority.

The Israeli government has stated that it will not allow Syrian forces to deploy south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community. This marks the second time Israel has struck Syria in as many days, reflecting Israel's deep mistrust of Sunni Islamists.</p>

          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is undergoing a recount with Reform UK and Labour separated by only four votes. The vote, triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, is Sir Keir Starmer's first major electoral test as prime minister. While Labour held the North Tyneside and Doncaster mayoralties by narrow margins, Reform is hoping to make further gains in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest and in council elections. Support for Reform UK has been rising in national polls since last year's general election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, leading to increased prices for U.S. customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. These Chinese online retail giants relied on the "de minimis" exemption to ship low-value items directly to the U.S. without duties or import taxes. The move, aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and supporting American businesses, has already prompted price adjustments by Shein and Temu. The change is expected to significantly raise costs for consumers and impact trade flows.</p>

          <p>Pakistan is grappling with economic hardship, political resignation, and the fear of armed conflict with India, creating a sense of weariness among the public. Conversations are less about battles and borders and more about inflation, unemployment, and a political system that feels unrepresentative. The military, traditionally a unifying force, now faces more complicated emotions as political turmoil and economic crises deepen anxiety. Despite the challenges, Pakistanis remain resilient, using dark humor to cope with the situation. Many young Pakistanis see hope only in leaving the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, blocking federal funding to the maximum extent allowed by law. The order also prevents indirect funding to PBS and NPR by prohibiting local public radio and television stations from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations. The White House claims that NPR and PBS have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars, though both news organizations are primarily funded through a combination of public and private sources.</p>

          <p>The United States has secured a deal to share the rights to Ukraine’s mineral reserves, which include elements crucial for high-tech applications, but the path to extraction is fraught with challenges and uncertainty.

President Trump has touted the potential windfall for the U.S., which aims to reduce its vulnerability to China's dominance in mineral extraction and processing.

          <p>The Senate approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule tied to the Clean Air Act, designed to limit seven hazardous air pollutants emitted by heavy industry. The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law. The rule, finalized by the Biden administration in 2024, required all "major" sources of these pollutants to maintain strict pollution controls. Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution, while environmental groups blasted the move as endangering public health.</p>
