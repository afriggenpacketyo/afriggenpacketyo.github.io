          <p>Catastrophic flooding in central Texas has resulted in at least 70 fatalities, with the majority occurring in Kerr County. Federal assistance has been activated following a major disaster declaration by President Trump, mobilizing FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard for extensive search and rescue operations. Officials are particularly concerned about a group of campers and a counselor who remain missing from a summer camp located along the Guadalupe River. The coordinated response involves state and local leaders working to manage the crisis and provide resources for recovery.</p>

          <h2>Texas Catastrophe Highlights Challenges of Forecasting Extreme Weather in Climate Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 13:10:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The devastating floods in Texas underscore the difficulties in predicting extreme weather events exacerbated by the climate crisis. Despite timely warnings from the National Weather Service, the rainfall's intensity, equivalent to a 1-in-1,000-year event, far exceeded initial forecasts. This incident reveals the limitations of current forecasting technology in pinpointing the exact location and severity of such downpours, a challenge compounded by staffing shortages at federal agencies. The event serves as a stark example of a complex, compound tragedy becoming more frequent due to climate warming.</p>

          <p>Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel secured victory in the second stage of the Tour de France, narrowly defeating Tadej Pogacar in a thrilling sprint finish. The win on the 209.1km route from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer also earned him the coveted yellow jersey as the overall race leader. The stage remained relatively calm until the final 40km, where a series of climbs and attacks fractured the peloton. Van der Poel, who last won a Tour stage in 2021, successfully capitalized on the challenging finale to claim the win.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed on a crucial point. The system did not make a call on a long shot from Kartal, forcing the umpire to order a replay of the point, which Kartal then won. Pavlyuchenkova expressed frustration, stating the game was "stolen" from her, and questioned why the umpire didn't overrule the technology. The All England Club later attributed the malfunction to operator error, highlighting a rare but significant issue with the new automated system.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men, most of whom are not South Sudanese nationals, to South Sudan after a protracted legal battle. The men, convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were sent to the unstable nation because their home countries reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had required due process hearings for such cases. This action is part of a broader administration effort to expand deportations to third countries, a policy that has drawn significant criticism and raised concerns about the fate of the deportees.</p>

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) has condemned an attack on a Deutsche Welle (DW) news team in the occupied West Bank. A DW correspondent and cameraman were chased and had stones thrown at them by Israeli settlers while covering a protest against settler violence. While the journalists were unharmed, their vehicle was badly damaged, and they were clearly identified as press. DW's Director General and Germany's ambassador to Israel have called for the safety of all journalists to be guaranteed, emphasizing that press freedom is a pillar of democracy.</p>

          <p>Military experts in China are advocating for structural reforms within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to more effectively counter threats from unmanned aircraft. Writing in the official PLA Daily, they suggest the eventual creation of specialized counter-drone combat units capable of rapid response. In the near term, they propose integrating these capabilities into existing units, such as upgrading electronic warfare teams to handle AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming. This focus reflects the increasingly critical role that drones have played in recent global conflicts, including the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow has released a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the man who redefined American literature. The article highlights Twain's journey from a boy in Hannibal, Missouri, to a global literary icon whose sardonic humor was often rooted in personal pain and a fear of poverty. Chernow discusses how themes in Twain's work—such as politics, race, and money—remain highly relevant today. The book delves into the complexities of a writer who engaged deeply with the Black community and used his fame to speak truth to power.</p>

Burns emphasized that public broadcasting is crucial for rural areas, providing essential services like children's programming, educational content, and emergency information. He argued that these are good American institutions that serve everyone and are vital for producing in-depth work that commercial outlets would not support.</p>

The journey to a U.S.- and Israel-supported distribution site involved dodging Israeli military fire, confronting armed contractors, and fighting through desperate crowds. The lack of order has led to daily casualties and the rise of armed thieves who prey on those carrying supplies. This report highlights the extreme hunger and lawlessness gripping Gaza, where the simple act of acquiring food has become a life-threatening ordeal for the population.</p>

Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can come across as dismissive or condescending, even when the speaker's intent is to be helpful or correct. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" instead of offering an immediate solution.

A key example is the new grand mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey's religious authority, which was inaugurated alongside agreements on agriculture, education, and drone donations. This soft power projection is part of a broader geopolitical strategy where Turkish investors and construction firms, often with ties to President Erdogan, lead major projects across the region, from railways to hotels, to assert Turkey's role as a regional power.</p>
