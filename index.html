        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to provisional data from the CDC, the number of births in the United States increased by 1% in 2024, totaling approximately 3.6 million, marking a slight rebound after a prolonged decline since the Great Recession. Demographers caution against interpreting this as a definitive trend reversal, citing ongoing economic uncertainties and challenges faced by families regarding housing and childcare costs. The report also indicates a record-low number of teenage births and a continued increase in births among women aged 40-44, with Hispanic and Asian women contributing significantly to the rise in birth rates. The Trump administration is reportedly considering policies to encourage married heterosexual couples to have children, while the report does not address the impact of abortion bans on birth rates. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>CNBC's The China Connection newsletter reports that U.S. regulatory scrutiny, spurred by President Trump's "America First Investment Policy" memo, is intensifying concerns about the potential delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. The memo calls for a review of U.S. investments in Chinese entities and renewed scrutiny of publicly traded Chinese companies. The House Select Committee on China is also pressuring investment banks to withdraw from underwriting the Hong Kong IPO of a Chinese battery giant. China's securities regulator has sought to increase its oversight of domestic companies listing overseas. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>Netflix and Sonia Friedman Productions have brought "Stranger Things: The First Shadow" to Broadway, creating a spectacle that blends the fluidity of the screen with the dynamism of the stage. The play, a prequel to the Netflix series, is set in 1959 and explores the backstory of Henry Creel and other familiar characters. While the production boasts impressive visual effects and technological know-how, the plot is criticized for being convoluted and overly ambitious, akin to squeezing an entire season of the series into a single play. The production is directed by Tony-winning veteran Stephen Daldry with co-director Justin Martin. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that he has no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite his repeated criticisms of the Fed's monetary policy.

          <p>Tesla is carefully considering entering the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, as the electric vehicle manufacturer confronts declining sales and tariff-related challenges. Taneja acknowledged India's potential due to its large middle class, but noted the country's high import tariffs and luxury taxes could double the price of Tesla vehicles. The company is working to determine the optimal timing for market entry, navigating the complexities of India's protectionist policies. These statements follow discussions between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding potential collaboration on technology and innovation. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>China should upgrade its punishment for academic misconduct, a chronic problem threatening the nation’s innovation push , according to an opinion piece in People’s Daily. The article said that despite efforts to strengthen research integrity, misconduct was still frequent, in part because of weak penalties. Such violations “waste scarce research resources, undermine a fair and competitive research environment, shake the foundations of technological innovation, and damage the international reputation of China’s scientific community”. The call comes as China accelerates its hi-tech drive , prioritising technological self-sufficiency and innovation in response to its escalating technological competition with the United States.

With exports to its biggest market in the US likely to be hit by higher tariffs, the nation’s producers are projected to trim their capital expenditure by 10 to 20 per cent this year, according to consultancy WaterRock Energy Economics.
