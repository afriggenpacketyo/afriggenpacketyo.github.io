        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The retail industry is responding with cautious relief to President Trump's tentative trade deal with Vietnam, which sets import tariffs at 20% instead of the initially proposed 46%. While this revised rate is seen as more manageable than the higher levy, executives still express significant concerns about its potential negative impact on consumer spending and profit margins. Many companies, including major brands like Nike, are planning to raise prices to offset these new costs, creating uncertainty about how these increases will ultimately affect consumers. This agreement, though a step back from the steepest tariffs, still presents considerable economic implications for the retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The prosecution detailed his repeated presence near the victims' home and the meticulous cleanup of his car and apartment post-murders. Despite solving the case, the specific motive and why Kohberger targeted these particular victims, who appeared to be strangers, remain unanswered questions for the families.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is currently awaiting sentencing after being found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution following his federal trial. Although acquitted of the more severe charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, Judge Arun Subramanian ordered his continued detention, citing concerns about flight risk given his wealth. Each conviction carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, meaning Combs could face up to 20 years in prison, though legal experts suggest a more likely outcome of four to five years. His sentencing is tentatively set for October 3, 2025, with an expedited schedule being discussed.</p>

          <p>Significant economic uncertainty is escalating as the 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, with President Trump signaling no plans for an extension. If these new country-specific tariffs are implemented, they could substantially increase duties on billions of dollars in foreign imports, potentially triggering a new wave of inflation and adversely affecting businesses. Trade experts anticipate a varied outcome, with some nations securing finalized deals, others maintaining a 10% baseline tariff, and a third group facing sharply higher duties. This ongoing uncertainty is seen as detrimental to investment and overall economic expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven individuals remain "unaccounted for" following a series of explosions and a large fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, Yolo County, Northern California. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics, which prompted mandatory evacuations, caused several structures on the property to catch fire and spread into approximately 80 acres of grass. While two people were reported injured and received medical care, officials have not confirmed any fatalities, as families anxiously await news of their missing loved ones. Investigations are ongoing, with unexploded fireworks still detonating at the site and local power outages persisting.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has opted not to hear a dispute concerning a Montana law that would have required notarized parental consent for minors to obtain an abortion. This decision effectively upholds the Montana Supreme Court's ruling, which previously struck down the law based on state constitutional grounds. Proponents of the law argued for parents' constitutional right to control their children's care, while opponents, including Planned Parenthood, asserted minors' constitutional right to privacy. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch concurred with declining the case, suggesting it was an unsuitable platform for addressing the broader question of parental rights.</p>

Major carriers such as Southwest and Delta have already withdrawn their 2025 forecasts, citing broader economic uncertainty, including the fluctuating impact of Trump administration tariffs and a decline in overseas visitors.

Insurers favor these upgrades because they demonstrably reduce the probability and severity of common claims, including weather damage and electrical fires. Conversely, purely cosmetic renovations or additions like swimming pools typically do not lower costs and might even increase premiums due to higher replacement values or increased liability.

While the Supreme Court upheld their inclusion, the BJP lacks the two-thirds parliamentary majority needed for such amendments, and significant opposition exists. Critics warn that raising this debate fuels polarization and anxiety among minorities, signaling a potential shift towards majoritarian politics ahead of the 2029 elections.</p>

          <p>A top Atlanta Police Department official, Marshall Freeman, is facing accusations of ethics violations for consulting with a tech company whose surveillance software is integral to the city's extensive system, all while holding an investment in and serving on the company's board. An ethics investigation concluded that Freeman violated city laws concerning disclosure and the use of city property, thereby creating an "appearance of impropriety." This case underscores broader concerns about the opaque relationships between private foundations, police departments, and technology firms, which can expand policing capabilities without adequate public oversight, as Freeman previously facilitated the purchase of the Fusus software for APD.</p>

          <p>A veteran Chinese diplomat has issued a stark warning, asserting that the Trump administration's national security mindset could push humanity towards more conflicts and even "shared destruction." Liu, who heads the Communist Party‚Äôs diplomatic arm, criticized this rhetoric as a "new embodiment of hegemonic thinking," contending that it actively stirs up confrontation and conflict rather than fostering peace and harmony. This statement reflects significant apprehension from China regarding the U.S. approach to global relations, highlighting a profound divergence in diplomatic philosophies and the potential for escalating international tensions.</p>
