          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has announced contract awards of up to $200 million each for Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI. This funding, managed by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, aims to accelerate the military's adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address national security challenges. The initiative will involve developing AI agents for various mission areas. This move comes as xAI also launches "Grok for Government," a suite of AI products for U.S. government customers, despite recent controversy over its chatbot's content.</p>

          <p>AI startup Cognition is acquiring Windsurf, another AI coding company, in a deal that includes its intellectual property, product, and talent. The acquisition follows a recent bidding war where Google hired Windsurf's CEO and senior employees in a multi-billion dollar licensing and compensation package after an OpenAI acquisition fell through. Cognition's CEO, Scott Wu, assured that all Windsurf employees would be treated with fairness and respect. The move highlights the intense competition for top talent within the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence industry.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced he will remain in the New York City mayoral race as an independent candidate. However, he has agreed to a proposal to withdraw if a September poll shows another candidate has a stronger chance of defeating the presumptive Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo is positioning himself as a moderate alternative, while other candidates like incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa have rejected the polling pact. The decision sets up a complex multi-way race for the November general election.</p>

The funds, which support programs for teacher training, after-school activities, and English language learners, were abruptly halted on June 30 for a "review" to ensure alignment with presidential priorities. The lawsuit argues the freeze is illegal and has caused "chaos" for school districts, which had already budgeted for the expected funds just weeks before the academic year begins.

          <p>Samuel Bond Haskell IV, who was charged with murdering his wife and her parents, has died in a Los Angeles County jail from an apparent suicide. Haskell, the son of an Emmy-winning producer, was found with self-inflicted injuries in his cell just days before his preliminary hearing was set to begin. He was arrested in November 2023 after a human torso was discovered in a dumpster, with police later finding evidence of a dismemberment at his home. His death is the 26th in the L.A. County jail system this year, adding to concerns about a crisis in the facilities.</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, delivered a player-of-the-match performance to secure a dramatic 22-run Test victory against India at Lord's. Despite a recent hamstring surgery and an injury scare earlier in the match, Stokes bowled two long, grueling spells on the final day, taking crucial wickets. He described the effort as one of the "dark places" he has gone to physically during a match. The tense on-field atmosphere, which included a fine for an Indian player and a collision between players, has added extra heat to the series as England goes up 2-1.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma farmer, Bradley McMichael, was killed by two water buffaloes he had purchased at a livestock auction just the day before the incident. First responders were called to his farm in Jones, Oklahoma, but were initially unable to reach McMichael due to the animals' aggressive behavior. They had to put down one of the buffaloes to access the victim, who had suffered fatal lacerations. The second animal was also later put down after becoming agitated and posing a threat to emergency personnel on the scene.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is continuing to cool, with annual home price growth slowing to just 1.3% in June, its lowest rate in two years. According to mortgage technology firm ICE, nearly one-third of the 100 largest housing markets are now experiencing annual price declines. This trend is driven by a combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling buyer demand. While prices are still rising in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening significantly in the South and West, with markets in Florida, Texas, and California seeing notable drops.

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been intermittently suspended due to a renewed flood threat. Heavy rains have caused the Guadalupe and San Saba Rivers to rise again, creating dangerous conditions for volunteer and official search crews. The initial holiday flooding killed at least 132 people, with about 160 still considered missing in the rural Hill Country region. Authorities have issued new flood warnings and urged extreme caution, particularly around low-water crossings that can quickly become impassable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "very big deal" with NATO allies to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of military equipment, including Patriot missile systems. Under the plan, European nations will provide the weapons from their own stocks, which will then be replenished by the United States, with Europe footing the bill. Simultaneously, Trump issued a 50-day ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war or face severe 100% secondary tariffs on countries that trade with Russia. The announcement signals a significant shift in the administration's approach, combining substantial military support for Kyiv with a direct economic threat to Moscow.</p>

          <p>This article examines the "age 75 rule," a common but informal belief that one should wait until age 75 to purchase an annuity to receive higher payouts. While it is true that monthly payments are larger for older buyers due to shorter life expectancy, the rule oversimplifies retirement planning. Waiting until 75 may mean forgoing years of guaranteed income and facing risks like market downturns or changes in personal health that could limit options. Experts advise that the best time to buy an annuity depends on individual goals and financial situation, not an arbitrary age. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. While products like Zyn are tobacco-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic and even fatal to small children. Researchers analyzing calls to U.S. poison centers found that while pouch ingestions are a small fraction of all nicotine exposures, they are more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. Health advocates are calling for a ban on flavored nicotine products.</p>
