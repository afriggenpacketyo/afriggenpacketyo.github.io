        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Widespread "No Kings" protests against President Trump's policies have begun across major U.S. cities, including New York and Washington D.C., drawing thousands of participants. Organizers emphasize the peaceful nature of these demonstrations, advocating for democracy against perceived authoritarianism, despite accusations from Trump allies linking them to the far-left Antifa movement. Ahead of the rallies, Republican governors in several states, like Texas and Virginia, placed National Guard troops on standby, though local reports indicated varied visibility. This move drew sharp condemnation from Democrats, who characterized the deployment of armed soldiers against peaceful protests as an act of kings and dictators, further highlighting deep divisions regarding the administration's actions and presidential power.</p>

          <p>Hamas has stated it delivered all Israeli hostage remains it could retrieve from Gaza, with two more bodies recently transferred to Israeli authorities for identification, leaving at least 16 still unaccounted for. The return of all hostages, both living and deceased, is a cornerstone of the Gaza peace plan, which Hamas has been accused of delaying. U.S. advisers acknowledge the immense destruction in Gaza makes recovery difficult, even sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas and accepting Turkey's offer of expert search teams. However, the peace deal faces further hurdles, including Hamas's rejection of disarmament, a condition Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu insists upon for a lasting resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release from federal prison. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, was serving an 87-month sentence and was ordered to pay restitution, which he will now no longer have to do. Trump cited Santos' "horrible mistreatment" and solitary confinement as reasons for the commutation. The decision sparked criticism from fellow Republicans like Congressman Nick LaLota, who argued Santos' crimes warranted a longer sentence and continued restitution. A commutation differs from a pardon, meaning Santos' record remains intact.</p>

          <p>The Kalshi trading platform experienced significant glitches and delays for nearly half its user base during Saturday's college football games, a major event for its traders. Users reported being unable to process orders or accurately view their balances and bets, though a company spokesperson denied a full outage, stating the exchange "never stopped functioning properly" for clearing or institutional trading. This technical issue arose shortly after Kalshi announced a substantial $300 million Series D funding round, which valued the company at $5 billion, more than double its previous valuation. The platform, known for allowing users to trade on a wide range of real-world events, faced user frustration despite its recent rapid growth and investment success.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew, younger brother of King Charles III, has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, following renewed scrutiny over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The decision, made in discussion with the King and other family members, aims to prevent further distraction from royal duties, though he will retain his birth title of Prince. Andrew had previously stepped back from public life and returned military titles in 2019 and 2022, respectively. He settled a sexual assault lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre in 2022, consistently denying her allegations, and her posthumous memoir detailing her claims is set for publication next week.</p>

Tasting Table's ranking, based on reviews and local buzz, features establishments like Cleveland's Harbor Inn Cafe, which opened in 1895, and New Orleans' windowless Snake and Jake's Christmas Club Lounge. Many of these cherished community hubs boast rich histories, some over a century old, having overcome tribulations like multiple fires, while continuing to offer cheap drinks and lively entertainment.</p>

          <p>The article identifies four common investing mistakes made by the newly wealthy, a group that saw 379,000 new millionaires in the U.S. last year. These pitfalls include poor tax planning, such as overlooking the tax implications of dividend-paying portfolios, which can erode wealth over time. Another mistake is ignoring conventional investment strategies in favor of riskier assets like cryptocurrency or private equity, often driven by a short-game mindset rather than long-term security. Finally, feeling obligated to invest in friends' or family members' businesses without proper due diligence can also lead to significant financial detriment. (not investment advice)</p>

While Brown criticized the "amateur hour" driving, and Stella expressed disappointment, former world champion Damon Hill suggested Piastri lacked awareness in the first corner.

          <p>A former acting director of ICE, John Sandweg, has criticized President Trump's immigration crackdown, asserting that federal agents are being placed in a "terrible position" and deployed to cities where they are ill-suited. Sandweg argues that Border Patrol agents, trained for high-risk desert operations, are now applying overwhelming force in urban settings, leading to viral incidents like tear gas deployment in Chicago. He states that while agents follow use-of-force policies similar to local law enforcement, the administration's directives not to "back down" create unprecedented confrontations. A federal judge has since ordered agents in Chicago to wear body cameras, reflecting growing concerns over these tactics.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his royal titles has significant repercussions for his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who will now revert to her maiden name, losing her "Duchess of York" courtesy title. Royal commentators suggest this will diminish her public "cachet," especially following recent controversies over an email linking her to Jeffrey Epstein. While Ferguson is known as a "survivor" in royal circles and maintains various business ventures, these are more likely to be impacted by her own Epstein-related scandals than the title change. Their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, however, retain their birth titles and remain largely untarnished by the ongoing family controversies.</p>

          <p>Vermont State Senator Samuel Douglass, a Republican, has resigned following the exposure of racist and antisemitic messages within a Young Republican group chat. Douglass apologized for his comments, citing a need to ensure his family's safety amidst threats of violence he and his wife received. The leaked chat, which also contained homophobic slurs and jokes about gas chambers and sexual assault, led to the revocation of the New York state Young Republicans’ charter. While some, like VP Vance, downplayed the exchanges as "edgy jokes," Governor Phil Scott condemned the "vile" dialogue and called for those involved to resign, underscoring the serious political and social ramifications.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Ange Postecoglou just 39 days after his appointment, making it the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. The dismissal followed a 3-0 defeat by Chelsea, capping a winless streak of eight matches across all competitions. Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis was present at the match, and the decision was conveyed by a senior club official. The club is now reportedly in contact with former Everton boss Sean Dyche and ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini as potential replacements. This marks Forest's third manager search this season, raising questions about the club's long-term strategy and stability.</p>

          <p>The Interstate 5 freeway through Camp Pendleton in Southern California was temporarily closed for a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire event, causing significant traffic delays and severing a primary link between San Diego and Orange counties. This article provides essential alternative routes for motorists, advising them to use Interstate 15 north or south, through Temecula and Lake Elsinore, to bypass the affected 17-mile stretch. The closure, directed by the White House for a military demonstration involving live ammunition fired over the freeway, also disrupted Amtrak and Metrolink rail services. California Highway Patrol recommended the closure due to "extreme life safety risk" and potential driver distraction.</p>

          <p>Israel has returned 15 Palestinian bodies to Gaza, following the identification of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit's remains, handed over by Hamas. This exchange is part of a ceasefire agreement, though 18 slain Israeli hostages are still in Gaza. Hamas accuses Israel of violating the ceasefire by closing the Rafah crossing, impeding recovery efforts and aid. Meanwhile, large crowds gathered in Tel Aviv to demand the return of remaining hostage bodies, and a UN aid chief described Gaza as a "wasteland," highlighting the monumental task of restoration. The ongoing situation underscores the complex humanitarian crisis and fragile nature of the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>This article serves as an obituary and tribute to the late musician D'Angelo, born Michael Eugene Archer, who passed away at 51 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. It reflects on his enigmatic career, his role as a "conjurer" who blended spiritual and secular themes, and his impact on "Black music" beyond the "neo-soul" label. The article discusses his discomfort with objectification following his "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" music video and his later work, particularly "Black Messiah," which addressed social commentary and racial strife. D'Angelo's dedication to his craft and his profound influence are celebrated as a testament to enduring art.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals German Media Bias Inflates Crime Reporting by Foreigners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 12:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study, "Crime and Migration: Perception in German Media," reveals a "drastic distortion" in German media, where foreign suspects are mentioned three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. Journalism professor Thomas Hestermann's team found that this "migrantization" of crime, particularly since 2015, influences public perception of violence and threat. Despite varied editorial orientations, reporting patterns often align with a right-wing populist agenda, overemphasizing culture as a factor in crime when perpetrators are non-German. The study advocates for greater editorial diversity to combat this unintentional but discriminatory bias and foster more accurate reporting.</p>
