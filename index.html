        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the legacy of conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his death, focusing on his significant impact on Gen Z politics. It details how his organization, Turning Point USA, transformed college conservatism from a niche belief into a mainstream cultural identity by blending political messaging with large-scale events. Kirk's mastery of social media and his willingness to engage in controversial debates are also highlighted as key factors in his appeal to a generation that values free speech and rejects established norms. His death leaves a notable void in the young conservative movement he helped build.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is petitioning a federal appeals court to allow the president to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ahead of a critical interest rate meeting. The move follows a lower court's decision to block Cook's removal, which was initiated based on allegations of mortgage misrepresentation. The Justice Department argues the president has broad authority to remove officials, while Cook's lawyers warn her dismissal could disrupt financial markets and politicize the Federal Reserve's independent decision-making process. The timing is crucial as the Fed's committee is expected to vote on lowering interest rates next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled its development of an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, attributing the decision to a slowdown in consumer demand for battery electric vehicles in North America. The project had already faced multiple delays from its original 2024 launch target. Instead of the fully electric model, the company will now focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, which incorporates a gasoline engine as a generator. This strategic shift is part of a broader reassessment of product strategy under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox delivered a public address calling for an end to political rage and division. Citing his "Disagree Better" initiative, Cox urged young Americans to embrace difficult conversations and reject violence as a political tool. The governor, known for his efforts to promote civility and bipartisan cooperation, framed the assassination as an attack on the fundamental American principle of free speech. His message of de-escalation stands in contrast to the increasingly polarized national political climate.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the collapse of Spirit Airlines, stating that the budget airline's business model is unsustainable and that he expects it to go out of business. Kirby argued that the ultra-low-cost carrier model, which relies on low base fares supplemented by numerous fees, alienates customers and is no longer viable. His comments come as Spirit recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year amid weak demand and high operational costs. Spirit has pushed back against Kirby's criticism, highlighting its new premium options.</p>

          <p>Officials have arrested and identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The arrest was made after family members of the suspect contacted law enforcement, leading to his capture. According to investigators, Robinson had expressed dislike for Kirk's viewpoints, and evidence recovered includes a rifle and bullet cartridges with anti-fascist messages inscribed on them. Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced the arrest and confirmed that prosecutors will be seeking the death penalty in what he termed a political assassination.</p>

While the president claims local Democratic leaders are happy with the decision, Memphis Mayor Paul Young had previously requested financial resources rather than a military deployment.

          <p>Over 3,000 striking Boeing defense workers in the St. Louis area have voted to reject the company's most recent contract proposal, extending a walkout that began in August. The union representing the workers stated that the offer did not include a sufficient signing bonus or adequate improvements to 401(k) benefits compared to other Boeing contracts. The striking employees, who primarily assemble F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, will remain on the picket line. In response, Boeing expressed disappointment and stated it will continue with its contingency plan, which includes hiring permanent replacement workers.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the prime minister's resignation, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as the interim prime minister. Karki, 73, is the first woman to lead the country and her appointment is part of a deal to quell the widespread unrest that saw over 50 people killed. The protests were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew into a mass movement against the political elite. Karki's government now faces the challenge of restoring order and preparing for general elections scheduled for next March.</p>

          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds, investors are watching closely as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates. While some on Wall Street predict this "wall of cash" will flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds, others are more skeptical. Experts note that money fund assets have historically only declined when rates are near zero, and a minor rate cut is unlikely to prompt a mass exodus from these accounts. The funds have become a primary tool for institutional and corporate cash management, which is less sensitive to small rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to remember several key strategies to capitalize on the opportunity. This article emphasizes that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates in anticipation of Federal Reserve actions, meaning the best rates may appear before an official cut. It also reiterates the importance of having a high credit score to qualify for the most favorable terms and securing a pre-approval to demonstrate seriousness to sellers. Finally, it suggests buyers prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate, as refinancing is always a future option. (not investment advice)</p>

His arrest in March on separate corruption charges sparked widespread protests.

Democratic leaders are demanding the reversal of recent changes to Medicaid and an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. President Trump has urged Republicans not to negotiate, creating a stalemate that will likely require a short-term funding measure to avoid a lapse in government services.

The decision lifts a lower court's injunction, allowing the administration to enforce a provision aimed at "defunding" the reproductive health organization. Planned Parenthood estimates that up to 200 of its clinics, many in medically underserved areas, could be forced to close as a result, severely impacting access to services like cancer screenings, STI testing, and contraception for 1.1 million Medicaid-eligible patients. The organization called the move a "backdoor abortion ban."</p>
