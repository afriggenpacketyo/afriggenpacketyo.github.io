          <p>Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its nearly three-decade run as a public company.

          <p>The Department of Education has resumed collecting on defaulted student loans after a nearly five-year pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with collections restarting on May 5. A recent analysis reveals that delinquency rates among student loan borrowers are at an all-time high, with approximately 20% of borrowers at risk of defaulting. Defaulting on a loan can lead to wage garnishment, withholding of Social Security benefits, and a significant drop in credit scores, impacting future loan opportunities. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that taxpayers should not bear the burden of irresponsible student loan policies. Optimism is tempered by the challenges borrowers face in repaying their debts.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to persistent delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport. The disruptions, impacting hundreds of flights, have led to concerns about the airport's ability to handle summer traffic. Schumer cites a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, DOGE-related budget cuts, and outdated technology as contributing factors. United Airlines is cutting flights, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area." Schumer seeks scrutiny of bonus allocations and equipment replacement plans, emphasizing the potential for widespread airport issues if the FAA does not address these shortages effectively.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is embroiled in a dispute with neighbors in West Lake Hills, Texas, over unpermitted construction around his $6 million mansion. Residents have complained about the 16-foot chain-link fence, outward-facing camera, and increased traffic caused by security personnel. The construction violated six city ordinances, leading to a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting where retroactive permission was denied. Unless the City Council disagrees, Musk may have to alter or remove the fence and gate to comply with local regulations. This situation highlights the challenges even the wealthiest individuals face when navigating local regulations and neighborhood concerns.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are pushing to pass a comprehensive bill codifying President Trump's agenda into law by July 4th, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the United States' founding. The bill seeks to advance Trump's policies on tax, defense, energy, immigration, and border security, while also addressing the debt limit. A key component involves extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), with warnings that failure to do so could result in tax increases for millions of families. However, divisions within the GOP over Medicaid cuts and clean energy subsidies pose challenges to meeting this ambitious deadline.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, creating uncertainty for projects in Alaska aimed at reducing reliance on expensive diesel fuel. In Noatak, Alaska, residents face high electricity costs due to the need to fly in diesel, prompting the community to invest in solar panels. However, potential repeal of clean energy tax credits threatens these projects, leaving villagers financially insecure. Senator Lisa Murkowski is advocating for the tax credits, arguing they are crucial for rural communities lacking access to natural gas pipelines. This intraparty conflict underscores the challenges of balancing fiscal conservatism with the needs of constituents benefiting from renewable energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a proposed 100% tariff on foreign films, citing a threat to national security from movies not shot in the United States. This move has raised concerns about xenophobia and a lack of understanding of the film industry's financial and creative realities. While some productions are lured overseas by tax credits, others seek unique landscapes and cities for authenticity. The article argues that limiting film production to the US could result in a loss of diversity and exposure to different cultures, ultimately diminishing the empathy-generating potential of cinema.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz as a maximum-security prison for America's most dangerous criminals. Trump stated the reopening would symbolize law, order, and justice, aiming to restore Alcatraz's original purpose of housing incorrigible inmates. The original Alcatraz closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, as everything had to be transported to the island. The current Alcatraz is a museum administered by the National Park Service.

Hess argues that while online preparation is common, it cannot truly prepare one for the experience of having a baby. The book critiques the monetization of parental helplessness by experts and the illusion of control sold through apps, gadgets, and courses. Ultimately, Hess suggests that the meaningfulness of parenting lies in its inherent lack of control and the acceptance of its unpredictable nature.</p>

The approach aims to create a culture of responsibility and sidestep political scrutiny, though it may not counter sophisticated disinformation campaigns.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is restarting collections on defaulted federal student loans, which can severely damage borrowers' credit scores. A TransUnion analysis shows that consumers who faced default in recent months have seen their credit scores fall by an average of 63 points, with super prime borrowers experiencing drops of up to 175 points. Borrowers with excellent credit are particularly vulnerable to significant score reductions. This can make it harder to obtain credit and result in higher interest rates on loans.

          <p>President Trump is considering imposing a 100% tariff on foreign movies, suggesting that it could be achieved through a national emergency declaration. He described incentives offered by other countries for movie production as a threat to national security. Trump has previously used similar language before formal declarations. The White House has not provided specific plans, but Trump has authorized the Department of Commerce and his trade representative to begin the process of instituting the tariff. The announcement has already impacted shares of companies like Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Walt Disney.</p>

          <p>A European Central Bank study reveals a growing trend of European consumers avoiding U.S. products and services due to President Trump's trade war. The imposition of tariffs and threats of further trade restrictions have caused consumers to actively seek alternatives to American brands, regardless of cost. Grassroots boycotts and social media campaigns promoting European alternatives have gained traction. The shift suggests a potential long-term change in consumer preferences, even if trade tensions ease. This could impact U.S. companies and investors who are closely monitoring international markets for signs of anti-American sentiment.</p>
