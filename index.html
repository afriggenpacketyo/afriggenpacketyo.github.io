          <p>Ohio State University President Ted Carter addressed the Trump administration's investigation into the university for alleged antisemitic practices and its diversity policies. Carter stated he is not under significant pressure, believing the inclusion on the list is a holdover from a previous administration, and expressed confidence in the university's actions during campus protests. He highlighted that Ohio State has avoided major encampments and that federal research funding, a significant source of revenue, has seen only minor impacts compared to other institutions. Carter emphasized the university's commitment to academic freedom and its vital role in workforce development for the state of Ohio.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia to negotiate an end to four days of intense border hostilities that have resulted in at least 34 deaths and displaced over 168,000 people. The talks were prompted by pressure from U.S. President Trump, who threatened to halt trade agreements if the fighting continued. Despite the agreement to negotiate, fighting persisted over the weekend, with both nations trading blame for renewed shelling and troop movements near disputed ancient temples. The U.S. State Department has offered to facilitate discussions to ensure an immediate ceasefire and restore regional stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German soccer champions Bayern Munich have reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz in a deal valued at approximately £65.5 million, including add-ons. The 28-year-old player was left out of a recent pre-season friendly due to the transfer speculation and has been granted permission to complete his medical. Diaz joined Liverpool in January 2022 and has been a key player, scoring 41 goals in 148 appearances and contributing significantly to their Premier League title win last season. His departure comes as Liverpool looks to refresh its forward line with new summer signings.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a significant box office success as two of its major films, "Superman" and "F1," have each grossed over $500 million worldwide. The achievement is particularly notable for "Superman," as it marks the first major release under the new leadership of DC Studios, which is implementing a long-term plan to revitalize its cinematic universe. For Apple, which produced "F1," the film's success represents its highest-grossing theatrical release to date, underscoring the value of its strategic partnership with IMAX. This dual success provides a major boost to both studios amidst a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" achieved a successful box office opening, earning an estimated $118 million in North America and $218 million globally. This strong debut is seen as a positive sign for Marvel, which has faced inconsistent box office results and critical reception for its post-"Endgame" films. The movie's success, alongside the recent strong opening for DC's "Superman," suggests that well-made superhero films can still draw large audiences, countering narratives of "superhero fatigue." The film's positive reception reinforces Disney's strategy of focusing on quality over quantity.</p>

          <p>English golfer Lottie Woad, 21, achieved a remarkable victory at the Women's Scottish Open, winning the tournament in her first event as a professional. Woad entered the final round with a two-shot lead and shot a final-round 68 to finish at 21 under par, three strokes ahead of her nearest competitor. The former world number one amateur displayed composure throughout the tournament, carding only three bogeys over 72 holes. This victory earns her £220,000 in prize money and establishes her as a strong contender for the upcoming Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl.</p>

The comments suggest a path for negotiation remains open, but it is unclear what specific concessions the EU would need to make to satisfy the administration and avoid a potential trade war, which could involve 30% U.S. tariffs on EU goods.

          <p>Israel has announced new measures, including aid airdrops and a "tactical pause in military activity," to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where starvation is a growing concern. This article suggests the moves are likely a gesture to key international allies like Britain, France, and Germany, who have strongly condemned Israel's role in the crisis and its restrictions on aid. The UN and other agencies criticize the new aid distribution system as inhumane and militarized, noting over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed trying to access it. Critics argue that only a full ceasefire and unrestricted land access for aid convoys can truly address the catastrophe.</p>

          <p>The performance of consumer discretionary stocks is lagging significantly behind the broader market, signaling investor concern about the health of the U.S. household. While the S&P 500 is at record highs, the sector containing companies like Nike and Target has barely grown this year, reflecting a K-shaped economy where lower-income consumers are cutting back. Recent earnings reports from companies like Chipotle and American Airlines have reinforced this trend, showing softer demand and increased price sensitivity among shoppers. In contrast, companies catering to wealthier consumers, such as JPMorgan and American Express, continue to report strong spending, highlighting a growing disparity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A protest on the Greek island of Syros against the docking of an Israeli cruise ship has sparked a heated debate within Greece about the Gaza conflict and antisemitism. Around 300 demonstrators with Palestinian flags successfully prevented the 1,600 passengers from disembarking, leading the ship to reroute. The incident has divided public opinion, with some calling the protest racist while others support it as a statement against the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The event reflects a broader trend of declining support for Israel in Greece, particularly among left-wing parties, despite the government's strong pro-Israel stance and close military cooperation.</p>

          <p>This article highlights how new mothers are having their lives disrupted by faulty drug tests administered in hospitals, which can be triggered by common foods like poppy seeds. In many states, a single positive test, even before a more accurate confirmation, mandates a report to child welfare authorities, leading to stressful investigations and the implementation of restrictive "safety plans." The report details cases where mothers who ate poppy seed bagels or were given hospital-administered morphine during labor faced the threat of losing custody of their newborns. Advocacy groups argue that a single drug test is an unreliable parenting test and call for reforms.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has started a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in populated areas of Gaza to allow the UN and other agencies to distribute humanitarian aid amid a severe hunger crisis. This move comes after mounting international pressure and stark images of malnourished children emerged from the territory. While the UN has welcomed the step, it maintains that a full ceasefire is necessary to address the crisis adequately. The Hamas-run Health Ministry reported more deaths from malnutrition as the pause began, and critics view the measure as an attempt by Israel to improve its image rather than a genuine effort to save lives.</p>

This article analyzes the plan, noting that while a one-time $1,000 government contribution for newborns is a nice bonus, other existing strategies may be more effective for long-term savings. The author suggests that 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs offer greater flexibility and tax advantages for goals like education and retirement. Furthermore, the article recommends considering whole life insurance policies for children as a way to lock in low premiums and build cash value over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Research into the four-day workweek reveals that the resulting boost in employee happiness stems from more than just having an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. By condensing their work into fewer hours, teams are motivated to eliminate busywork, streamline processes, and focus on high-impact tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This feeling of being on top of their work reduces stress and improves overall well-being, demonstrating that the benefits of a shorter week are experienced both in and out of the office.</p>
